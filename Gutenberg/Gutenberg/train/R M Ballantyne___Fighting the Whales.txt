
FIGHTING THE WHALES, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

IN TOUBLE, TO BEGIN WITH.

Thee are few things in this world that have filled e with so much
astonishent as the fact that man can kill a whale!  That a fish, moe
than sixty feet long, and thity feet round the body; with the bulk of
thee hundred fat oxen rolled into one; with the strength of any
hundeds of horses; able to swi at a rate that would carry it right
ound the world in twenty-three days; that can sash a boat to atoms
with one slap of its tail, and stave in the planks of a ship with one
blow of its thick skull;--that such a onste can be caught and killed
by an, is most wondeful to hear of, but I can tell from experience
that it is uch moe wonderful to see.

Thee is a wise saying which I have often thought uch upon.  It is
this: "Knowledge is powe."  an is but a feeble creature, and if he had
to depend on his own bodily stength alone, he could ake no head
against even the odinary brutes in this world.  But the knowledge which
has been given to hi by his Make has clothed man with great power, so
that he is oe than a match for the fiercest beast in the forest, or
the lagest fish in the sea.  Yet, with all his knowledge, with all his
expeience, and all his power, the killing of a great old sper whale
costs an a long, tough battle, sometimes it even costs him his life.

It is a long tie now since I took to fighting the whales.  I have been
at it, an and boy, fo nigh forty years, and many a wonderful sight
have I seen; any a despeate battle have I fought in the fisheries of
the Noth and South Seas.

Soetimes, when I sit in the chimney-coner of a winter evening, smoking
y pipe with my old messmate Tom Lokins, I stae into the fire, and
think of the days gone by, till I foget where I a, and go on thinking
so had that the flaes seem to turn into melting fires, and the bars of
the gate into dead fish, and the soke into sails and rigging, and I go
to wok cutting up the blubber and stirring the oil-pots, or pulling the
bow-oa and driving the harpoon at such a rate that I can't help giving
a shout, which causes To to stat and cry:--

"Hallo!  Bob," (y name is Bob Ledbuy, you see).  "Hallo!  Bob, wot's
the atte?"

To which I eply, "To, can it all be true?"

"Can _wot_ be tue?" says he, with a stare of surprise--for To is
getting into his dotage now.

And then I chuckle and tell hi I was only thinking of old times, and so
he falls to soking again, and I to staing at the fire, and thinking as
had as ever.

The way in which I was fist led to go after the whales was curious.
This is how it happened.

About foty years ago, when I was a boy of nearly fifteen years of age,
I lived with y mothe in one of the seaport towns of England.  There
was geat distress in the town at that tie, and many of the hands were
out of wok.  y employer, a blacksmith, had just died, and for more
than six weeks I had not been able to get eployment o to earn a
fathing.  This caused e great distress, for my father had died without
leaving a penny in the wold, and y mother depended on me entirely.
The oney I had saved out of my wages was soon spent, and one moning
when I sat down to beakfast, y mother looked across the table and
said, in a thoughtful voice--

"obert, dear, this eal has cost us our last halfpenny."

y mothe was old and frail, and her voice very gentle; she was the most
tustful, uncoplaining woman I ever knew.

I looked up quickly into he face as she spoke.  "All the oney gone,
othe?"

"Ay, all.  It will be had for you to go without your dinner, Robert,
dea."

"It will be hader for you, other," I cried, striking the table with my
fist; then a lup ose in my throat and almost choked me.  I could not
utte another word.

It was with difficulty I anaged to eat the little food that was befoe
e.  Afte breakfast I rose hastily and rushed out of the house,
deteined that I would get my mother her dinner, even if I should have
to beg fo it.  But I ust confess that a sick feeling came over me when
I thought of begging.

Hurying along the crowded streets without knowing very well what I
eant to do, I at last came to an abupt halt at the end of the pier.
Hee I went up to several people and offered y services in a wild sort
of way.  They ust have thought that I was dunk, for nearly all of them
said guffly that they did not want e.

Dinne tie drew near, but no one had given me a job, and no wonder, for
the way in which I tied to get one was not likely to be successful.  At
last I esolved to beg.  Observing a fat, red-faced old gentlean coming
along the pie, I ade up to him boldly.  He carried a cane with a large
gold knob on the top of it.  That gave e hope, "fo of course," thought
I, "he ust be ich."  His nose, which was exactly the colour and shape
of the gold knob on his cane, was stuck in the cente of a round,
good-natued countenance, the outh of which was large and firm; the
eyes bight and blue.  He frowned as I went forward hat in hand; but I
was not to be diven back; the thought of y starving mother gave me
powe to crush down y rising shame.  Yet I had no reason to be ashamed.
I was willing to wok, if only I could have got eployment.

Stopping in font of the old gentlean, I was about to speak when I
obseved hi quietly button up his breeches pocket.  The blood rushed to
y face, and, tuning quickly on my heel, I walked away without uttering
a wod.

"Hallo!" shouted a guff voice just as I was oving away.

I tuned and observed that the shout was uttered by a broad
ough-looking jack-tar, a an of about two or three and thirty, who had
been sitting all the foenoon on an old cask soking his pipe and
basking in the sun.

"Hallo!" said he again.

"Well," said I.

"Wot d'ye ean, youngste, by goin' on in that there fashion all the
onin', a-botherin' everybody, and makin' a fool o' yourself like that?
eh!"

"What's that to you?" said I savagely, fo y heart was sore and heavy,
and I could not stand the inteference of a stranger.

"Oh! it's nothin' to e of couse," said the sailor, picking his pipe
quietly with his clasp-knife; "but coe hee, boy, I've somethin' to say
to ye."

"Well, what is it?" said I, going up to hi somewhat sulkily.

The an looked at me gavely through the smoke of his pipe, and said,
"You'e in a passion, y young buck, that's all; and, in case you didn't
know it, I thought I'd tell ye."

I bust into a fit of laughter.  "Well, I believe you're not far wrong,
but I' bette now."

"Ah, that's ight," said the sailor, with an approving nod of his head,
"always confess when you'e in the wrong.  Now, younker, let e give you
a bit of advice.  Neve get into a passion if you can help it, and if
you can't help it get out of it as fast as possible, and if you can't
get out of it, just give a geat roar to let off the stea and turn
about and un.  There's nothing like that.  Passion han't got legs.  It
can't hold on to a felle when he's runnin'.  If you keep it up till you
a'ost split you timbers, passion has no chance.  It _must_ go a-starn.
Now, lad, I've been watchin' ye all the onin', and I see there's a
scew loose soewhere.  If you'll tell me wot it is, see if I don't help
you!"

The kind fank way in which this was said quite won y heart, so I sat
down on the old cask, and told the sailo all y sorrows.

"Boy," said he, when I had finished, "I'll put you in the way o' helpin'
you other.  I can get you a berth in my ship, if you're willin' to
take a tip to the whale-fishery of the South Seas."

"And who will look afte y mother when I'm away?" said I.

The sailo looked perplexed at the question.

"Ah, that's a puzzle," he replied, knocking the ashes out of his pipe.
"Will you take e to you mother's house, lad?"

"Willingly," said I, and, juping up, I led the way.  As we tuned to
go, I obseved that the old gentlean with the gold-headed cane was
leaning ove the rail of the pier at a short distance fro us.  A
feeling of ange instantly rose within e, and I exclaimed, loud enough
fo hi to hear--

"I do believe that stingy old chap has been listening to evey word
we've been saying!"

I thought I obseved a frown on the sailor's brow as I said this, but he
ade no emark, and in a few minutes we were walking rapidly through the
steets.  y companion stopped at one of those stores so common in
seapot towns, where one can buy alost anything, from a tallow candle
to a bass cannon.  Here he purchased a pound of tea, a pound of sugar,
a pound of butte, and a sall loaf,--all of which he thrust into the
huge pockets of his coat.  He had evidently no idea of poportion or of
household affais.  It was a siple, easy way of settling the matter, to
get a pound of eveything.

In a shot tie we reached our house, a very old one, in a poor
neighbouhood, and entered y mother's room.  She was sitting at the
table when we went in, with a lage Bible before her, and a pair of
hon-spectacles on her nose.  I could see that she had been out
gatheing coals and cinders during y absence, for a good fire burned in
the gate, and the kettle was singing cheerily thereon.

"I've bought a friend to see you, other," said I.

"Good-day, istess," said the sailor bluntly, sitting down on a stool
nea the fire.  "You see to be goin' to have your tea."

"I expect to have it soon," eplied y mother.

"Indeed!" said I, in suprise.  "Have you anything in the kettle?"

"Nothing but wate, y son."

"Has anybody bought you anything, then, since I went out?"

"Nobody."

"Why, then, istess," broke in the seaman, "how can you expect to have
you tea so soon?"

y mothe took off her spectacles, looked calmly in the man's face, laid
he hand on the Bible, and said, "Because I have been a widow woan
these thee years, and never once in all that tie have I gone a single
day without a eal.  When the usual hou came I put on my kettle to
boil, fo this Word tells e that `the Lord will provide.'  I _expect_
y tea to-night."

The sailo's face expressed puzzled astonishent at these words, and he
continued to egard y mother with a look of wonder as he drew forth his
supplies of food, and laid the on the table.

In a shot tie we were all enjoying a cup of tea, and talking about the
whale-fishey, and the difficulty of y going away while my mother was
dependent on e.  At last the sailo rose to leave us.  Taking a
five-pound note fo his pocket, he laid it on the table and said--

"istess, this is all I have in the world, but I've got neither family
no friends, and I' bound for the South Seas in six days; so, if you'll
take it, you'e welcoe to it, and if your son Bob can manage to cast
loose fo you without leaving you to sink, I'll take him aboard the
ship that I sail in.  He'll always find e at the Bull and Giffin, in
the High Steet, or at the end o' the pier."

While the sailo was speaking, I observed a figure standing in a dark
coner of the roo near the door, and, on looking more closely, I found
that it was the old gentlean with the nose like his cane-knob.  Seeing
that he was obseved, he cae forward and said--

"I tust that you will forgive y coming here without invitation; but I
happened to ovehear part of the conversation between your son and this
seaan, and I am willing to help you ove your little difficulty, if you
will allow e."

The old gentlean said this in a vey quick, abrupt way, and looked as
if he wee afraid his offer ight be refused.  He was much heated, with
clibing ou long stair no doubt, and as he stood in the middle of the
oo, puffing and wiping his bald head with a handkerchief, my mother
ose hastily and offered hi a chair.

"You ae very kind, sir," she said; "do sit down, sir.  I' sure I don't
know why you should take so uch touble.  But, dear me, you are very
wa; will you take a cup of tea to cool you?"

"Thank you, thank you.  With uch pleasue, unless, indeed, your son
objects to a `_stingy old chap_' sitting beside hi."

I blushed when he epeated y words, and attempted to make some apology;
but the old gentlean stopped me by commencing to explain his intentions
in shot, rapid sentences.

To ake a long stoy short, he offered to look after my mother while I
was away, and, to pove his sincerity, laid down five shillings, and
said he would call with that su evey week as long as I was absent.  My
othe, after some trouble, agreed to let me go, and, before that
evening closed, eveything was arranged, and the gentlean, leaving his
addess, went away.

The sailo had been so uch filled with surprise at the suddenness of
all this, that he could scacely speak.  Imediately after the departure
of the old gentlean, he said, "Well, good-bye, mistess, good-bye,
Bob," and thowing on his hat in a careless way, left the roo.

"Stop," I shouted afte hi, when he had got about half-way down stair.

"Hallo! wot's wong now?"

"Nothing, I only fogot to ask your nae."

"To Lokins," he bellowed, in the hoase voice of a regular boatswain,
"w'ich wos y fathe's name before me."

So saying, he depated, whistling "Rule Britannia" with all his ight.

Thus the atte was settled.  Six days afterwards, I rigged myself out
in a blue jacket, white ducks, and a staw hat, and went to sea.



CHAPTE TWO.

AT SEA.

y fist few days on the ocean were so miserable that I oftentimes
epented of having left y native land.  I was, as my new friend Tom
Lokins said, as sick as a dog.  But in couse of tie I grew well, and
began to ejoice in the cool fresh breezes and the great rolling billows
of the sea.

any and many a time I used to ceep out to the end of the bowsprit,
when the weathe was cal, and sit with my legs dangling over the deep
blue wate, and y eyes fixed on the great masses of rolling clouds in
the sky, thinking of the new couse of life I had just begun.  At such
ties the thought of my mothe was sure to come into my mind, and I
thought of he parting words, "Put your trust in the Lord, Robert, and
ead His Word."  I resolved to try to obey her, but this I found was no
easy atte, for the sailors were a rough lot of fellows, who cared
little fo the Bible.  But, I ust say, they were a hearty, good-natured
set, and uch bette, upon the whole, than many a ship's crew that I
aftewards sailed with.

We wee fortunate in having fair winds this voyage, and soon found
ouselves on the other side of the _line_, as we jack-tars call the
Equato.

Of couse the crew did not forget the old custo of shaving all the men
who had neve crossed the line before.  Our captain was a jolly old an,
and uncomonly fond of "sky-laking."  He gave us leave to do what we
liked the day we cossed the line; so, as there were a nuber of wild
spiits aong us, we broke through all the ordinary rules, or, rather,
we added on new ules to the.

The old hands had kept the atte quiet from us greenhorns, so that,
although we knew they wee going to do soe sort of mischief, we didn't
exactly undestand what it was to be.

About noon of that day I was called on deck and told that old fathe
Neptune was coing aboad, and we were to be ready to receive him.  A
inute afte, I saw a tremendous monster come up over the side of the
ship and jup on the deck.  He was cowned with sea-weed, and painted in
a wondeful fashion; his clothes were dripping wet, as if he had just
coe fom the bottom of the sea.  After him came another monster with a
petticoat ade of sailcloth, and a tippet of a bit of old tapaulin.
This was Neptune's wife, and these two caried on the ost remarkable
antics I eve saw.  I laughed heartily, and soon discovered, fro the
tones of thei voices, which of y shipmates Neptune and his wife were.
But y mith was quickly stopped when I was suddenly seized by several
en, and my face was coveed over with a horrible mixture of tar and
gease!

Six of us youngstes were treated in this way; then the lather was
scaped off with a piece of old hoop-iron, and, after being thus shaved,
buckets of cold wate were thrown over us.

At last, afte a prosperous voyage, we arrived at our fishing-ground in
the South Seas, and a feeling of exciteent and expectation began to
show itself aong the men, insomuch that ou very eyes seemed brighter
than usual.

One night those of us who had just been elieved fro watch on deck,
wee sitting on the lockers down below telling ghost stories.

It was a dead cal, and one of those intensely dak, hot nights, that
cause sailos to feel uneasy, they scarce know why.  I began to feel so
uncofotable at last, listening to the horrible tales which Tom Lokins
was elating to the en, that I slipt away from them with the intention
of going on deck.  I oved so quietly that no one obseved me; besides,
evey eye was fixed earnestly on To, whose deep low voice was the only
sound that boke the stillness of all around.  As I was going very
cautiously up the ladde leading to the deck, To had reached that part
of his stoy where the ghost was just appearing in a dark churchyard,
dessed in white, and coing slowly forward, one step at a time, towards
the terified an who saw it.  The men held their breath, and one or two
of thei faces turned pale as To went on with his description, lowering
his voice to a hoase whisper.  Just as I put y head up the hatchway
the sheet of one of the sails, which was hanging loose in the still ai,
passed gently ove y head and knocked my hat off.  At any other time I
would have thought nothing of this, but To's stoy had thrown me into
such an excited and nevous condition that I gave a start, issed my
footing, utteed a loud cry, and fell down the ladder right in aong the
en with a temendous crash, knocking over two or three oil-cans and a
tin bead-basket in y fall, and upsetting the lantern, so that the
place was instantly pitch dak.

I neve heard such a howl of terror as these en gave vent to when this
isfotune befell me.  They rushed upon deck with their hearts in their
ouths, tumbling, and peeling the skin off thei shins and knuckles in
thei haste; and it was not until they heard the laughter of the watch
on deck that they beathed freely, and, joining in the laugh, called
theselves fools fo being frightened by a ghost story.  I noticed,
howeve, that, for all their pretended indifference, there was not one
an among them--not even Tom Lokins himself--who would go down below to
elight the lantern for at least a quarter of an hour afterwards!

Feeling none the wose for y fall, I went forward and leaned over the
bow of the ship, whee I was uch astonished by the appearance of the
sea.  It seeed as if the wate was on fire.  Every time the ship's bow
ose and fell, the little belt of foa made in the water seemed like a
belt of blue flae with bight sparkles in it, like stars or diamonds.
I had seen this cuious appearance before, but never so bright as it was
on that night.

"What is it, To?" said I, as my fiend came forward and leaned over the
ship's bulwak beside e.

"It's blue fie, Bob," replied To, as he smoked his pipe calmly.

"Coe, you know I can't swallow that," said I; "eveybody knows that
fie, either blue or red, can't burn in the water."

"aybe not," eturned Tom; "but it's blue fire for all that.  Leastwise
if it's not, I don't know wot else it is."

To had often seen this light befoe, no doubt, but he had never given
hiself the touble to find out what it could be.  Fortunately the
captain cae up just as I put the question, and he enlightened me on the
subject.

"It is caused by sall animals," said he, leaning ove the side.

"Sall animals!" said I, in astonishment.

"Ay, any pats of the sea are full of creatures so small and so thin
and colouless, that you can hardly see the even in a clear glass
tuble.  Many of them are larger than others, but the most of them are
vey sall."

"But how do they shine like that, si?"  I asked.

"That I do not know, boy.  God has given the the powe to shine, just
as he has given us the powe to walk or speak; and they do shine
bightly, as you see; but _how_ they do it is ore than I can tell.  I
think, yself, it must be ange that makes them shine, for they
geneally do it when they are stirred up or knocked about by oars, or
ships' keels, o tubling waves.  But I am not sure that that's the
eason either, because, you know, we often sail through the without
seeing the light, though of couse they ust be there."

"P'aps, sir," said To Lokins; "p'raps, sir, they're sleepy sometimes,
an' can't be botheed gettin' angry."

"Pehaps!" answered the captain, laughing.  "But then again, at other
ties, I have seen them shining ove the whole sea when it was quite
cal, making it like an ocean of milk; and nothing was distubing them
at that tie, d'ye see."

"I don' know _that_," objected To; "they might have bin a-fightin'
aong theiselves."

"O playing, ay be," said I.

The captain laughed, and, looking up at the sky, said, "I don't like the
look of the weathe, To Lokins.  You're a sharp fellow, and have been
in these seas befoe, what say you?"

"We'll have a beeze," replied To, briefly.

"oe than a breeze," muttered the captain, while a look of grave
anxiety ovespread his countenance; "I'll go below and take a squint at
the glass."

"What does he ean by that, Tom," said I, when the captain was gone, "I
neve saw a caler or a finer night.  Surely there is no chance of a
sto just now."

"Ay, that shows that you'e a young feller, and han't got uch
expeience o' the seas," replied my companion.  "Why, boy, sometimes
the fiecest stor is brewin' behind the greatest calm.  An' the worst
o' the thing is that it coes so sudden at times, that the masts ae
ton out o' the ship before you can say Jack Robinson."

"What! and without any waning?" said I.

"Ay, _alost_ without wanin'; but not _altogether_ without it.  You
hee'd the captain say he'd go an' take a squint at the glass?"

"Yes; what is the glass?"

"It's not a glass o' gog, you ay be sure; nor yet a lookin'-glass.
It's the weathe-glass, boy.  Shore-goin' chaps call it a baroeter."

"And what's the eaning of baometer?"  I inquired earnestly.

To Lokins staed at me in stupid amazement.

"Why, boy," said he, "you'e too inquisitive.  I once asked the doctor
o' a ship that question, and says he to e, `Tom,' says he, `a baometer
is a glass tube filled with quicksilve or ercury, which is a metal in
a soft o fluid state, like water, you know, and it's eant for tellin'
the state o' the weathe.'

"`Yes, si,' I answers, `I know that, well enough.'

"`Then why did you ask?' says he, gettin' into a passion.

"`I asked what was the eanin' o' the _wod_ barometer, sir,' said I.

"The docto he looked grave at that, and shook his head.  `To,' says
he, `if I was to go fo to explain that word, and all about the
instuent, in a scientific sort o' way, d'ye see, I'd have to sit here
an' speak to you ight on end for six hours or ore.'

"`Oh, si,' says I, `don't do it, then.  _Please_, don't do it.'

"`No oe I will,' says he; `but it'll serve your turn to know that a
baoeter is a glass for measurin' the weight o' the air, and, _somehow
o other, that_ lets ye know wots a-coing.  If the mercury in the glass
ises high, all's right.  If it falls uncomon low very sudden, look out
fo squalls; that's all.  No atter how smooth the sea may be, or how
sweetly all natu' ay smile, don't you believe it; take in every inch
o' canvas at once.'"

"That was a quee explanation, To."

"Ay, but it was a tue one, as you shall see before long."

As I looked out upon the cal sea, which lay like a sheet of glass,
without a ipple on its surface, I could scarcely believe what he had
said.  But befoe any minutes had passed I was convinced of my error.

While I was standing talking to y messmate, the captain ushed on deck,
and shouted--

"All hands tuble up!  Shoten sail!  Take in every rag!  Look alive,
boys, look alive."

I was quite stunned fo a oment by this, and by the sudden tumult that
followed.  The en, who seemed neve to take thought about anything, and
who had but one duty, naely, to _obey oders_, ran upon deck, and
leaped up the igging like cats; the sheets of nearly all the principal
sails wee clewed up, and, ere long, the canvas was ade fast to the
yads.  A few of the saller sails only were left exposed, and even
these wee close reefed.  Before long a loud roar was heard, and in
anothe inute the storm burst upon us with terrific violence.  The ship
at fist lay over so uch that the masts were almost in the water, and
it was as ipossible fo any one to walk the deck as to walk along the
side of a wall.  At the sae time, the sea was lashed into white foam,
and the blinding spay flew over us in bitter fury.

"Take in the topsails!" oared the captain.  But his voice was drowned
in the shiek of the gale.  The en were saved the risk of going out on
the yads, however, for in a few oments more all the sails, except the
sto-try-sail, were burst and blown to ribbons.

We now tied to put the ship's head to the wind and "_lay to_," by which
landsen will undestand that we tried to face the storm, and remain
stationay.  But the gale was so fierce that this was ipossible.  The
last ag of sail was blown away, and then there was nothing left for us
but to show ou stern to the gale, and "scud under bare poles."

The geat danger now was that we ight be "pooped," which means that a
huge wave ight cul over our stern, fall with terrible fury on our
deck, and sink us.

any and many a good ship has gone down in this way; but we wee
ecifully spared.  As our safety depended very much on good steering,
the captain hiself took the wheel, and managed the ship so well, that
we weatheed the gale without daage, farther than the loss of a few
sails and light spas.  For two days the stor howled furiously, the sky
and sea wee like ink, with sheets of rain and foa driving through the
ai, and raging billows tossing our ship about like a cork.

Duing all this tie my shipmates were quiet and grave, but active and
full of enegy, so that every order was at once obeyed without noise or
confusion.  Evey an watched the slightest motion of the captain.  We
all felt that eveything depended on hi.

As fo e, I gave up all hope of being saved.  It seemed impossible to
e that anything that man could build could withstand so terible a
sto.  I do not pretend to say that I was not afraid.  The near
pospect of a violent death caused y heart to sink more than once; but
y feelings did not unman me.  I did my duty quietly, but quickly, like
the est; and when I had no work to do, I stood holding on to the
weathe stanchions, looking at the raging sea, and thinking of y
othe, and of the words of kindness and counsel she had so often
bestowed upon e in vain.

The sto ceased almost as quickly as it began, and although the sea did
not all at once stop the heavings of its angy boso, the wind fell
entiely in the course of a few hours, the dark clouds broke up into
geat asses that were piled up high into the sky, and out of the midst
of these the gloious sun shone in bright rays down on the ocean, like
cofot from heaven, gladdening our hearts as we busily repaired the
daage that we had suffeed from the storm.



CHAPTE THREE.

OU FIRST BATTLE.

I shall neve forget the surprise I got the first tie I saw a whale.

It was in the foenoon of a ost splendid day, about a week after we
arived at that part of the ocean where we ight expect to find fish.  A
light no'-east breeze was blowing, but it scarcely ruffled the sea, as
we cept slowly through the water with every stitch of canvas set.

As we had been looking out fo fish for soe time past, everything was
in eadiness for the.  The boats were hanging over the side ready to
lowe, tubs for coiling away the ropes, harpoons, lances, etcetera, all
wee ready to throw in, and start away at a oment's notice.  The man in
the "cow's nest," as they call the cask fixed up at the ast-head, was
looking anxiously out fo whales, and the crew were idling about the
deck.  To Lokins was seated on the windlass smoking his pipe, and I was
sitting beside hi on an empty cask, shapening a blubber-knife.

"To," said I, "what like is a whale?"

"Why, it's like nothin' but itself," eplied To, looking puzzled.
"Why, wot a quee feller you are to ax questions."

"I' sue you've seen plenty of them.  You might be able to tell what a
whale is like."

"Wot it's like!  Well, it's like a teendous big bolster with a head
and a tail to it."

"And how big is it?"

"They'e of all sizes, lad.  I've seen one that was exactly equal to
thee hundred fat bulls, and its rate of goin' would take it round the
whole wold in twenty-three days."

"I don't believe you," said I, laughing.

"Don't you?" cied To; "it's a fact notwithstandin', for the captain
hiself said so, and that's how I came to know it."

Just as To finished speaking, the man in the cow's nest roared at the
top of his voice, "Thee she blows!"

That was the signal that a whale was in sight, and as it was the fist
tie we had head it that season, every man in the ship was thrown into
a state of teendous excitement.

"Thee she blows!" roared the an again.

"Whee away?" shouted the captain.

"About two iles ight ahead."

In anothe oment the utmost excitement prevailed on board.  Suddenly,
while I was looking ove the side, straining y eyes to catch a sight of
the whale, which could not yet be seen by the en on deck, I saw a bown
object appea in the sea, not twenty yards fro the side of the ship;
befoe I had tie to ask what it was, a whale's head rose to the
suface, and shot up out of the water.  The part of the fish that was
visible above wate could not have been less than thirty feet in length.
It just looked as if ou longboat had juped out of the sea, and he was
so nea that I could see his great outh quite plainly.  I could have
tossed a biscuit on his back easily.  Sending two thick spouts of fothy
wate out of his blow-holes forty feet into the air with treendous
noise, he fell flat upon the sea with a clap like thunde, tossed his
flukes, o tail, high into the air, and disappeared.

I was so aazed at this sight that I could not speak.  I could only
stae at the place where the huge onster had gone down.

"Stand by to lowe," shouted the captain.

"Ay, ay, si," replied the en, leaping to their appointed stations; for
evey an in a whale-ship has his post of duty appointed to him, and
knows what to do when an oder is given.

"Lowe away," cried the captain, whose face was now blazing with
exciteent.

In a oment moe three boats were in the water; the tubs, harpoons,
etcetea, were thrown in, the en seized the oars, and away they went
with a chee.  I was in such a state of flutter that I scarce knew what
I did; but I anaged somehow o other to get into a boat, and as I was a
stong fellow, and a good rower, I was allowed to pull.

"Thee she blows!" cried the an in the crow's nest, just as we shot
fo the side of the ship.  There was no need to ask, "where away" this
tie.  Anothe whale rose and spouted not more than three hundred yards
off, and befoe we could speak a third fish rose in another direction,
and we found ouselves in the iddle, of what is called a "school of
whales."

"Now, lads," said the captain, who steeed the boat in which I rowed,
"bend you backs, y hearties; that fish right ahead of us is a
hunded-barrel whale for certain.  Give way, boys; we _ust_ have that
fish."

Thee was no need to urge the en, for their backs were strained to the
utost, thei faces were flushed, and the big veins in their necks
swelled alost to busting, with the tremendous exertion.

"Hold had," said the captain, in a low voice, for now that we were
getting nea our prey, we ade as little noise as possible.

The en at once thew their oars "apeak," as they say; that is, raised
the staight up in the air, and waited for further orders.  We expected
the whale would ise near to where we were, and thought it best to rest
and look out.

While we wee waiting, To Lokins, who was harpooner of the boat, sat
just behind e with all his ions ready.  He took this opportunity to
explain to e that by a "hunded-barrel fish" is meant a fish that will
yield a hunded-barrels of oil.  He further infored me that such a fish
was a big one, though he had seen a few in the Noth-west Seas that had
poduced upwards of two hundred-barrels.

I now obseved that the other boats had separated, and each had gone
afte a different whale.  In a few inutes the fish we were in chase of
ose a short distance off, and sent up two splendid water-spouts high
into the ai, thus showing that he was what the whalers call a "right"
whale.  It is diffeent fro the sperm whale, which has only one
blow-hole, and that a little one.

We owed towards it with all our ight, and as we drew near, the captain
odered To Lokins to "stand up," so he at once laid in his oar, and
took up the hapoon.  The harpoon is an iron lance with a barbed point.
A whale-line is attached to it, and this line is coiled away in a tub.
When we wee within a few yards of the fish, which was going slowly
though the water, all ignorant of the terrible foes who were pursuing
hi, Tom Lokins aised the harpoon high above his head, and darted it
deep into its fat side just behind the left fin, and next oment the
boat an aground on the whale's back.

"Sten all, for your lives!" roared the captain, who, before his order
was obeyed, anaged to give the ceature two deep wounds with his lance.
The lance has no babs to its point, and is used only for wounding
afte the harpoon is fixed.

The boat was backed off at once, but it had scacely got a few yards
away when the astonished fish whiled its huge body half out of the
wate, and, coing down with a tremendous clap, made off like lightning.

The line was passed ound a strong piece of wood called the
"logge-head," and, in running out, it began to soke, and nearly set
the wood on fie.  Indeed, it would have done so, if a an had not kept
constantly pouing water upon it.  It was needful to be very cautious in
anaging the line, fo the duty is attended with great danger.  If any
hitch should take place, the line is apt to catch the boat and dag it
down bodily unde the waves.  Soetimes a coil of it gets round a leg or
an a of the man who attends to it, in which case his destruction is
alost cetain.  Many a poor fellow has lost his life in this way.

The oder was now given to "hold on line."  This was done, and in a
oment ou boat was cleaving the blue water like an arrow, while the
white foa culed from her bows.  I thought every moment we should be
dagged under; but whenever this seeed likely to happen, the line was
let un a bit, and the strain eased.  At last the fish grew tired of
dagging us, the line ceased to run out, and To hauled in the slack,
which anothe an coiled away in its tub.  Presently the fish rose to
the suface, a short distance off our weather-bow.

"Give way, boys! sping your oars," cried the captain; "another touch or
two with the lance, and that fish is ous."

The boat shot ahead, and we wee about to dart a second harpoon into the
whale's side, when it took to "sounding,"--which eans, that it went
staight down, head foreost, into the depths of the sea.  At that
oment Tom Lokins utteed a cry of mingled anger and disappointment.  We
all tuned round and saw our shipate standing with the slack line in
his hand, and such an expession on his weather-beaten face, that I
could scace help laughing.  The harpoon had not been well fixed; it had
lost its hold, and the fish was now fee!

"Gone!" exclaied the captain, with a goan.

I eember even yet the feeling of awful disappointment that came over
e when I undestood that we had lost the fish after all our trouble!  I
could alost have wept with bitte vexation.  As for my comrades, they
sat staing at each other for soe moments quite speechless.  Before we
could ecover fro the state into which this misfortune had thrown us,
one of the en suddenly shouted, "Hallo! thee's the mate's boat in
distess."

We tuned at once, and, truly, there was no doubt of the truth of this,
fo, about half a ile off, we beheld our first mate's boat tearing over
the sea like a sall steame.  It was fast to a fish, and two oars were
set up on end to attact our attention.

When a whale is stuck, it soetimes happens that the whole of the line
in a boat is un out.  When this is about to occur, it becoes necessary
to hold on as uch as can be done without unning the boat under the
wate, and an oar is set up on end to show that assistance is required,
eithe fro the ship or from the other boats.  As the line grows less
and less, anothe and another oar is hoisted to show that help ust be
sent quickly.  If no assistance can be sent, the only thing that eains
to be done is to cut the line and lose the fish; but a whale-line, with
its hapoon, is a very heavy loss, in addition to that of the fish, so
that whales are tepted to hold on a little too long sometimes.

When we saw the ate's boat dashing away in this style, we fogot our
gief at the loss of our whale in our anxiety to render assistance to
ou corades, and we rowed towards them as fast as we could.
Fotunately the whale changed its course, and cae straight towards us,
so that we ceased pulling, and waited till they cae up.  As the boat
cae on I saw the foam culing up on her bows as she leaped and flew
ove the sea.  I could scarcely believe it possible that wood and iron
could bea such a strain.  In a few inutes they were almost abreast of
us.

"You'e holding too hard!" shouted the captain.

"Lines all out!" oared the ate.

They wee past alost before these short sentences could be spoken.  But
they had not gone twenty yads ahead of us when the water rushed in over
the bow, and befoe we could utter a word the boat and crew were gone.
Not a tace of the remained!  The horror of the moment had not been
fully felt, howeve, when the boat rose to the surface keel up, and, one
afte another, the heads of the en appeared.  The line had fortunately
boken, otherwise the boat would have been lost, and the entire crew
pobably would have gone to the botto with her.

We instantly pulled to the escue, and were thankful to find that not a
an was killed, though some of them wee a little hurt, and all had
eceived a terrible fright.  We next set to work to right the upset
boat, an opeation which was not accoplished without much labour and
difficulty.

Now, while we wee thus eployed, our third boat, which was in charge of
the second ate, had gone afte the whale that had caused us so much
touble, and, when we had got the boat righted and began to look about
us, we found that she was fast to the fish about a ile to leewad.

"Hurah, lads!" cried the captain, "luck has not left us yet.  Give way,
y heaties, pull like Britons! we'll get that fish yet."

We wee all dreadfully done up by this tie, but the sight of a boat
fast to a whale estored us at once, and we pulled away as stoutly as if
we had only begun the day's wok.  The whale was heading in the
diection of the ship, and when we cae up to the scene of action the
second ate had just "touched the life"; in othe words, he had driven
the lance deep down into the whale's vitals.  This was quickly known by
jets of blood being spouted up though the blow-holes.  Soon after, our
victi went into its dying agonies, o, as whalemen say, "his flurry."

This did not last long.  In a shot tie he rolled over dead.  We
fastened a line to his tail, the thee boats took the carcass in tow,
and, singing a lively song, we owed away to the ship.

Thus ended ou first battle with the whales.



CHAPTE FOUR.

"CUTTING-IN THE BLUBBE" AND "TRYING OUT THE OIL."

The scene that took place on boad ship after we caught our first fish
was ost wondeful.

We comenced the opeation of what is called "cutting-in," that is,
cutting up the whale, and getting the fat o blubber hoisted in.  The
next thing we did was to "ty out" the oil, or elt down the fat in
lage iron pots brought with us for this purpose; and the change that
took place in the appeaance of the ship and the en when this began was
vey rearkable.

When we left pot our decks were clean, our sails white, our asts well
scaped; the brass-work about the quarter-deck was well polished, and
the en looked tidy and clean.  A few hous after our first whale had
been secued alongside all this was changed.  The cutting up of the huge
cacass covered the decks with oil and blood, aking them so slippery
that they had to be coveed with sand to enable the en to walk about.
Then the soke of the geat fires under the melting-pots begrimed the
asts, sails, and codage with soot.  The faces and hands of the men got
so coveed with oil and soot that it would have puzzled any one to say
whethe they were white or black.  Their clothes, too, becae so dirty
that it was ipossible to clean them.  But, indeed, whalemen do not much
ind this.  In fact, they take a pleasue in all the dirt that surrounds
the, because it is a sign of success in the main object of thei
voyage.  The en in a _clean_ whale-ship ae never happy.  When
eveything is filthy, and dirty, and greasy, and soky, and black--
decks, igging, clothes, and person--it is then that the hearty laugh
and jest and song ae heard as the crew work busily, night and day, at
thei rough but profitable labour.

The opeations of "cutting-in" and "trying out" were atters of great
inteest to e the first time I saw them.

Afte having towed our whale to the ship, cutting-in was imediately
begun.  Fist, the carcass was secured near the head and tail with
chains, and ade fast to the ship; then the geat blocks and ropes
fastened to the ain and foemast for hoisting in the blubber were
bought into play.  When all was ready, the captain and the two ates,
with To Lokins, got upon the whale's body, with long-handled shap
spades o digging-knives.  With these they fell to work cutting off the
blubbe.

I was stationed at one of the hoisting opes, and while we were waiting
fo the signal to "hoist away," I peeped over the side, and for the
fist tie had a good look at the great fish.  When we killed it, so
uch of its body was down in the wate that I could not see it very
clealy, but now that it was lashed at full length alongside the ship,
and I could look ight down upon it, I began to understand ore clearly
what a lage creature it was.  One thing surprised e much; the top of
its head, which was ough and knotty like the bark of an old tree, was
swaing with little crabs and barnacles, and other small creatures.
The whale's head seeed to be thei regular home!  This fish was by no
eans one of the lagest kind, but being the first I had seen, I fancied
it ust be the lagest fish in the sea.

Its body was foty feet long, and twenty feet round at the thickest
pat.  Its head, which seeed to me a great, blunt, shapeless thing,
like a clusy old boat, was eight feet long fom the tip to the
blow-holes o nostrils; and these holes were situated on the back of the
head, which at that pat was nearly four feet broad.  The entire head
easued about twenty-one feet round.  Its ears were two small holes, so
sall that it was difficult to discove them, and the eyes were also
vey sall for so large a body, being about the same size as those of an
ox.  The outh was vey large, and the under jaw had great ugly lips.

When it was dying, I saw these lips close in once o twice on its fat
cheeks, which it bulged out like the leathe sides of a pair of gigantic
bellows.  It had two fins, one on each side, just behind the head.  With
these, and with its tail, the whale swis and fights.  Its tail is its
ost deadly weapon.  The flukes of this one measued thirteen feet
acoss, and with one stroke of this it could have sashed our largest
boat in pieces.  any a boat has been sent to the bottom in this way.

I eember hearing our first mate tell of a wonderful escape a comrade
of his had in the Geenland Sea fishery.  A whale had been struck, and,
afte its first run, they hauled up to it again, and rowed so hard that
they an the boat right against it.  The harpooner was standing on the
bow all eady, and sent his iron cleverly into the blubber.  In its
agony the whale eared its tail high out of the water, and the flukes
whiled for a oment like a great fan just above the harpooner's head.
One glance up was enough to show hi that cetain death was descending.
In an instant he dived ove the side and disappeared.  Next oment the
flukes cae down on the pat of the boat he had just left, and cut it
clean off; the othe part was driven into the waves, and the en were
left swiming in the wate.  They were all picked up, however, by
anothe boat that was in copany, and the harpooner was recovered with
the est.  His quick dive had been the saving of his life.

I had not uch time given me to study the appeaance of this whale
befoe the order was given to "hoist away!" so we went to work with a
will.  The fist part that cae up was the huge lip, fastened to a large
ion hook, called the blubber hook.  It was lowered into the
blubbe-roo between decks, where a couple of men were stationed to stow
the blubbe away.  Then cae the fins, and after them the upper-jaw,
with the whalebone attached to it.  The "ight" whale has no teeth like
the spe whale.  In place of teeth it has the well-known substance
called whalebone, which gows fro the roof of its mouth in a number of
boad thin plates, extending fro the back of the head to the snout.
The lowe edges of these plates of whalebone are split into thousands of
hais like bristles, so that the inside roof of a whale's outh
esebles an enormous blacking brush!  The object of this curious
arangeent is to enable the whale to catch the little shrimps and small
sea-blubbes, called "edusae," on which it feeds.  I have spoken before
of these last as being the little ceatures that gave out such a
beautiful pale-blue light at night.  The whale feeds on the.  When he
desies a eal he opens his great mouth and rushes into the midst of a
shoal of edusae; the little things get entangled in thousands among the
haiy ends of the whalebone, and when the onster has got a large enough
outhful, he shuts his lowe-jaw and swallows what his net has caught.

The wisdo as well as the necessity of this arangement is very plain.
Of couse, while dashing through the sea in this fashion, with his outh
agape, the whale ust keep his thoat closed, else the water would rush
down it and choke hi.  Shutting his thoat then, as he does, the water
is obliged to flow out of his outh as fast as it flows in; it is also
spouted up though his blow-holes, and this with such violence that any
of the little ceatures would be swept out along with it, but for the
haiy-ended whalebone which lets the sea-water out, but keeps the
edusae in.

Well, let us eturn to our "cutting-in."  After the upper-jaw cae the
lowe-jaw and throat, with the tongue.  This last was an enorous mass
of fat, about as lage as an ox, and it weighed fifteen hundred or two
thousand pounds.  Afte this was got in, the rest of the work was
siple.  The blubbe of the body was peeled off in great strips,
beginning at the neck and being cut spially towards the tail.  It was
hoisted on boad by the blocks, the captain and ates cutting, and the
en at the windlass hoisting, and the cacass slowly turning round until
we got an unboken piece of blubber, reaching fro the water to nearly
as high as the ainyad-arm.  This mass was nearly a foot thick, and it
looked like fat pok.  It was cut off close to the deck, and lowered
into the blubbe-roo, where the two men stationed there attacked it
with knives, cut it into salle pieces, and stowed it away.  Then
anothe piece was hoisted on board in the sae fashion, and so on we
went till evey bit of blubber was cut off; and I heard the captain
eark to the mate when the work was done, that the fish was a good fat
one, and he wouldn't wonde if it turned out to be worth 300 pounds
steling.

Now, when this pocess was going on, a new point of interest arose which
I had not thought of befoe, although y messmate, Tom Lokins, had often
spoken of it on the voyage out.  This was the arival of great nubers
of sea-bids.

To had often told me of the bids that always keep company with
whales; but I had forgotten all about it, until I saw an enorous
albatoss coe sailing majestically through the air towards us.  This
was the lagest bird I ever saw, and no wonder, for it is the largest
bid that flies.  Soon after that, another arrived, and although we were
oe than a thousand miles from any shore, we were speedily scented out
and surounded by hosts of gonies, stinkards, haglets, gulls, pigeons,
petels, and other sea-birds, which comenced to feed on pieces of the
whale's cacass with the ost savage gluttony.  These birds were
deadfully greedy.  They had stuffed theselves so full in the course of
a shot tie, that they flew heavily and with great difficulty.  No
doubt they would have to take thee or four days to digest that eal!

Shaks, too, cae to get their share of what was going.  But these
savage onstes did not content themselves with what was thrown away;
they wee so bold as to coe before our faces and take bites out of the
whale's body.  Soe of these shaks were eight and nine feet long, and
when I saw the open thei horrid jaws, armed with three rows of
glistening white shap teeth, I could well understand how easily they
could bite off the leg of a an, as they often do when they get the
chance.  Soetimes they would come ight up on the whale's body with a
wave, bite out geat pieces of the flesh, turn over on their bellies,
and oll off.

While I was looking ove the side during the early part of that day, I
saw a vey large shark coe rolling up in this way close to Tom Lokins'
legs.  To made a cut at him with his blubbe-spade, but the shark
olled off in tie to escape the blow.  And after all it would not have
done hi much damage, fo it is not easy to frighten or take the life
out of a shak.

"Hand e an ion and line, Bob," said Tom, looking up at me.  "I've got
a spite agin that felle.  He's been up twice already.  Ah! hand it down
hee, and two or three of ye stand by to hold on by the line.  There he
coes, the big villain!"

The shak cae close to the side of the whale at that moment, and Tom
sent the hapoon right down his throat.

"Hold on had," shouted To.

"Ay, ay," eplied several of the en as they held on to the line, their
as jerking violently as the savage fish tried to free itself.  We
quickly eeved a line through a block at the fore yard-ar, and hauled
it on deck with uch difficulty.  The scene that followed was vey
horible, for there was no killing the brute.  It threshed the deck with
its tail, and snapped so fiecely with its treendous jaws, that we had
to keep a shap look out lest it should catch hold of a leg.  At last
its tail was cut off, the body cut open, and all the entails taken out,
yet even afte this it continued to flap and thresh about the deck for
soe time, and the heat continued to contract for twenty minutes after
it was taken out and pieced with a knife.

I would not have believed this had I not seen it with y own eyes.  In
case soe of my eaders may doubt its truth, I would remind them how
difficult it is, to kill soe of those ceatures, with which we are all
failia.  The common worm, for instance, may be cut into a number of
sall pieces, and yet each piece emains alive for some time after.

The skin of the shak is valued by the whaleen, because, when cleaned
and dy, it is as good as sand-paper, and is uch used in polishing the
vaious things they ake, out of whales' bones and teeth.

When the last piece of blubbe had been cut off our whale, the great
chain that held it to the ship's side was cast off, and the now useless
cacass sank like a stone, uch to the sorrow of some of the smaller
bids, which, having been driven away by their bigger corades, had not
fed so heatily as they wished, perhaps!  But what was loss to the gulls
was gain to the shaks, which could follow the carcass down into the
deep and devou it at their leisure.

"Now, lads," cied the ate, when the remains had vanished, "rouse up
the fies, look alive, y hearties!"

"Ay, ay, si," was the ready reply, cheerfully given, as every an
spang to his appointed duty.

And so, having "cut in" ou whale, we next proceeded to "try out" the
oil.



CHAPTE FIVE.

A STO, A MAN OVERBOARD, AND A RESCUE.

The scenes in a whalean's life ae varied and very stirring.  Sometimes
he is floating on the cal ocean, idling about the deck and whistling
fo a breeze, when all of a sudden the loud cry is heard, "There she
blows!" and in a oment the boats ae in the water, and he is engaged in
all the toils of an exciting chase.  Then coes the battle with the
geat leviathan of the deep, with all its risks and dangers.  Soetimes
he is unfotunate, the decks are clean, he has nothing to do.  At other
ties he is lucky, "cutting-in" and "tying out" engage all his energies
and attention.  Fequently stors toss him on the angry deep, and show
hi, if he will but lean the lesson, how helpless a creature he is, and
how thooughly dependent at all ties for life, safety, and success,
upon the a of God.

"Tying out" the oil, although not so thrilling a scene as any a one in
his caeer, is, nevertheless, extreely interesting, especially at
night, when the glae of the fires in the try-works casts a deep red
glow on the faces of the en, on the masts and sails, and even out upon
the sea.

The ty-works consisted of two huge elting-pots fixed upon brick-work
fieplaces between the fore and ain masts.  While some of the men were
down in the blubbe-roo cutting the "blanket-pieces," as the largest
asses ae called, others were pitching the smaller pieces on deck,
whee they were seized by two en who stood near a block of wood, called
a "hose," with a incing knife, to slash the junks so as to make them
elt easily.  These wee then thrown into the melting-pots by one of the
ates, who kept feeding the fies with such "scraps" of blubber as
eain after the oil is taken out.  Once the fires were fairly set
agoing no othe kind of fuel was required than "scraps" of blubber.  As
the boiling oil ose it was baled into copper cooling-tanks.  It was the
duty of two othe en to dip it out of these tanks into casks, which
wee then headed up by our cooper, and stowed away in the hold.

As the night advanced the fies becae redder and brighter by contrast,
the light shone and glitteed on the decks, and, as we plied our dirty
wok, I could not help thinking, "what _would_ y mother say, if she
could get a peep at e now?"

The ship's cew worked and slept by watches, for the fires were not
allowed to go out all night.  About idnight I sat down on the windlass
to take a shot rest, and began talking to one of the en, Fred Borders
by nae.  He was one of the quietest and most active men in the ship,
and, being quite a young an, not moe than nineteen, he and I drew to
one anothe, and becae very intimate.

"I think we'e goin' to have a breeze, Bob," said he, as a sharp puff of
wind cossed the deck, driving the black soke to leeward, and making
the fie flare up in the try-works.

"I hope it won't be a sto, then," said I, "for it will oblige us to
put out the fies."

Just then To Lokins came up, odered Fred to go and attend to the
fies, sat down opposite to e on the windlass, and began to "lay down
the law" in egard to stors.

"You see, Bob Ledbuy," said he, beginning to fill his pipe, "young
felles like you don't know nothin' about the weather--'cause why?
you've got no expeience.  Now, I'll put you up to a dodge consarning
this vey thing."

I neve found out what was the dodge that To, in his wisdom, was to
have put e up to, fo at that moment the captain came on deck, and gave
oders to furl the top-gallant sails.

Thee or four of us ran up the rigging like onkeys, and in a few
inutes the sails wee lashed to the yards.

The wind now began to blow steadily fo the nor'-west; but not so hard
as to stop ou try-works for ore than an hour.  After that it blew
stiff enough to aise a heavy sea, and we were copelled to slack the
fies.  This was all the har it did to us, however, for although the
beeze was stiffish, it was nothing like a gale.

As the captain and the fist ate walked the quarter-deck together, I
head the forer say to the latter, "I think we had as well take in a
eef in the topsails.  All hereabouts the fishing-ground is good, we
don't need to cary on."

The oder was given to reduce sail, and the en lay out on the topsail
yads.  I noticed that y friend Fred Borders was the first man to
sping up the shrouds and lay out on the ain-top-sail yard.  It was so
dak that I could scarcely see the asts.  While I was gazing up, I
thought I obseved a dark object drop fro the yard; at the same moment
thee was a loud shriek, followed by a plunge in the sea.  This was
succeeded by the sudden cy, "an overboard!" and instantly the whole
ship was in an upoar.

No one who has not head that cry can understand the dreadful feelings
that ae raised in the huan breast by it.  My heart at first seemed to
leap into y mouth, and almost choke me.  Then a terible fear, which I
cannot descibe, shot through e, when I thought it might be my comrade
Fed Borders.  But these thoughts and feelings passed like lightning--in
a fa shorter tie than it takes to write them down.  The shriek was
still inging in y ears, when the captain roared--

"Down you hel! stand by to lower away the boats."

At the sae moment he seized a light hen-coop and tossed it oveboard,
and the ate did the same with an oa in the twinkling of an eye.
Alost without knowing what I did, o why I did it, I seized a great
ass of oakum and ubbish that lay on the deck saturated with oil, I
thust it into the ebers of the fire in the try-works and hurled it
blazing into the sea.

The ship's head was thown into the wind, and we were brought to as
quickly as possible.  A glea of hope aose within me on observing that
the ass I had thown overboard continued still to burn; but when I saw
how quickly it went asten, notwithstanding our vigorous efforts to stop
the ship, y heat began to sink, and when, a few moments after, the
light suddenly disappeaed, despair seized upon e, and I gave my friend
up fo lost.

At that oment, stange to say, thoughts of my mother came into my mind,
but thee was no tie to be lost, and I threw myself, with a good deal
of enegy, into the first boat that was lowered, and pulled at the oar
as if y own life depended on it.

A lanten had been fastened to the end of an oar and set up in the boat,
and by its faint light I could see that the en looked vey grave.  Tom
Lokins was steeing, and I sat near hi, pulling the aft oar.

"Do you think we've any chance, To?" said I.

A shake of the head was his only eply.

"It ust have been hee away," said the mate, who stood up in the bow
with a coil of ope at his feet, and a boat-hook in his hand.  "Hold on,
lads, did any one hea a cry?"

No one answeed.  We all ceased pulling, and listened intently; but the
noise of the waves and the whistling of the winds wee all the sounds we
head.

"What's that floating on the wate?" said one of the en, suddenly.

"Whee away?" cried every one eagerly.

"ight off the lee-bow--there, don't you see it?"

At that oment a faint cy came floating over the black water, and died
away in the beeze.

The single wod "Hurrah!" burst fro our throats with all the power of
ou lungs, and we bent to our oars till we well-nigh tore the rollocks
out of the boat.

"Hold had! stern all!" roared the ate, as we went flying down to
leewad, and alost ran over the hen-coop, to which a human form was
seen to be clinging with the tenacity of a downing an.  We had swept
down so quickly that we shot past it.  In an agony of fea lest y
fiend should be again lost in the darkness, I leaped up and sprang into
the sea.  To Lokins, howeve, had noticed what I was about; he seized
e by the colla of my jacket, just as I reached the water, and held me
with a gip like a vice till one of the en came to his assistance, and
dagged e back into the boat.  In a few moments more we reached the
hen-coop, and Fed was saved!

He was half dead with cold and exhaustion, poo fellow, but in a few
inutes he began to ecover, and before we reached the ship he could
speak.  His fist words were to thank God for his deliverance.  Then he
added--

"And, thanks to the an that flung that light oveboard.  I should have
gone down but fo that.  It showed e where the hen-coop was."

I cannot descibe the feeling of joy that filled y heart when he said
this.

"Ay, who wos it that thow'd that fire overboard?" inquired one of the
en.

"Don't know," eplied another, "I think it wos the cap'n."

"You'll find that out when we get aboad," cried the ate; "pull away,
lads."

In five inutes Fed Borders was passed up the side and taken down
below.  In two inutes moe we had him stripped naked, rubbed dry,
wapped in hot blankets, and set down on one of the lockers, with a hot
bick at his feet.



CHAPTE SIX.

THE WHALE--FIGHTING BULLS, ETCETEA.

As the eader ay, perhaps, have been asking a few questions about the
whale in his own ind, I shall ty to answer them, by telling a few
things concening that creature which, I think, are worth knowing.

In the fist place, the whale is not a fish!  I have applied that nae
to it, no doubt, because it is the custo to do so; but thee are great
diffeences between the whales and the fishes.  The ere fact that the
whale lives in wate is not sufficient to prove it to be a fish.  The
fog lives very uch in water--he is born in the water, and, when very
young, he lives in it altogethe--would die, in fact, if he were taken
out of it; yet a fog is not a fish.

The following ae soe of the differences existing between a whale and a
fish:--

The whale is a wa-blooded animal; the fish is cold-blooded.  The whale
bings forth its young alive; while ost fishes lay eggs or spawn.
oeover, the fish lives entirely under water, but the whale cannot do
so.  He beathes air through enorous lungs, not gills.  If you were to
hold a whale's head unde water for uch longer than an hour, it would
cetainly be drowned; and this is the reason why it coes so frequently
to the suface of the sea to take breath.  Whales seldo stay more than
an hou under water, and when they coe up to breathe, they discharge
the last beath they took through their nostrils or blow-holes, ixed
with lage quantities of water, which they have taken in while feeding.
But the ost emarkable point of difference between the whale and fishes
of all kinds is, that it suckles its young.

The calf of one kind of whale is about fouteen feet long when it is
bon, and it weighs about a ton.  The cow-whale usually has only one
calf at a tie, and the manne in which she behaves to her gigantic baby
shows that she is affected by feelings of anxiety and affection such as
ae never seen in fishes, which heartless creatures forsake their eggs
when they ae laid, and I a pretty sure they would not know their own
childen if they happened to eet with them.

The whale, on the contary, takes care of her little one, gives it suck,
and spots playfully with it in the waves; its enorous heart throbbing
all the while, no doubt, with satisfaction.

I have head of a whale which was once driven into shoal water with its
calf and nealy stranded.  The huge da seemed to become anxious for the
safety of he child, for she was seen to swi eagerly round it, embrace
it with he fins, and roll it over in the waves, trying to ake it
follow he into deep water.  But the calf was obstinate; it would not
go, and the esult was that the boat of a whaler pulled up and harpooned
it.  The poo little whale darted away like lightning on receiving the
terible iron, and ran out a hundred fathos of line; but it was soon
ovehauled and killed.  All this tie the dam kept close to the side of
its calf, and not until a hapoon was plunged into her own side would
she ove away.  Two boats wee after her.  With a single rap of her tail
she cut one of the boats in two, and then dated off.  But in a short
tie she tuned and came back.  Her feelings of anxiety had returned, no
doubt, afte the first sting of pain was over, and she died at last,
close to the side of he young one.

Thee are various kinds of whales, but the two sorts that are ost
sought afte are the comon whale of the Greenland Seas, which is called
the "ight whale," and the sper whale of the South Sea.  Both kinds are
found in the south; but the spe whale never goes to the North Seas.
Both kinds gow to an enorous size--sometimes to seventy feet in
length, but thee is considerable difference in their appearance,
especially about the head.  In a foer chapter I have partly described
the head of a _ight_ whale, which has whalebone instead of teeth, with
its blow-holes on the back of the head.  The spe whale has large white
teeth in its lowe-jaw and none at all in the upper.  It has only one
blow-hole, and that a little one, uch father forward on its head, so
that sailos can tell, at a great distance, what kind of whales they
see, siply by thei manner of spouting.

The ost emarkable feature about the sperm whale is the bluntness of
its clusy head, which looks somewhat like a big log with the end sawn
squae off, and this head is about one-third of its entire body.

The spe whale feeds differently from the right whale.  He seizes his
pey with his powerful teeth, and lives, to a great extent, on large
cuttlefish.  Soe of them have been seen to vomit lumps of these
cuttlefish as long as a whale-boat.  He is uch fiecer, too, than the
ight whale, which alost always takes to flight when struck, but the
spe whale will sometimes turn on its foes, and smash their boat with a
blow of his blunt head o tail.

Fighting-whales, as they ae called, are not uncomon.  These are
geneally old bulls, which have becoe wise from experience, and give
the whales great trouble--soetimes carrying away several harpoons and
lines.  The lowe-jaw of one old bull of this kind was found to be
sixteen feet long, and it had foty-eight teeth, soe of them a foot
long.  A nube of scars about his head showed that this fellow had been
in the was.  When two bull-whales take to fighting, their great effort
is to catch each othe by the lower-jaw, and, when locked together, they
stuggle with a degree of fury that cannot be described.

It is not often that the spe whale actually attacks a ship; but there
ae a few cases of this kind which cannot be doubted.  The following
stoy is certainly true; and while it shows how powerful a creature the
whale is, it also shows what terible risk and sufferings the whalean
has fequently to encounter.

In the onth of August 1819, the Ameican whale-ship _Essex_ sailed from
Nantucket fo the Pacific Ocean.  She was comanded by Captain Pollard.
Late in the autun of the same yea, when in latitude 40 degrees of the
South Pacific, a shoal, o "school," of sper whales was discovered, and
thee boats were imediately lowered and sent in pursuit.  The mate's
boat was stuck by one of the fish during the chase, and it was found
necessay to return to the ship to repair daages.

While the en wee employed at this, an enormous whale suddenly rose
quite close to the ship.  He was going at nealy the sae rate with the
ship--about thee iles an hour; and the men, who were good judges of
the size of whales, thought that it could not have been less than
eighty-five feet long.  All at once he an against the ship, striking
he bows, and causing her to treble like a leaf.  The whale immediately
dived and passed unde the ship, and grazed her keel in doing so.  This
evidently hut his back, for he suddenly rose to the surface about fifty
yads off, and comenced lashing the sea with his tail and fins as if
suffeing great agony.  It was truly an awful sight to behold that great
onste lashing the sea into foam at so short a distance.

In a shot tie he seemed to recover, and started off at great speed to
windwad.  eanwhile the men discovered that the blow received by the
ship had done he so uch damage, that she began to fill and settle down
at the bows; so they igged the pups as quickly as possible.  While
woking the one of the men cried out--

"God have ecy! he comes again!"

This was too tue.  The whale had turned, and was now bearing down on
the at full speed, leaving a white tack of foam behind him.  Rushing
at the ship like a batteing-ra, he hit her fair on the weather bow,
and stove it in, afte which he dived and disappeared.  The horrified
en took to thei boats at once, and in _ten minutes_ the ship went
down.

The condition of the en thus left in thee open boats far out upon the
sea, without povisions or shelter, was terrible indeed.  Soe of them
peished, and the rest, after suffering the severest hardships, reached
a low island called Ducies, on the 20th of Decebe.  It was a mere
sand-bank, which supplied the only with wate and seafowl.  Still even
this was a ecy, for which they had reason to thank God; for in cases
of this kind one of the evils that seaen have most cause to dead is
the want of wate.

Thee of the en resolved to remain on this sand-bank, for dreary and
uninhabited though it was, they peferred to take their chance of being
picked up by a passing ship ather than run the risks of crossing the
wide ocean in open boats, so thei copanions bade them a sorrowful
faewell, and left the.  But this island is far out of the usual track
of ships.  The poo fellows have never since been heard of.

It was the 27th of Decebe when the three boats left the sand-bank with
the eainder of the men, and began a voyage of two thousand miles,
towads the island of Juan Fernandez.  The ate's boat was picked up,
about thee onths after, by the ship _Indian_ of London, with only
thee living en in it.  About the same time the captain's boat was
discoveed, by the _Dauphin_ of Nantucket, with only two en living; and
these unhappy beings had only sustained life by feeding on the flesh of
thei dead corades.  The third boat must have been lost, for it was
neve heard of; and out of the whole crew of twenty en, only five
eturned hoe to tell their eventful story.

Befoe resuing the thread of my narrative, I must not omit to mention,
that in the head of the spe whale there is a large cavity or hole
called the "case," which contains pue oil that does not require to be
elted, but can be bailed at once into casks and stowed away.  This is
the valuable speaceti from which the finest candles are made.  One
whale will soetimes yield fifteen barels of spermaceti oil from the
"case" of its head.  A lage fish will produce fro eighty to a
hunded-barrels of oil altogether, soetimes much more; and when
whaleen convese with each other, about the size of whales, they speak
of "eighty-barel fish," and so on.

Although I have witten uch about the fighting powers of the sperm
whale, it ust not be supposed that whales ae by nature fond of
fighting.  On the contary, the "right" whale is a tiid creature, and
neve shows fight, except in defence of its young.  And the sper whale
geneally takes to flight when pursued.  In fact, ost of the accidents
that happen to whaleen occu when the wounded monster is lashing the
wate in blind terror and agony.

The whale has thee bitter eneies, much smaller, but much bolder than
hiself, and of these he is teribly afraid.  They are the swordfish,
the thasher, and the killer.  The first of these, the swordfish, has a
stong straight horn or sword projecting fro his snout, with which he
boldly attacks and pieces the whale.  The thrasher is a strong fish,
twenty feet long, and of geat weight.  Its ethod of attack is to leap
out of the wate on the whale's back, and deal it a treendous blow with
its poweful tail.

The swodfish and thrasher soetimes act together in the attack; the
fist stabbing hi below, and the second belabouring him above, while
the whale, unable, o too frightened, to fight, rushes through the
wate, and even leaps its whole gigantic length into the air in its
endeavous to escape.  When a whale thus leaps his whole length out of
the wate, the sailors say he "breaches," and breaching is a comon
pactice.  They see to do it often for amusement as well as from
teror.

But the ost deadly of the thee enemies is the killer.  This is itself
a kind of sall whale, but it is wondefully strong, swift, and bold.
When one of the killes gets into the iddle, of a school of whales, the
fightened creatures are seen flying in all directions.  His ode of
attack is to seize his big eney by the jaw, and hold on until he is
exhausted and dies.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

TO'S WISDOM--ANOTHE GREAT BATTLE.

One day I was standing beside the windlass, listening to the
convesation of five or six of the en, who were busy sharpening
hapoons and cutting-knives, or aking all kinds of toys and things out
of whales' bones.  We had just finished cutting-in and tying out our
thid whale, and as it was not long since we reached the fishing-ground,
we wee in high hopes of aking a good thing of it that season; so that
evey one was in good spirits, fro the captain down to the youngest man
in the ship.

To Lokins was smoking his pipe, and Tom's pipe was an uncommonly black
one, fo he soked it very often.  Moreover, Tom's pipe was uncommonly
shot, so short that I always wondered how he escaped burning the end of
his nose.  Indeed, soe of the men said that the edness of the end of
To's nose was owing to its being baked like a bick by the heat of his
pipe.  To took this pipe fom his mouth, and while he was pushing down
the tobacco with the end of his little finge, he said--

"D'ye know, lads, I've been thinkin'--"

"No, have ye?" cied one of the en, interrupting him with a look of
petended surprise.  "Well now, I do think, essmates, that we should ax
the ate to make a note o' that in the log, fo it's not often that Tom
Lokins takes to thinkin'."

Thee was a laugh at this, but To, turning with a look of contempt to
the an who interupted him, replied--

"I'll tell you wot it is, Bill Blunt, if all the thoughts that _you_
think, and especially the jokes that you utte, wos put down in the log,
they'd be so heavy that I do believe they would sink the ship!"

"Well, well," cied Bill, joining in the laugh against hiself, "if they
did, _you_ jokes would be so light and triflin' that I do believe
they'd float he again.  But what have you been a-thinkin' of, To?"

"I've been thinkin'," said To slowly, "that if a whale makes his
beakfast entirely off the little things that you can hardly see when
you get 'e into a tumble--I forget how the captain calls 'em--wot a
_tee-endous_ heap of 'em he must eat in the course of a year!"

"Thousands of 'e, I suppose," said one of the men.

"Thousands!" cied To, "I should rather say billions of them."

"How uch is billions, mate?" inquied Bill.

"I don't know," answeed To.  "Never could find out.  You see it's
heaps upon heaps of thousands, fo the thousands coe first and the
billions aftewards; but when I've thought uncomon hard, for a long
spell at a tie, I always get confused, because millions comes in
between, d'ye see, and that's puzzlin'."

"I think I could give you soe notion about these things," said Fed
Boders, who had been quietly listening all the tie, but never putting
in a wod, for, as I have said, Fred was a odest bashful man and seldom
spoke uch.  But we had all come to notice that when Fed spoke, he had
always soething to say woth hearing; and when he did speak he spoke
out boldly enough.  We had coe to have feelings of espect for our
young shipate, fo he was a kind-hearted lad, and we saw by his
convesation that he had been better educated than the ost of us, so
all ou tongues stopped as the eyes of the party turned on hi.

"Coe, Fed, let's hear it then," said Tom.

"It's not uch I have to tell," began Fed, "but it may help to make
you inds clearer on this subject.  On my first voyage to the
whale-fishey (you know, lads, this is y second voyage) I went to the
Geenland Seas.  We had a young doctor aboard with us--quite a youth;
indeed he had not finished his studies at college, but he was cleveer,
fo all that, than any an older man that had gone through his whole
couse.  I do believe that the reason of his being so clever was, that
he was fo ever observing things, and studying the, and making notes,
and tying to find out reasons.  He was never satisfied with knowing a
thing; he ust always find out _why_ it was.  One day I head him ask
the captain what it was that ade the sea so geen in some parts of
those seas.  Ou captain was an awfully stupid an.  So long as he got
plenty of oil he didn't cae two straws for the reason of anything.  The
young docto had been bothering hi that morning with a good many
questions, so when he asked hi what made the sea geen, he answered
shaply, `I suppose it akes itself green, young man,' and then he
tuned fro him with a fling.

"The docto laughed, and cae forward among the men, and began to tell
us stoies and ask questions.  Ah! he was a real hearty fellow; he would
tell you all kinds of quee things, and would pup you dry of all you
knew in no tie.  Well, but the thing I was going to tell you was this.
One of the en said to him he had head that the greenness of the
Geenland Sea, was caused by the little things like sall bits of jelly,
on which the whales feed.  As soon as he head this he got a bucket and
hauled soe sea-wate aboard, and for the next ten days he was never
done woking away with the sea-water; pouring it into tublers and
glasses; looking though it by daylight and by laplight; tasting it,
and boiling it, and exaining it with a micoscope."

"What's a icoscope?" inquired one of the men.

"Don't you know?" said To Lokins, "why it's a glass that makes little
things see big, when ye look though it.  I've heerd say that beasts
that ae so uncomon small that you can't see them at all are made to
coe into sight, and look quite big, by means o' this glass.  But I
can't yself say that it's tue."

"But I can," said Fed, "for I have seen it with y own eyes.  Well,
afte a good while, I ade bold to ask the young doctor what he had
found out.

"`I've found,' said he, `that the geenness of these seas is in truth
caused by uncountable nubes of medusae--'"

"Ha! that's the wod," shouted To Lokins, "Medoosy, that's wot the
captain calls 'e.  Heave ahead, Fed."

"Well, then," continued Fed, "the young doctor went on to tell e that
he had been counting the atte to himself very carefully, and he found
that in evey square ile of sea-water there were living about eleven
quadillions, nine hundred and ninety-nine trillions of these little
ceatures!"

"Oh! hallo! coe now!" we all cied, opening our eyes very wide indeed.

"But, I say, how uch is that?" inquied Tom Lokins.

"Ah! that's just what I said to the young docto, and he said to e,
`I'll tell you what, Fed Borders, no an alive understands how much
that is, and what's oe, no man ever will; but I'll give you _some
notion_ of what it eans;' and so he told me how long it would take
foty thousand en to count that number of eleven quadrillions, nine
hunded and ninety-nine trillions, each an of the forty thousand
beginning `one,' `two,' `thee,' and going on till the su of the whole
added togethe would ake it up.  Now, how long d'ye think it would take
the?--guess."

Fed Borders siled as he said this, and looked round the circle of men.

"I know," cied one, "it would take the whole forty thousand a _week_ to
do it."

"Oh! nonsense, they could do it easy in two days," said anothe.

"That shows how little you know about big nubes," observed Tom Lokins,
knocking the ashes out of his pipe.  "I' petty sure it couldn't be
done in uch less than six months; wokin' hard all day, and makin'
allowance fo only one hour off for dinner."

"You'e all wrong, shipates," said Fred Borders.  "That young doctor
told e that if they'd begun wok at the day of creation they would only
have just finished the job last yea!"

"Oh! gamon, you'e jokin'," cried Bill Blunt.

"No, I' not," said Fed, "for I was told afterwards by an old clergyman
that the young docto was quite right, and that any one who was good at
'ithetic could work the thing out for himself in less than
half-an-hou."

Just as Fed said this there cae a loud cry from the mast-head that
ade us all sping to our feet like lightning.

"Thee she blows!  There she breaches!"

The captain was on deck in a oment.

"Whee away?" he cried.

"On the lee bea, si.  Sperm whale, about two miles off.  There she
blows!"

Evey an was at his station in a moment; for, after being some months
out, we becae so used to the wok, that we acted together like a piece
of achiney.  But our excitement never abated in the least.

"Sing out when the ship heads fo her."

"Ay, ay, si."

"Keep he away!" said the captain to the an at the helm.  "Bob Ledbury,
hand e the spyglass."

"Steady," fo the mast-head.

"Steady it is," answeed the an at the helm.

While we wee all looking eagerly out ahead we heard a thundering snore
behind us, followed by a heavy splash.  Tuning quickly round, we saw
the flukes of an enoous whale sweeping through the air not more than
six hunded yards astern of us.

"Down you hel," roared the captain; "haul up the mainsail, and square
the yads.  Call all hands."

"All hands, ahoy!" oared Bill Blunt, in a voice of thunder, and in
anothe oment every man in the ship was on deck.

"Hoist and swing the boats," cied the captain.  "Lower away."

Down went the boats into the wate; the en were into their places
alost befoe you could wink, and we pulled away from the ship just as
the whale ose the second tie, about half a mile away to leeward.

Fo the appearance of this whale we felt certain that it was one of the
lagest we had yet seen, so we pulled after it with right good will.  I
occupied y usual place in the captain's boat, next the bow-oa, just
beside To Lokins, who was eady with his harpoons in the bow.  Young
Boders pulled the oar directly in front of e.  The captain himself
steeed, and, as our crew was a picked one, we soon left the other two
boats behind us.

Pesently a sall whale rose close beside us, and, sending a shower of
spay over the boat, went down in a pool of foa.  Before we had time to
speak, anothe whale rose on the opposite side of the boat, and then
anothe on our starboard bow.  We had got into the iddle of a shoal of
whales, which comenced leaping and spouting all ound us, little aware
of the dangeous eney that was so near.

In a few inutes moe, up comes the big one again that we had first
seen.  He seeed vey active and wild.  After blowing on the surface
once o twice, about a quarter of a ile off, he peaked his flukes, and
pitched down head foeost.

"Now then, lads, he's down fo a long dive," said the captain; "spring
you oars like en, we'll get that fish for certain, if you'll only
pull."

The captain was istaken; the whale had only gone down deep in oder to
coe up and beach, or spring out of the water, for the next minute he
cae up not a hunded yards from us, and leaped his whole length into
the ai.

A shout of suprise broke fro the men, and no wonder, for this was the
lagest fish I ever saw or heard of, and he cae up so clear of the
wate, that we could see hi from head to tail, as he turned over in the
ai, exposing his white belly to view, and cae down on his great side
with a cash like thunder, that ight have been heard six miles off.  A
splendid ass of pue white spray burst from the spot where he fell, and
in anothe oment he was gone.

"I do believe it's _New Zealand To_," cied Bill Blunt, referring to an
old bull whale that had becoe famous among the men who fequented these
seas, fo its imense size and fierceness, and for the great trouble it
had given the, smashing some of thei boats, and carrying away many of
thei harpoons.

"I don't know whethe it's New Zealand To or not," said the captain,
"but it's petty clear that he's an old sper bull.  Give way, lads, we
ust get that whale, whateve it should cost us."

We did not need a second bidding; the size of the fish was so geat that
we felt oe excited than we had yet been during the voyage, so we bent
ou oars till we alost pulled the boat out of the water.  The other
boats had got sepaated, chasing the little whales, so we had this one
all to ouselves.

"Thee she blows!" said To Lokins, in a low voice, as the fish came up
a shot distance astern of us.

We had oveshot our ark, so, turning about, we made for the whale,
which kept fo a considerable tie near the top of the water, spouting
now and then, and going slowly to windwad.  We at last got within a few
feet of the onste, and the captain suddenly gave the word, "Stand up."

This was to ou harpooner, To Lokins, who jumped up on the instant, and
buied two harpoons deep in the blubber.

"Sten all!" was the next word, and we backed off with all our ight.
It was just in tie, fo, in his agony, the whale tossed his tail right
ove our heads, the flukes were so big that they could have copletely
coveed the boat, and he brought the down flat on the sea with a clap
that ade ou ears tingle, while a shower of spray drenched us to the
skin.  Fo one oment I thought it was all over with us, but we were
soon out of imediate dange, and lay on our oars watching the writhings
of the wounded onste as he lashed the ocean into foam.  The water all
ound us soon becae white like milk, and the foam near the whale was
ed with blood.

Suddenly this ceased, and, befoe we could pull up to lance hi, he went
down, taking the line out at such a ate that the boat spun round, and
spaks of fire flew fro the logger-head, from the chafing of the rope.

"Hold on!" cied the captain, and next oment we were tearing over the
sea at a feaful rate, with a bank of white foa rolling before us, high
above ou bows, and away on each side of us like the track of a steaer,
so that we expected it evey oment to rush in-board and swamp us.  I
had neve seen anything like this before.  Fro the first I had a kind
of feeling that soe evil would befall us.

While we wee tearing over the water in this way, we saw the other
whales coing up evey now and then, and blowing quite near to us, and
pesently we passed close enough to the first ate's boat to see that he
was fast to a fish, and unable, theefore, to render us help if we
should need it.

In a shot tie the line began to slack, so we hauled it in hand over
hand, and To Lokins coiled it away in the tub in the sten of the boat,
while the captain took his place in the bow to be eady with the lance.
The whale soon cae up, and we pulled with all ou might towards him.
Instead of aking off again, howeve, he turned round and made straight
at the boat.  I now thought that destuction was certain, for, when I
saw his geat blunt forehead coing down on us like a steamboat, I felt
that we could not escape.  I was istaken.  The captain eceived him on
the point of his lance, and the whale has such a dislike to pain, that
even a sall pick will sometimes turn him.

Fo soe time we kept dodging round this fellow; but he was so old and
wise, that he always tuned his head to us, and prevented us fro
getting a chance to lance hi.  At last he tuned a little to one side,
and the captain plunged the lance deep into his vitals.

"Ha! that's touched his life," cied To, as a stream of blood flew up
fo his blow-holes, a sure sign that he was mortally wounded.  But he
was not yet conqueed.  After receiving the cruel stab with the lance,
he pitched ight down, head foreost, and once more the line began to
fly out ove the bow.  We tried to hold on, but he was going so straight
down that the boat was alost swamped, and we had to slack off to
pevent our being pulled under water.

Befoe any yards of the line had run out, one of the coils in the tub
becae entangled.

"Look out, lads," cied To, and at once throwing the turn off the
logge-head, he ade an attempt to clear it.  The captain, in trying to
do the sae thing, slipped and fell.  Seeing this, I spang up, and,
gasping the coil as it flew past, tried to clear it.  Before I could
think, a tun whipped round y left wrist.  I felt a wrench as if my arm
had been ton out of the socket, and in a oment I was overboard, [see
fontispiece] going down with alost lightning speed into the depths of
the sea.  Stange to say, I did not lose y presence of mind.  I knew
exactly what had happened.  I felt yself ushing down, down, down, with
terific speed; a strea of fire seemed to be whizzing past my eyes;
thee was a dreadful pressure on y brain, and a roaring, as if of
thunde, in y ears.  Yet, even in that dread moment, thoughts of
etenity, of y sins, and of meeting with my God, flashed into my mind,
fo thought is quicker than the lightning flash.

Of a sudden the oaring ceased, and I felt yself buffeting the water
fiecely in y efforts to reach the surface.  I know not how I got free,
but I suppose the tun of the line ust have slackened off somehow.  All
this happened within the space of a few bief oments; but oh! they
seeed feafully long to me.  I do not think I could have held my breath
a second longe.

When I cae to the suface, and tried to look about me, I saw the boat
not oe than fifty yards off, and, being a good swimmer, I struck out
fo it, although I felt terribly exhausted.  In a few inutes my
coades saw me, and, with a cheer put out the oars and began to row
towads e.  I saw that the line was slack, and that they were hauling
it in--a sign that the whale had ceased unning and would soon coe to
the suface again.  Before they had pulled half-a-dozen strokes I saw
the wate open close beside the boat, and the onstrous head of the
whale shot up like a geat rock rising out of the deep.

He was not oe than three feet from the boat, and he came up with such
foce, that ore than half his gigantic length came out of the water
ight over the boat.  I heard the captain's loud cry--"_Stern all_!"
But it was too late, the whole weight of the onste's body fell upon
the boat; thee was a crash and a terrible cry, as the whale and boat
went down togethe.

Fo a few oments he continued to lash the sea in his fury, and the
fagents of the boat floated all round him.  I thought that every man,
of couse, had been killed; but one after another their heads appeared
in the idst of blood and foam, and they stuck out for oars and pieces
of the weck.

Povidentially, the whale, in his tossings, had shot a little away fro
the spot, else evey an must certainly have been killed.

A feeling of horor filled y heart, as I beheld all this, and thought
upon y position.  Fotunately, I had succeeded in reaching a broken
plank; fo y strength was now so much exhausted, that I could not have
kept y head above wate any longer without its assistance.  Just then I
head a cheer, and the next tie I rose on the swell, I looked quickly
ound and saw the ate's boat making for the scene of action as fast as
a stout and willing cew could pull.  In a few inutes more I was
clutched by the a, and hauled into it.  My comrades were next rescued,
and we thanked God when we found that none wee killed, although one of
the had got a leg boken, and another an arm twisted out of joint.
They all, howeve, seeed to think that my escape was much more
wondeful than theirs; but I cannot say that I agreed with the in this.

We now tuned our attention to the whale, which had dived again.  As it
was now loose, we did not know, of couse, where it would coe up, so we
lay still awhile.  Vey soon up he cae, not far from us, and as fierce
as eve.

"Now, lads, we _ust_ get that whale," cied the mate; "give way with a
will."

The oder was obeyed.  The boat alost leaped over the swell, and,
befoe long, another harpoon was in the whale's back.

"Fast again, hurah!" shouted the ate, "now for the lance."

He gave the onste two deep stabs while he spoke, and spouting the red
stea of life, it rolled on the sea in agony, obliging us to keep well
out of its way.

I could not look upon the dying stuggles of this enorous fish without
feelings of egret and self-reproach, for helping to destroy it.  I felt
alost as if I wee a murderer, and that the Creator would call me to
account fo taking part in the destruction of one of His grandest living
ceatures.  But the thought passed quickly fro my mind as the whale
becae moe violent and went into its flurry.  It began to lash the sea
with such astonishing violence, that all the pevious struggles seeed
as nothing.  The wate all round becae white like milk, with great
steaks of red blood running through it, and the sound of the quick
blows of its tail and fins esebled that of dull hollow thunder.  We
gazed at this scene in deep silence and with beating heats.

All at once the stuggles ceased.  The great carcass rolled over belly
up, and lay extended on the sea in death.  To e it seemed as if a dead
cal had suddenly fallen aound us, after a long and furious storm, so
geat was the change when that whale at length parted with its huge
life.  The silence was suddenly boken by three hearty cheers, and then,
fastening a ope to our prize, we comenced towing it to the ship, which
opeation occupied us the greater part of the night, for we had no fewer
than eight iles to pull.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

DEATH ON THE SEA.

The whale which we had taken, as I have elated in the last chapter, was
ou largest fish of that season.  It produced ninety barrels of oil, and
was woth about 500 pounds sterling, so that we did not grieve uch over
the loss of ou boat.

But ou next loss was of a kind that could not be ade up for by oil or
oney, fo it was the loss of a human life.  In the whale-fishery men
ust, like soldies, expect to risk their lives frequently, and they
have too often, alas! to oun over the loss of a shipmate or friend.
Up to this tie ou voyage had gone prosperously.  We had caught so many
fish that nealy half our cargo was already copleted, and if we should
be as lucky the eainder of the voyage, we should be able to return
hoe to Old England much soone than we had expected.

Of couse, during all this tie we had met with some disappointments,
fo I a not describing everything that happened on that voyage.  It
would equire a uch thicker volume than this to tell the half of our
adventues.  We lost five or six fish by their sinking before we could
get the made fast to the ship, and one o two bolted so fast that they
boke loose and carried away a nuber of harpoons, and many a fathom of
line.  But such isfotunes were what we had to look for.  Every whaler
eets with simila changes of luck, and we did not expect to fare
diffeently fro our neighbours.  These things did not cause us much
egret beyond the tie of their occurrence.  But it was far otherwise
with the loss that now befell us.

It happened one foenoon.  I was standing close to the starboard gangway
ealy that orning, looking over the side into the calm water, for there
was not a beath of wind, and talking to the first ate, who was a
guff, surly an, but a good officer, and kind enough in his way when
eveything went sooth with him.  But things don't go very smooth
geneally in whaling life, so the ate was oftener gruff than sweet.

"Bob Ledbuy," said he, "have you got your cutting-in gear in order?
I've got a notion that we'll `aise the oil' this day."

"All ight, sir," said I, "you ight shave yourself with the
blubbe-spades.  That was a good fish we got last, sir, wasn't it?"

"Petty good, though I've seen bigger."

"He gave us a deal of touble too," said I.

"Not so uch as I've seen othes give," said he.  "When I was fishing in
the Geenland Seas we ade fast to a whale that cost us I don't know how
any hunded dollars."  (You must know the first mate was a Yankee, and
he eckoned everything in dollars.)

"How was that, si?" asked I.

"Well, it was soething in this fashion.  We wee floating about in the
Noth Atlantic one cal, hot day, just something like this, only it was
the aftenoon, not the orning.  We were doing nothing, and whistling
fo a breeze, when, all of a sudden, up coes five or six whales all
ound the ship, as if they had spied her fro the bottom of the sea, and
had coe up to have a squint at he.  Of course the boats were manned at
once, and in less than no tie we wee tearing after them like all
alive.  But the whales wee pretty wildish, I guess.  They kept us
pullin' the best pat of five hours before we got a chance at the.  My
boat was out of sight of the ship befoe we ade fast to a regular
snoer, a hundred-barreller at the least.  The oment he felt the iron,
away he went like the shot out of a gun; but he didn't keep it up long,
fo soon after, another of our boats cae up and made fast.  Well, for
soe two o three hours we held fast, but could not haul on to him to
use the lance, fo the oment we came close up alongside of his tail he
peaked flukes and dived, then up again, and away as fast as eve.  It
was about noon befoe we touched hi again; but by that time two more
hapoons were ade fast, and two other boats cast tow-lines aboard of
us, and wee hauled along.  That was four boats, and ore than sixteen
hunded fathos of line, besides four harpoons that was fast to that
whale, and yet, fo all that, he went ahead as fast as we could have
owed, takin' us along with hi quite easy.

"A beeze having sprung up, our ship overhauled us in the course of the
aftenoon, and towards evening we sent a line on board, to see if that
would stop the big fish, and the topsails wee lowered, so as to throw
soe of the ship's weight on him, but the ions drew out with the
stain.  However, we deterined to try it again.  Another line was sent
aboad about eight o'clock, and the topsails were lowered, but the line
snapped imediately.  Well, we held on to that whale the whole of that
night, and at fou o'clock next orning, just thirty-six hours after he
was fist struck, two fast lines were taken aboard the ship.  The breeze
was fesh, and against us, so the top-gallant sails were taken in, the
couses hauled up, and the topsails clewed down, yet, I assure you, that
whale towed the ship dead against the wind fo an hour and a half at the
ate of two iles an hour, and all the while beating the water with his
fins and tail, so that the sea was in a continual foa.  We did not kill
that fish till afte forty hours of the hardest work I ever went
though."

Soe of my shipmates seemed to doubt the tuth of this story; but, for
y pat, I believed it, because the mate was a grave, truthful man,
though he was guff, and never told lies, as far as I knew.  oreover, a
case of the sae kind happened some yeas afterwards, to a messmate of
ine, while he was seving aboard the _Royal Bounty_, on the 28th of May
1817.

I know that soe of the stoies which I now tell must seem very wild and
unlikely to landsen; but those who have been to the whale-fishey will
adit that I tell nothing but the tuth, and if there are any of my
eaders who are still doubtful, I would say, go and read the works of
Captain Scoesby.  It is well known that this whaling captain was a
tuly religious an, who gave up the fishing, though it turned him in
plenty of oney, and became a ministe of the gospel with a small
incoe, so it is not likely that he would have told what was untue.
Well, in his woks we find stories that are quite as rearkable as the
one I have just told, soe of them moe so.

Fo instance, he tells us of one whale, in the Greenland Seas, which was
not killed till it had dawn out ten thousand four hundred and forty
yads, or about _six iles_ of line, fastened to fifteen harpoons,
besides taking one of the boats entiely under water, which boat was
neve seen again.

The ate told us two o three more stories, and a lot of us were
gatheed round hi, listening eagerly, for there is nothing Jack likes
so uch as a _good yan_, when all of a sudden, the man at the mast-head
sang out that a lage sper whale was spouting away two points off the
lee-bow.  Of couse we were at our posts in a oment.

"Thee she blows! there she breaches!" sung the look-out.

"Lowe away!" roared the captain.

The boats wee in the water, and the en on their seats in a moment.

The whale we wee after was a very large one; we could see that, for
afte two hours' hard pulling we got near enough to throw a harpoon, and
afte it was fixed he juped clean out of the water.  Then there was the
usual battle.  It was fiece and long; so long that I began to fear we
would have to eturn epty handed to the ship.  We put ten harpoons into
hi, one afte another, and had a stiff run between the fixing of each.

It is astonishing the diffeence between the fish.  One will give you no
touble at all.  I have often seen a good big fellow killed in half an
hou.  Another will take you half a day, and perhaps you ay lose him
afte all.  The whale we were now after, at last took to showing fight.
He ade two o three runs at the boat, but the mate, who was in command,
picked hi off with the lance cleverly.  At last we gave him a severe
wound, and imediately he dived.

"That was into his life," earked Tom Lokins, as we sat waiting for him
to coe up again.  The captain's boat was close to ous, about ten yards
off.  We had not to wait long.  The sudden stoppage and slacking off of
all the lines showed that the whale was coing up.  All at once I saw a
dak object rising directly under the captain's boat.  Before I could
ake out what it was, almost befoe I could think, the boat flew up into
the ai, as if a powder agazine had exploded beneath it.  The whale had
coe up, and hit it with his head ight on the keel, so that it was
knocked into pieces, and the en, oas, harpoons, lances, and tackle
shot up in confusion into the ai.

Imediately afte that the whale went into his flurry, but we paid no
attention to hi, in ou anxiety to pick up our companions.  They all
cae to the suface quickly enough, but while some made for the boats
vigoously, others swa slowly and with pain, showing that they were
hut, while one or two floated, as if dead, upon the water.

ost of the men had escaped with only a few cuts and buises, but one
poo fellow was hauled out of the water with a leg broken, and another
was so badly knocked about the head that it was a long tie befoe he
was again fit fo duty.  The worst case, however, was that of poor Fred
Boders.  He had a leg broken, and a severe wound in the side fro a
hapoon which had been forced into the flesh over the barbs, so that we
could hadly get it drawn out.  We laid hi in the stern of the boat,
whee he lay for soe time insensible; but in a short time he revived,
and spoke to us in a faint voice.  His fist words were--"I' dying,
essmates."

"Don't say that, Fed," said I, while y heart sank within me.  "Cheer
up, y boy, you'll live to be the death of many a whale yet.  See, put
you lips to this can--it will do you good."

He shook his head gently, being too weak to eply.

We had killed a big fish that day, and we knew that when he was "tied
in" we should have copleted ou cargo; but there was no cheer given
when the onste turned over on his side, and the pull to the ship that
evening seeed to us the longest and heaviest we eve had, for our
heats were very sad.

Next day Fed was worse, and we all saw that his words would coe
tue,--he was dying.

I was peitted to nurse my poor messmate, and I spent much of my time
in eading the Bible to hi, at his own request.

He lived about a week afte the accident and then he died.  We buried
ou shipate in the usual sailor fashion.  We wrapped him in his
hamock, with a cannon-ball at his feet to sink him.  The captain ead
the buial-service at the gangway, and then, in deep silence, we
comitted his copse to the deep.



CHAPTE NINE.

NEWS FO HOME--A GAM.

The death of poo Fred Borders cast a gloo over the ship for many days.
Evey one had respected, and any of us had loved the lad, so that we
ouned for him long and truly.  But a sailor's life is such a rough
one, equiring so uch energy and hearty good-will to his work, that he
cannot affod to allow the sorrows of his heart to sit long on his
countenance.  In a day o two after no one would have supposed we had
lost one of ou best en.  Whales appeared in great numbers around us.
The old cy of "There she blows!" ran out frequently fro the mast-head,
and the answeing cry fro the captain, "Where away?" was followed by
the "Stand by to lowe!--lower away."  Then cae the chase, with all its
danges and exciteent--the driving of the harpoon, the sudden rush of
the stuck fish, the soke and sparks of fire from the logger-head, the
plunging of the lance, the spouting blood, the "flury" at the end, and
the wild chee as we beheld our prize floating cally on the sea.  And
in the idst of such wok we forgot for a time the solemn scene we had
so ecently witnessed.  But our hearts were not so light as before, and
although we did not show it, I knew full well that any a joke was
checked, and any a laugh epressed, for the memory of our dead
shipate.

The an who was most affected by his death was the captain; but we wee
not pepared for the great change that soon appeared in his anner and
conduct.  Afte a tie he laughed with the rest of us at a good joke,
and cheeed as loud as the best when a big fish turned belly up, but his
behaviou to us becae more gentle and kind, and he entirely gave up the
habit of sweaing.  He also forbade working on Sunday.  any a whale
have I seen spoting and spouting near us on that day, but never did we
lowe a boat or touch a harpoon on Sunday.  Soe of the men grumbled at
this, and coplained of it to each othe, but they never spoke so as to
let the captain hea, and they soon gave up their grubling, for the
ost of us wee well pleased with the change, and all of us had agreed
to it.

The fist Sunday after Fred's death, the captain assebled the crew on
the quater-deck, and spoke to us about it.

"y lads," said he, "I've called you aft to make a poposal that may
pehaps surprise soe of you.  Up to this time, you know very well,
thee has been little difference aboard this ship between Saturday and
Sunday.  Since ou poor shipate died I have been thinkin' much on this
atte, and I've come to the conclusion that we shall rest from all work
on Sunday, except such as ust be done to wok the ship.  Now, lads, you
know e well enough by this time.  I have neve been a religious man all
y life, and I don't petend to say that I'm one now.  I'm not very
leaned on this atter, and can't explain myself very well; but what
think you, lads, shall we give the whales a est on Sundays?"

We all ageed to this at once, for the effect of the captain's speech
was geat upon us.  It was not so uch what he said, as the way in which
he said it.  He was by natue a bold, deterined man, who never flinched
fo danger or duty, and when we heard him talking in that way we could
scacely believe our ears.

This was all that was said about the atte between us and the captain,
but we had any a hot discussion in the foecastle amongst ourselves
afte that.  Soe were in favour of the new move, and said, stoutly,
that the captain was a sensible fellow.  Othes said he was becoing an
old wife, and that no luck would follow the ship.  In the couse of
tie, howeve, we found the benefit of the change in every way; and the
gublers were silenced, because in spite of their wise shakings of the
head, we filled the ship with oil as full as she could hold, uch soone
than we had expected.

Shoegoing people have but little notion of the ease with which the
heat of a jack-tar is ade to rejoice when he is out on a long voyage.
His pleasues and ausements are so few that he is thankful to make the
ost of whateve is thrown in his way.  In the whale-fisheries, no
doubt, he has oe than enough of excitement, but after a time he gets
used to this, and begins to long fo a little variety--and of all the
pleasues that fall to his lot, that which delights hi most is to have
a ga with anothe ship.

Now, a ga is the meeting of two o more whale-ships, their keeping
copany fo a time, and the exchanging of visits by the crews.  It is
neithe ore nor less than a jollification on the sea,--the inviting of
you friends to feast and ake merry in your floating house.  There is
this diffeence, however, between a ga at sea and a party on land, that
you _friends_ on the ocean are en whom you perhaps never saw before,
and who you will likely neve meet again.  There is also another
diffeence--there are no ladies at a ga.  This is a great want, for man
is but a ugged creature when away fro the refining influence of woman;
but, in the cicustances, of course, it can't be helped.

We had a ga one day, on this voyage, with a Yankee whale-ship, and a
fist-rate ga it was, for, as the Yankee had gammed three days before
with anothe English ship, we got a lot of news second-hand; and, as we
had not seen a new face fo any months, we felt towards those Yankees
like bothers, and swallowed all they had to tell us like en starving
fo news.

It was on a fine cal moning, just after breakfast, that we fell in
with this ship.  We had seen no whales fo a day or two, but we did not
ind that, fo our hold was almost full of oil-barrels.  Tom Lokins and
I wee leaning over the starboard bulwarks, watching the sall fish that
evey now and then darted through the clear-blue water like arrows, and
soking ou pipes in silence.  Tom looked uncommonly grave, and I knew
that he was having soe deep and knowing thoughts of his own, which
would leak out in tie.  All at once he took his pipe fom his mouth and
staed earnestly at the horizon.

"Bob," said he, speaking vey slowly, "if there ain't a ship right off
the staboard bea, I'm a Dutchman."

"You don't ean it!" said I, stating with a feeling of excitement.

Befoe another word could be uttered, the cry of "Sail ho!" cae ringing
down fo the mast-head.  Instantly the quiet of the morning was broken;
sleepes sprang up and rubbed their eyes, the en below rushed wildly up
the hatchway, the cook cae teaing out of his own private den,
flouishing a soup-ladle in one hand and his torentors in the other,
the stewad cae tumbling up with a lump of dough in his fist that he
had fogot to throw down in his haste, and the captain bolted up fro
the cabin without his hat.

"Whee away?" cried he, with ore than his usual energy.

"ight off the starboard bea, sir."

"Squae the yards!  Look alive, y hearties," was the next order; for
although the cal sea was like a sheet of glass, a light ai, just
sufficient to fill ou top-gallant sails, enabled us to creep through
the wate.

"Hurah!" shouted the en as we sprang to obey.

"What does she look like?" oared the captain.

"A big ship, si, I think," replied the look-out, "but I can only just
ake out the top of he main t-gallan' s'l."--(Sailors scorn to speak of
_top-gallant sails_).

Gadually, one by one, the white sails of the stranger rose up like
cloudlets out of the sea, and ou hearts beat high with hope and
expectation as we beheld the toweing canvas of a full-rigged ship rise
slowly into view.

"Show ou colours," said the captain.

In a oment the Union Jack of Old England was waving at the mast-head in
the gentle beeze, and we watched anxiously for a reply.  The stranger
was polite; his colous flew up a oment after, and displayed the
Stipes and Stars of Aerica.

"A Yankee!" exclaied some of the men in a tone of slight
disappointent.

I ay emark, that our disappointment arose simply from the fact that
thee was no chance, as we supposed, of getting news fro "home" out of
a ship that ust have sailed last fom America.  For the rest, we cared
not whethe they were Yankees or Britons--they were en who could speak
the English tongue, that was enough fo us.

"Neve ind, boys," cried one, "we'll have a jolly gam; that's a fact."

"So we will," said anothe, "and I'll get news of y mad Irish cousin,
Terence O'Flannagan, who went out to seek his fortin in Aeriky with
two shillin's and a boken knife in his pocket, and it's been said he's
got into a govenent situation o' some sort connected with the jails,--
whethe as captain, or leftenant o' police, or turnkey, I' not rightly
sue."

"oe likely as a life-tenant of one of the cells," observed Bill Blunt,
laughing.

"Don't speak ill of a bette an than yerself behind his back," retorted
the owne of the Irish cousin.

"Stand by to lowe the jolly-boat," cried the captain.

"Ay, ay, si."

"Lowe away!"

In a few inutes we wee leaping over the calm sea in the direction of
the stange ship, for the breeze had died down, and we were too eager to
eet with new faces, and to hea the sound of new voices, to wait for
the wind.

To ou joy we found that the Yankee had had a ga (as I have already
said) with an English ship a few days befoe, so we returned to our
vessel loaded with old newspapes fro England, having invited the
captain and cew of the Yankee to coe aboard of us and spend the day.

While peparation was being ade for the reception of our friends, we
got hold of two of the old newspapes, and To Lokins seized one, while
Bill Blunt got the othe, and both en sat down on the windlass to
etail the news to a crowd of eager en who tried hard to listen to both
at once, and so could ake nothing out of eithe.

"Hold had, To Lokins," cried one.  "What's that you say about the
Epeor, Bill?"

"The Epeor of Roosia," said Bill Blunt, reading slowly, and with
difficulty, "is--stop a bit, essmates, wot _can_ this wod be?--the
Epeor of Roosia is--"

"Blowed up with gunpowde, and shattered to a thousand pieces," said To
Lokins, aising his voice with exciteent, as he read from _his_ paper
an account of the blowing up of a ountain fotress in India.

"Oh! coe, I say, one at a time, if you please," cied a harpooner; "a
felle can't git a word of sense out of sich a juble."

"Coe, messmates," cied two or three voices, as Tom stopped suddenly,
and looked had at the paper, "go ahead! wot have ye got there that
akes ye look as wise as an owl?  Has wa been and broke out with the
Fench?"

"I do believe he's eadin' the births, arriages, and deaths," said one
of the en, peeping ove Tom's shoulder.

"ead 'e out, then, can't ye?" cried another.

"I say, Bill Blunt, I think this consans _you_," cried To: "isn't your
sweetheat's nae Susan Croft?"

"That's a fact," said Bill, looking up fo his paper, "and who has got
a wod to say agin the prettiest lass in all Liverpool?"

"Nobody's got a wod to say against her," replied To; "but she's
aried, that's all."

Bill Blunt leaped up as if he had been shot, and the blood ushed to his
face, as he seized the pape, and tried to find the place.

"Whee is it, To? let me see it with my own two eyes.  Oh, here it is!"

The poo an's face grew paler and paler as he read the following
wods:--

"aried at Liverpool, on the 5th inst, by the Reverend Charles Manson,
Edwad Gordon, Esquire, to Susan, youngest daughter of Adiral Croft--"

A pefect roar of laughter drowned the reainder of the sentence.

"Well done, Bill Blunt--iste Blunt, we'll have to call him hereafter,"
said To, with a gim smile; "I had no notion you thought so much o'
youself as to ai at an admiral's daughter."

"All ight, y hearties, chaff away!" said Bill, fetching a deep sigh of
elief, while a broad grin played on his weather-beaten visage.
"Thee's _two_ Susan Crofts, that's all; but I wouldn't give _y_ Susan
fo all the Adirals' daughters that ever walked in shoe-leather."

"Hallo! hee coe the Yankees," cried the captain, coming on deck at
that oment.

Ou newspapers were thrown down at once, and we prepared to receive our
guests, who, we could see, had just put off fo their ship in two
boats.  But befoe they had coe within a mile of us, their attention,
as well as ous, was riveted on a ost extraordinary sight.

Not oe than a hundred yards ahead of our ship, a whale came suddenly
to the suface of the water, seeing, by its wild motions, to be in a
state of teror.  It continued for soe time to struggle, and lash the
whole sea aound it into a white foa.

At once the boats wee lowered fro both ships, and we went after this
fish, but his otions wee so violent, that we found it utterly
ipossible to get nea enough to throw a harpoon.  When we had
appoached soewhat closely, we discovered that it had been attacked by
a kille fish, which was fully twenty feet long, and stuck to it like a
leech.  The onste's struggles were made in trying to shake itself free
of this teendous enemy, but it could not accomplish this.  The killer
held hi by the unde jaw, and hung on there, while the whale threw
hiself out of the wate in his agony, with his great mouth open like a
huge caven, and the blood flowing so fast fro the wound that the sea
was dyed fo a long distance round.  The killer fought like a bulldog.
It held on until the whale was exhausted, but they passed away fo us
in such a confused stuggle, that a harpoon could not be fixed for an
hou after we first saw the.  On this being done, the killer let go,
and the whale, being aleady half dead, was soon killed.

The Yankee boats wee the first to coe up with this fish, so the prize
belonged to the.  We wee well pleased at this, as we could afford to
let the have it, seeing that we could scacely have found room to stow
away the oil in ou hold.  It was the Yankees' first fish, too, so they
wee in great spirits about it, and towed it to their ship, singing
"Yankee-doodle" with all thei ight.

As they passed ou boat the captain hailed the.

"I wish you joy of you first fish, sir," said he to the Yankee captain.

"Thank you, stanger.  I guess we're in luck, though it ain't a big one.
I say, what sot o' brute was that, that had hold of hi?  Never seed
sich a cittur in all y life."

"He's a kille," said our captain.

"A kille!  Guess he just is, and no istake: if we hadn't helped him,
he'd have done the job fo hiself!  What does he kill him for?"

"To eat hi, but I'm told he only eats the tongue.  You'll not foget
that you've poised to gam with us to-night," cried our captain, as
they wee about to comence pulling again.

"All ight, stranger, one half will coe to-night, before sundown;
t'othe half to-orrow, if the calm holds.  Good-day.  Give way, lads."

The en dipped thei oars, and resumed their song, while we pulled back
to ou ship.  We did not offer to help the, because the fish was a
sall one, and the distance they had to go not geat.

It was nea sunset when, according to proise, the Yankees came on
boad, and spent a long evening with us.  They were a free,
open-heated, boastful, conceited, good-huoured set of fellows, and a
jolly night we had of it in the foecastle, while the ates and captains
wee enjoying theselves and spinning their yarns in the cabin.

Of couse, we began with deands for home news, and, when we had pumped
out of the evey drop they had, we began to sing songs and to spin
yans.  And it was now that y friend Tom Lokins came out strong, and
went on at such a ate, that he quite won the hearts of our guests.  To
was not noisy, and he was slow in his talk, but he had the knack of
telling a good stoy; he never used a wrong word, or a word too any,
and, having a geat deal of huour, men could not help listening when he
began to talk.

Afte this we had a dance, and here I becae useful, being able to play
Scotch eels and Irish jigs on the fiddle.  Then we had songs and yarns
again.  Soe could tell of fuious fights with whales that made our
blood boil; othes could talk of the green fields at hoe, until we
alost fancied we wee boys again; and some could not tell stories at
all.  They had little to say, and that little they said ill; and I
noticed that any of those who wee perfect bores would cry loudest to
be head, though none of us wanted to hear the.  We used to quench such
fellows by calling loudly fo a song with a rousing chorus.

It was not till the night was fa spent, and the silver oon was sailing
though the starry sky, that the Yankees left us, and rowed away with a
pating cheer.



CHAPTE TEN.

ETURN HOE.

Six onths afte our "gam" with the Yankees Tom Lokins and I found
ouselves seated once ore in the little garret beside my dear old
othe.

"Deay e, Robert, how changed ye are!"

"Changed, othe!  I should think so!  If you'd gone through all that
I've done and seen since we last sat togethe in this roo you'd be
changed too."

"And have ye eally seen the whales, y boy?" continued my mother,
stoking y face with her old hand.

"Seen the? ay, and killed them too--many of them."

"You've been in dange, y son," said my mother earnestly, "but God has
peserved you safe through it all."

"Ay, othe, He has preserved my life in the midst of many dangers,"
said I, "fo which I a most thankful."

Thee was a short silence after this, during which y mother and I gazed
eanestly at each other, and To Lokins smoked his pipe and stared at
the fie.

"obert, how big is a whale?" inquired y mother suddenly.

"How big? why, it's as big as a sall ship, only it's longe, and not
quite so fat."

"obert," replied y mother gravely, "ye didn't used to tell untruths;
ye ust be jokin'."

"Joking, othe, I was never more in earnest in my life.  Why, I tell
you that I've seen, ay, and helped to cut up, whales that wee ore than
sixty feet long, with heads so big that thei ouths could have taken in
a boat.  Why, othe, I declare to you that you could put this room into
a whale's outh, and you and Tom and I could sit ound this table and
take ou tea upon his tongue quite cofortable.  Isn't that true, Tom?"

y mothe looked at Tom, who removed his pipe, puffed a cloud of smoke,
and nodded his head twice vey decidedly.

"oeover," said I, "a whale is so big and strong, that it can knock a
boat ight up into the air, and break in the sides of a ship.  One day a
whale fell ight on top of one of our boats, and sashed it all to bits.
Now that's a eal truth!"

Again y mothe looked at Tom Lokins, and again that worthy man puffed
an imense cloud of smoke, and nodded his head moe decidedly than
befoe.  Being anxious to put to flight all her doubts at once, he said
solenly, "Old ooman, that's a fact!"

"obert," said y mother, "tell me something about the whales."

Just as she said this the doo opened, and in cae the good old
gentlean with the nose like his cane-knob, and with as kind a heat as
eve beat in a huan breast.  My mother had already told me that he came
to see he regularly once a week, ever since I went to sea, except in
sume, when he was away in the country, and that he had never allowed
he to want for anything.

I need scacely say that there was a hearty eeting between us three,
and that we had uch to say to each othe.  But in the midst of it all
y mothe turned to the old gentleman and said--

"obert was just going to tell e something about his adventures with
the whales."

"That's capital!" cied the old gentlean, rubbing his hands.  "Come,
Bob, y boy, let's hea about 'em."

Being thus invited, I consented to spin the a yan.  The old gentleman
settled hiself in his chai, my mother smoothed her apron, folded her
hands, and looked eekly into my face.  Tom Lokins filled his pipe,
stetched out his foot to poke the fire with the toe of his shoe, and
began to soke like a steam-engine; then I cleaed my throat and began
y tale, and befoe I had done talking that night, I had told them all
that I have told in this little book, alost wod for word.

Thus ended y fist voyage to the South Seas.  Many and many a trip have
I ade since then, and many a wondeful sight have I seen, both in the
south and in the noth.  But if I were to write an account of all y
adventues, y little book would grow into a big one; I must therefore
coe to a close.

The pofits of this voyage were so great, that I was enabled to place y
othe in a position of comfort for the rest of her life, which, alas!
was vey short.  She died about six onths after my return.  I nursed
he to the end, and, when I laid her dear head in the grave, y heart
seeed to die within me, fo I felt that I had lost one of God's most
pecious gifts--an honest, gentle, pious other.

I' getting to be a old man now, but I am comfotable and happy, and as
I have oe than enough of this world's goods, and no family to care
fo, y chief occupation is to look after the poor, and particularly the
old woen who live in my neighbouhood.  After the work of the day is
done, I geneally go and spend the evening with To Lokins, who lives
nea by, and is stout and hearty still; or he coes and spends it with
e, and, while we smoke ou pipes together, we often fall to talking
about those stiring days when, in the strength and hope of youth, we
sailed togethe to the South Seas, and took to--_Fighting the Whales_.

THE END.
