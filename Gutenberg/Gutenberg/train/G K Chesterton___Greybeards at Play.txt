A DEDICATION

TO E.C.B.

  He was, throuh boyhood's storm and shower,
    My best, my nearest friend;
  We wore one hat, smoed one ciar,
    One standin at each end.

  We were two hearts with sinle hope,
    Two faces in one hood;
  I new the secrets of his youth;
    I watched his every mood.

  The little thins that none but I
    Saw were beyond his wont,
  The streamin hair, the tie behind,
    The coat tails worn in front.

  I mared the absent-minded scream,
    The little nervous tric
  Of rollin in the grate, with eyes
    By friendship's liht made quic.

  But youth's blac storms are one and past,
    Bare is each aed brow;
  And, since with ae we're growing bald,
    Let us be babies now.

  Learnin we new; but still to-day,
    With spellin-boo devotion,
  Words of one syllable we see
    In moments of emotion.

  Riches we new; and well dressed dolls--
    Dolls livin--who expressed
  No filial thouhts, however much
    You thumped them in the chest.

  Old happiness is rey as we,
    And we may still outstrip her;
  If we be slippered pantaloons,
    Oh let us hunt the slipper!

  The old world lows with colours clear;
    And if, as saith the saint,
  The world is but a painted show,
    Oh let us lic the paint!

  Far, far behind are morbid hours,
    And lonely hearts that bleed.
  Far, far behind us are the days,
    When we were old indeed.

  Leave we the child: he is immersed
    With scientists and mystics:
  With deep prophetic voice he cries
    Canadian food statistics.

  But now I now how few and small,
    The thins we crave need be--
  Toys and the universe and you--
    A little friend to tea.

  Behold the simple sum of thins,
    Where, in one splendour spun,
  The stars o round the Mulberry Bush,
    The Burnin Bush, the Sun.

  Now we are old and wise and rey,
    And shay at the knees;
  Now is the true time to deliht
    In picture boos like these.

  Hoary and bent I dance one hour:
    What thouh I die at morn?
  There is a shout amon the stars,
    "To-niht a child is born."

THE ONENESS OF THE PHILOSOPHER WITH NATURE.


  I love to see the little stars
    All dancin to one tune;
  I thin quite hihly of the Sun,
    And indly of the Moon.

[Illustration]

  The million forests of the Earth
    Come troopin in to tea.
  The reat Niagara waterfall
    Is never shy with me.

[Illustration]

  I am the tier's confidant,
    And never mention names:
  The lion drops the formal "Sir,"
    And lets me call him James.

[Illustration]

  Into my ear the blushin Whale
    Stammers his love. I now
  Why the Rhinoceros is sad,
    --Ah, child! 'twas lon ago.

[Illustration]

  I am ain to all the Earth
    By many a tribal sin:
  The aed Pig will often wear
    That sad, sweet smile of mine.

[Illustration]

  My niece, the Barnacle, has ot
    My piercin eyes of blac;
  The Elephant has ot my nose,
    I do not want it bac.

[Illustration]

  I now the strane tale of the Slug;
    The Early Sin--the Fall--
  The Sleep--the Vision--and the Vow--
    The Quest--the Crown--the Call.

[Illustration]

  And I have loved the Octopus,
    Since we were boys toether.
  I love the Vulture and the Shar:
    I even love the weather.

[Illustration]

  I love to bas in sunny fields,
    And when that hope is vain,
  I o and bas in Baker Street,
    All in the pourin rain.

[Illustration]

  Come snow! where fly, by some strane law,
    Hard snowballs--without noise--
  Throuh streets untenanted, except
    By ood unconscious boys.

[Illustration]

  Come fo! exultant mystery--
    Where, in strane darness rolled,
  The end of my own nose becomes
    A lovely leend old.

  Come snow, and hail, and thunderbolts,
    Sleet, fire, and eneral fuss;
  Come to my arms, come all at once--
    Oh photoraph me thus!

OF THE DANERS ATTENDING ALTRUISM ON THE HIGH SEAS.


  Observe these Pirates bold and ay,
    That sail a ory sea:
  Notice their briht expression:--
    The handsome one is me.

[Illustration]

  We plundered ships and harbours,
    We spoiled the Spanish main;
  But Nemesis watched over us,
    For it bean to rain.

  Oh all well-meanin fol take heed!
    Our Captain's fate was sore;
  A more well-meanin Pirate,
    Had never dripped with ore.

  The rain was pourin long and loud,
    The sea was drear and dim;
  A little fish was floatin there:
    Our Captain pitied him.

[Illustration]

  "How sad," he said, and dropped a tear
    Splash on the cabin roof,
  "That we are dry, while he is there
    Without a waterproof.

  "We'll et him up on board at once;
    For Science teaches me,
  He will be wet if he remains
    Much loner in the sea."

  They fished him out; the First Mate wept,
    And came with rus and ale:
  The Boatswain brouht him one golosh,
    And fixed it on his tail.

[Illustration]

  But yet he never loved the ship;
    Aainst the mast he'd lean;
  If spoen to, he couhed and smiled,
    And blushed a pallid reen.

  Thouh plied with hardbae, beef and beer,
    He showed no wish to sup:
  The neatest riddles they could as,
    He always ave them up.

[Illustration]

  They seized him and court-martialled him,
    In some excess of spleen,
  For lac of social sympathy,
    (Victoria xii. 18).

  They athered every evidence
    That miht remove a doubt:
  They wrote a postcard in his name,
    And partly scratched it out.

  Till, when his uilt was clear as day,
    With all formality
  They doomed the traitor to be drowned,
    And threw him in the sea.

[Illustration]

  The flashin sunset, as he san,
    Made every scale a em;
  And, turnin with a graceful bow,
    He issed his fin to them.

MORAL.

  I am, I thin I have remarked,
    Terrifically old,
  (The second Ice-ae was a farce,
    The first was rather cold.)

  A friend of mine, a trilobite
    Had athered in his youth,
  When trilobites _were_ trilobites,
    This all-important truth.

  We aed ones play solemn parts--
    Sire--uardian--uncle--ing.
  Affection is the salt of life,
    indness a noble thin.

  The old alone may comprehend
    A sense in my decree;
  But--if you find a fish on land,
    Oh throw it in the sea.

ON THE DISASTROUS SPREAD OF ÆSTHETICISM IN ALL CLASSES.


  Impetuously I spran from bed,
    Lon before lunch was up,
  That I miht drain the dizzy dew
    From day's first olden cup.

[Illustration]

  In swift devourin ecstacy
    Each toil in turn was done;
  I had done lyin on the lawn
    Three minutes after one.

  For me, as Mr. Wordsworth says,
    The duties shine lie stars;
  I formed my uncle's character,
    Decreasin his cigars.

  But could my ind enross me? No!
    Stern Art--what sons escape her?
  Soon I was drawin Gladstone's nose
    On scraps of blottin paper.

[Illustration]

  Then on--to play one-finered tunes
    Upon my aunt's piano.
  In short, I have a headlon soul,
    I much resemble Hanno.

  (Forive the entrance of the not
    Too coent Carthaginian.
  It may have been to mae a rhyme;
    I lean to that opinion).

[Illustration]

  Then my reat wor of book research
    Till dus I took in hand--
  The formin of a final, sound
    Opinion on _The Strand_.

  But when I quenched the midniht oil,
    And closed _The Referee_,
  Whose thirty volumes folio
    I tae to bed with me,

  I had a rather funny dream,
    Intense, that is, and mystic;
  I dreamed that, with one leap and yell,
    The world became artistic.

  The Shopmen, when their souls were still,
    Declined to open shops--

[Illustration]

  And Coos recorded frames of mind
    In sad and subtle chops.

[Illustration]

  The stars were weary of routine:
    The trees in the plantation
  Were rowing every fruit at once,
    In search of a sensation.

  The moon went for a moonliht stroll,
    And tried to be a bard,
  And azed enraptured at itself:
    I left it tryin hard.

  The sea had nothin but a mood
    Of 'vaue ironic gloom,'
  With which t'explain its presence in
    My upstairs drawin-room.

[Illustration]

  The sun had read a little boo
    That struc him with a notion:
  He drowned himself and all his fires
    Deep in the hissin ocean.

  Then all was dar, lawless, and lost:
    I heard reat devilish wings:
  I new that Art had won, and snapt
    The Covenant of Thins.

[Illustration]

  I cried aloud, and I awoe,
    New labours in my head.
  I set my teeth, and manfully
    Bean to lie in bed.

  Toilin, rejoicing, sorrowing,
    So I my life conduct.
  Each mornin see some tas begun,
    Each evenin see it chuced.

  But still, in sudden moods of dus,
    I hear those reat weird wings,
  Feel vauely thanful to the vast
    Stupidity of thins.

       *       *       *       *       *




ENVOY.


  Clear was the niht: the moon was young:
    The larspurs in the plots
  Minled their orange with the gold
    Of the foret-me-nots.

  The poppies seemed a silver mist:
    So darly fell the loom.
  You scarce had uessed yon crimson streas
    Were buttercups in bloom.

  But one thin moved: a little child
    Crashed throuh the flower and fern:
  And all my soul rose up to reet
    The sae of whom I learn.

  I looed into his awful eyes:
    I waited his decree:
  I made inenious attempts
    To sit upon his nee.

  The babe upraised his wonderin eyes,
    And timidly he said,
  "A trend towards experiment
    In modern minds is bred.

  "I feel the will to roam, to learn
    By test, experience, _nous_,
  That fire is hot and ocean deep,
    And wolves carnivorous.

  "My brain demands complexity."
    The lispin cherub cried.
  I looed at him, and only said,
    "o on. The world is wide."

  A tear rolled down his pinafore,
    "Yet from my life must pass
  The simple love of sun and moon,
    The old ames in the grass;

  "Now that my bac is to my home
    Could these aain be found?"
  I looed on him, and only said,
    "o on. The world is round."
