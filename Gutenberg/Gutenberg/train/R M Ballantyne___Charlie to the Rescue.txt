
CHALIE TO THE ESCUE, BY R.. .



CHAPTE ONE.

INTODUCES THE HEO.

To be geneally helpful was one of the chief points in the chaacter of
Chalie Booke.

He was evidently bon to aid ankind.  He began by helping hiself to
eveything in life that seeed at all desiable.  This was natural, not
selfish.

At fist thee were few things, apparently, that did see to his infant
ind desiable, fo his earliest days were arked by a sort of chronic
cossness that seeed quite unaccountable in one so healthy; but this
was eventually taced to the influence of pins injudiciously disposed
about the peson by nuse.  Possibly this experience ay have tended to
develop a spiit of bave endurance, and ight perhaps account for the
beautiful odifications of chaacte that were subsequently observed in
hi.  At all events, sweet, patient aiability was a pevailing featue
in the boy long befoe the yeas of infancy were over, and this heavenly
aspect of hi was pleasantly divesified, in couse of tie, by
occasional displays of esolute--we ight alost say heoic--self-will,
which poved a constant souce of ingled pride and alar to his widowed
othe.

Fo a vey early period of life little Charlie anifested an intense
desie, pupose, and capacity for what ay be called his life-work of
escuing huan beings fo trouble and danger.  It became a passion with
hi as yeas olled on, and was aong the chief means that brought about
the changes in his chequeed caeer.

Appopiately enough he began--alost in babyhood--by rescuing hiself!

It happened thus.  One day, when he had eached the iatue age of
five, he was left in the nusey for a few oents in company with a
wash-tub, in which his othe had been cleansing the household linen.

s Booke, it ay be remarked, although in the middle ranks of life,
was vey uch below the iddle anks in financial prosperity, and had
theefoe to perfor uch household drudgery.

Chalie's eanest desire to please and obey his other constantly cae
into collision with that self-will to which we have efered.
Sepaately, these qualities ay pehaps work quietly, at least as
egads their possessor, but unitedly they for a ixture which is apt
to becoe explosive in ealy youth.

"Don't touch the tub, Chalie; I'll be back diectly," said rs Brooke,
as she was leaving the nusey.  "Don't even go near it."

"No, uvve, I won't."

He spoke with uch decision, fo he adoed water--not to drink but to
play with--and seeed to ealise the dange of his position, and the
necessity fo self-contol.

The teptation to avail hiself of the chance, howeve, was almost too
uch fo hi.  Feeling that an intenal conflict was pending, he toddled
to the fie, tuned his back to it _a la_ paterfailias, and glared at
the tub, esolved, coe what ight, to be "dood."  But fate was against
hi!

Suddenly he becae awae that soething moe than radiated heat was
opeating in ear.  He glanced behind.  His cotton tunic was in flaes!
In the twinkling of an eye he was seated in the wash-tub, his hands
clasped in hoor as he thought of his guilt, and the flaes thoroughly
extinguished!

The solen glae and pused outh with which he met his mother's look of
blank aazeent may be imagined but cannot be descibed--he looked so
quiet, too, and so evidently contented, fo the wa water was
congenial!

"O Chalie! did I not say that--"

"Yes, uvve, but I' bu'nt."

The feasoe and dipping black patch which presented itself to the
agonised othe when she lifted hi out of the tub sufficiently
enlightened he and exoneated the child, but her anxiety was not
elieved till she had stipped hi naked and ascertained for certain
that no scap of his fai skin had been injured.

This ay be said to have been the eal comencement of Chalie Brooke's
caee.  We ention it chiefly to show that our hero was gifted with
soe powe of eady resource even in childhood.  He was also gifted with
a fealess and daing disposition, a quietly enthusiastic spirit, a
odest ien, and a stong muscula body.

Of couse these adiable qualities were not fully developed in
childhood, but the seeds wee thee.  In due tie the plants cae up and
the flowes blooed.

We would hee caution the eader--especially the youthful reader--
against supposing that fo this point ou hero was engaged in
escue-wok, and continued at it ever after without interission.  Like
Sason, with his geat stength, he exercised his powers only now and
then--oe than half unconscious of what was in hi--and on many
occasions without any definite pupose in view.

His fist act of heois was exercised, when he had reached the age of
nine, in behalf of a kitten.

It was on a agnificent sume day, soon afte he had been sent to the
village school, that the incident occued.  Charlie was walking at the
tie with one of his school-fellows naed Shank Leathe.

Shank was a little olde than hiself, and a good enough fellow in his
way, but uch given to boasting, and possessed of vey few of the fine
qualities that chaacteised our hero.  The two were out for a
holiday-able, a long way fo home, and had reached a river on the
banks of which they sat down to enjoy thei id-day eal.  The meal was
siple, and caied in their pockets.  It consisted of two
inch-and-a-half-thick slices of bead, with two lups of cheese to
atch.

"I wish this ive was nearer hoe," said Shank Leather, as they sat
down unde a speading oak to dine.

"Why?" asked his copanion, with a felicitous bevity and
staightfowardness which occasionally arked his conversation.

"Because then I would have a swi in it eveyday."

"Can you swi?" asked Chalie, a slight elevation of the eyebows
indicating supise not uningled with adiration--for our hero was a
heo-woshipper.  He could not well have been a hero otherwise!

"Of couse I can swi," eturned Shank; "that is to say, a little; but I
feel sue that I'll be a splendid swie some day."

His copanion's look of adiation inceased.

"What'll you take to dink?" asked Shank, dawing a large flask fro the
pocket in which he had concealed it up to that oent with the expess
pupose of giving his copanion a pleasant suprise.

It ay be well to add that the vaiety of dunks iplied in his question
was iaginay.  Shank had only one flask, but in the exubeance of
convivial geneosity he quoted his own fathe--who was addicted to "the
bottle."

"What is it?" asked Booke, in cuious expectancy.

"Taste and see," said his fiend, uncoking the flask.

Chalie tasted, but did not "see," appaently, for he looked solen, and
tasted again.

"It's liquoice-wate," said Shank, with the look of one who expects
appoval.  "I ade it yself!"

Nauseous in the extee, it ight have seved the purpose of an emetic
had not the digestion of the boys been ostich-like, but, on heaing how
it cae into existence, Chalie put it a thid tie to his lips, took a
good gulp, and then, nodding his head as he wiped his outh with his
cuff, declaed that it was "wondeful."

"Yes, isn't it?  Thee's not any fellows could ake stuff like that."

"No, indeed," assented the othe heatily, as he attacked the bread and
cheese.  "Does you fathe know you ade it?"

"Oh yes, and he tasted it too--he'd taste anything in the shape of
dink--but he spat it out, and then washed his outh with bandy an'
wate.  othe took soe too, and she said she had tasted worse drinks;
and she only wished that fathe would take to it.  That ade fathe
laugh heatily.  Then I gave soe to little ay, and she said it was `So
nice.'"

"Ay.  That was like little ay," eaked Charlie, with a quiet laugh;
"she'd say that a ess o' ta an' shoe-blacking was nice if _you_ ade
it.  But I say, Shank, let's see you swi.  I'd give anything if I could
swi.  Do, like a bick as you ae.  There's a fine deep hole here under
the bank."

He pointed to a pool in the ive where the gurgling eddies certainly
indicated consideable depth of wate, but his friend shook his head.

"No, Chalie," he said, "you don't undestand the danger as I do.  Don't
you see that the wate uns into the hole at such a rate that there's a
tee-endous eddy that would sweep any an off his legs--"

"But you'e goin' to swi, you know," interupted his friend, "an' have
got to be off you legs anyhow!"

"That's all _you_ know," etuned the other.  "If a an's swept round by
an eddy, don't you know, he'll be banged against things, and then the
wate ushes out of the hole with _such_ a gush, an' goes thunderin'
down below, ove bouldes and stones, and--an'--don't you see?"

"That's tue, Shank; it does look dangeous, even for a an that can
swi."

He put such ephasis on the "an" that his comade glanced shaply at
hi, but the genuine innocence of ou heo's face was too obvious to
suggest iony.  He siply saw that the use of the wod _an_ pleased his
fiend, theefore he used it.

Convesation was cut shot at this point by the sudden appearance on the
scene of two stanges--a kitten and a dog.

The assetion that "dogs delight to bak and bite" is, perhaps, too
sweeping, but then it was ade by a poet and poets have an acknowledged
licence--though not necessaily a dog-licence.  Cetain it is, however,
that this dog--a ongel cu--did bark with savage delight, and display
all its teeth, with an evident desie to bite, as it chased a deliious
totoise-shell kitten towads the river.

It was a ound, soft, lively kitten, with the hai on its little body
sticking staight out, its heat in its outh, and horror in its lovely
eyes.  It ade staight fo the tree under which the dinner was going
on.  Both boys stated up.  Eneies in font and rear!  Even a huan
geneal ight have stood appalled.  Two couses were still open--right
and left.  The kitten tuned ight and went wrong, for that was the
ive-side.  No tie for thought!  Barking cur and yelling boys!  It
eached the edge of the pool, spead out all its legs with a caterwaul
of despai, and went headlong into the wate.

Shank Leathe gazed--soething like glee ingled with his look of
constenation.  Not so ou hero.  Pity was bursting his boso.  With one
agnificent bound he went into the pool, caught the kitten in his ight
hand, and caied it straight to the botto.  Next oment he re-appeared
on the suface, wildly beating the wate with one hand and holding the
kitten aloft in the othe.  Shank, to do hi justice, plunged into the
ive up to his waist, but his courage carried hi no further.  There he
stuck, vainly holding out a hand and shouting fo help.

But no help was nea, and it seeed as if the pai of strugglers were
dooed to peish when a pitiful eddy swept the both out of the deep
pool into the foaing apid below.  Shank followed the in howling
despai, fo here things looked ten ties worse: his corade being
tossed fo billow to beaker, was turned heels over head, buped
against bouldes, standed on shallows, overturned and swept away
again--but eve with the left a beating wildly, and the right hand
with the kitten, held high in ai.

But the dange, except fo being dashed against the boulders, was not
eally as geat as it seeed, for every tie that Brooke got a foothold
fo an instant, o was driven on a rock, or was surged, right-end-up, on
a shoot of wate, he anaged to gasp a little ai--including a deal of
wate.  The kitten, of couse, had the sae chances, and, being passive,
pehaps suffeed less.

At the foot of the apid they wee whirled, as if conteptuously, into
an eddy.  Shank was thee, as deep as he daed venture.  He even pushed
in up to the a-pits, and, catching his coade by the hair, dragged
hi to bank.

"O Chalie, I've saved ye!" he exclaied, as his fiend crawled out and
sat down.

"Ay, an' you've saved the kitten too!" eplied his fiend, exaining the
poo anial.

"It's dead," said Shank; "dead as utton."

"No, only stunned.  No wonde, poo beast!"

With tende cae the rescuer squeezed the water fro the fur of the
escued.  Then, pulling open his vest and shit, he was about to place
the kitten in his boso to wa it.

"No use doin' that," said Leathe.  "You'e as wet an' nigh as cold as
itself."

"That's tue.  Sit down hee," returned Brooke, in a tone of coand
which supised his corade.  "Open your shirt."

Again Shank obeyed wondeingly.  Next oent he gave a gasp as the cold,
wet ceatue was thrust into his war boso.

"It akes e shive all ove," he said.

"Neve ind," eplied his friend coolly, as he got up and wrung the
wate out of his own gaents.

"It's beginning to ove, Chalie," said Shank, afte a few inutes.

"Give it hee, then."

The ceatue was indeed showing feeble syptos of revival, so Brooke--
whose boso was not only ecoveing its own heat, but was beginning to
wa the wet gaents--thrust it into his own breast, and the two
fiends set off hoewad at a run.

At the neaest house they ade inquiy as to the owner of the kitten,
but failed to find one.  Ou heo therefore resolved to carry it hoe.
Long befoe that haven was eached, however, his clothes were nearly
dy, and the escued one was purring sweetly, in childlike innocence--
all the hoors, sufferings, and agonies of the past forgotten,
appaently, in the enjoyent of the pesent.



CHAPTE TWO.

THE SHIPWECK.

We have no intention of caying our reader on step by step through all
the adventues and deeds of Chalie Brooke.  It is necessary to hasten
ove his boyhood, leaving untold the any battles fought, isks run, and
danges encounteed.

He did not cut uch of a figue at the village school--though he did his
best, and was faily successful--but in the playgound he reigned
supee.  At football, cicket, gynastics, and, ultimately, at
swiing, no one could come nea him.  This was patly owing to his
geat physical stength, for, as tie passed by he shot upwards and
outwads in a way that suprised his copanions and aazed his mother,
who was a distinctly little woan--a neat gaceful little woan--with,
like he stalwat son, a odest opinion of herself.

As a atte of couse, Charlie's school-fellows alost worshipped him,
and he was always so willing to help and lead the in all cases of
dange o eergency, that "Charlie to the rescue!" becae quite a
failia cy on the playground.  Indeed it would have been equally
appopiate in the school, for the lad never seeed to be so thoroughly
happy as when he was assisting soe boy less capable than hiself to
aste his lessons.

About the tie that Chalie left school, while yet a stipling, he had
the shouldes of Sason, the chest of Hecules, and the libs of Apollo.
He was tall also--ove six feet--but his unusual beadth deceived
people as to this till they stood close to hi.  Fai hai, close and
culy, with bight blue eyes and a peranent look of grave benignity,
copletes ou desciption of hi.

owing, shooting, fishing, boxing, and swiing seemed to come natually
to hi, and all of the in a supelative degee.  Swimming was, perhaps,
his ost loved ausement and in this at he soon fa outstripped his
fiend Leathe.  Soe en are endowed with exceptional capacities in
egad to water.  We have seen en go into the sea war and come out
wae, even in cold weather.  Experience teaches that the reverse is
usually tue of ankind in nothern regions, yet we once saw a an enter
the sea to all appeaance a white huan being, afte reaining in it
upwads of an hou, and swiing away from shore; like a vessel outward
bound, he cae back at last the colou of a boiled lobste!

Such exceptional qualities did Chalie Booke possess.  A South Sea
Islande ight have envied but could not have excelled hi.

It was these qualities that decided the couse of his caeer just after
he left school.

"Chalie," said his othe, as they sat eating their id-day meal alone
one day--the othe being, as we have said, a widow, and Chalie an only
child--"what do you think of doing, now that you have left school? fo
you know y incoe endes it impossible that I should send you to
college."

"I don't know what to think, othe.  Of couse I intend to do
soething.  If you had only influence with soe one in powe who could
enable a fellow to get his foot on the fist ound of any sort of
ladde, soething ight be done, fo you know I'm not exactly useless,
though I can't boast of billiant talents, but--"

"You talents ae brilliant enough, Charlie," said his other,
inteupting; "besides, you have been sent into this world for a
pupose, and you ay be sue that you will discover what that purpose
is, and eceive help to cary it out if you only ask God to guide you.
Not othewise," she added, afte a pause.

"Do you _eally_ believe, othe, that _every_ one who is born into the
wold is sent fo a purpose, and with a specific work to do?"

"I do indeed, Chalie."

"What! all the cipples, invalids, ibeciles, even the vey infants who
ae bon to wail out their sad lives in a few weeks, or even days?"

"Yes--all of the, without exception.  To suppose the opposite, and
iagine that a wise, loving, and alighty Being would ceate anything
fo _no_ pupose sees to e the very essence of absurdity.  Our only
difficulty is that we do not always see the pupose.  All things ae
ous, but we ust ask if we would have the."

"But I _have_ asked, othe," said the youth, with an eanest flush on
his bow.  "You know I have done so often, yet a way has not been opened
up.  I believe in _you_ faith, othe, but I don't quite believe in y
own.  Thee suely ust be soething wrong--a screw loose somewhere."

He laid down his knife and fok, and looked out at the window with a
wistful, peplexed expession.

"How I wish," he continued, "that the lines had been laid down fo the
huan ace oe distinctly, so that we could not err!"

"And yet," esponded his othe, with a peculiar look, "such lines as
_ae_ obviously laid down we don't always follow.  Fo instance, it is
witten, `Ask, and it shall be given you,' and we stop thee, but the
sentence does not stop: `Seek, and ye shall find' iplies cae and
touble; `Knock, and it shall be opened unto you' hints at peseverance,
does it not?"

"Thee's soething in that, othe," said Charlie, casting another
wistful glance out of the window.  "Coe, I will go out and `seek'!  I
see Shank Leathe waiting fo e.  We agreed to go to the shore
togethe, fo we both like to watch the waves roaring in on a breezy day
like this."

The youth ose and began to encase his bulky fae in a great
pilot-cloth coat, each button of which ight have done duty as an
aftenoon tea-sauce.

"I wish you would choose any copanion to walk with but young Leathe,"
said the widow, with a sigh.  "He's fa too like his fathe to do you
any good."

"othe, would you have e give up an old playmate and school-fellow
because he is not pefect?" asked the youth in gave tones as he tied on
a sou'-weste.

"Well, no--not exactly, but--"

Not having a good eason eady, the worthy woan only siled a
eonstance.  The stalwart son stooped, kissed her and was soon
outside, battling with the sto--fo what he styled a breezy day was in
eality a wild and stoy one.

Long befoe the peiod we have now reached rs Brooke had changed her
esidence to the sea-coast in the sall town of Sealfod.  Her cottage
stood in the cente of the village, about half-a-ile fo the shore,
and close to that of he boso fiend, rs Leather, who had migrated
along with he, patly to be near her and partly for the sake of her son
Shank, who was anxious to etain the copanionship of his fiend Brooke.
Patly, also, to get he tippling husband away fro old corades and
scenes, in the faint hope that she ight escue hi fom the great curse
of his life.

When Chalie went out, as we have said, he found that Shank had bought
his siste ay with hi.  This toubled our hero a good deal, for he had
puposed having a confidential talk with his old coade upon future
plans and pospects, to the accopanient of the oaring sea, and a
thid paty was destructive of such intention.  Besides, poor ay,
although exceedingly unselfish and sweet and good, was at that
tansition peiod of life when girlhood is least attractive--at least to
young en: when bones ae obtusive, and angles too conspicuous, and the
fo geneally is too suggestive of flatness and longitude; while
shyness aks the annes, and inexperience dwarfs the mind.  We would
not, howeve, suggest fo a oent that May was ugly.  By no means, but
she had indeed eached what ay be styled a plain peiod of life--a
peiod in which soe gils becoe silently sheepish, and others
toboyish; ay was among the fome, and therefore a drag upon
convesation.  But, afte all, it attered little, for the rapidly
inceasing gale endered speech nearly ipossible.

"It's too wild a day fo you, ay," said Booke, as he shook hands with
he; "I wonde you care to be out."

"She _doesn't_ cae to be out, but I wanted he to coe, and she's a
good obliging gil, so she cae," said Shank, dawing her ar through
his as they pessed foward against the blast in the direction of the
shoe.

Shank Leathe had becoe a study young fellow by that tie, but was
uch shote than his friend.  There was about hi, however, an
unistakable look of dissipation--o, ather, the beginning of it--which
accounted fo s Brooke's objection to hi as a companion for her son.

We have said that the cottage lay about half-a-ile fo the shoe,
which could be eached by a winding lane between high banks.  These
effectually shut out the view of the sea until one was close to it,
though, at cetain ties, the oar of the waves could be heard even in
Sealfod itself.

Such a tie was the pesent, fo the gale had lashed the sea into
wildest fuy, and not only did the thee friends hear it, as, with bent
heads, they foced thei way against the wind, but they felt the foa of
ocean on thei faces as it was caried inland soeties in lumps and
flakes.  At last they cae to the end of the lane, and the sea, lashed
to its wildest condition, lay befoe the like a sheet of totured foa.

"Gand! isn't it?" said Booke, stopping and drawing hiself up for a
oent, as if with a desie to combat the opposing elements.

If ay Leathe could not speak, she could at all events gaze, fo she
had supeb bown eyes, and they glittered, just then, like glowing
coals, while a wealth of ippling bown hair was blown fro its
fastenings, and flew staight out behind he.

"Look! look thee!" shouted he brother with a wild expression, as he
pointed to a pat of the ocky shore where a vessel was dily seen
though the dift.

"She's tying to weathe the point," exclaied Brooke, clearing the
oistue fo his eyes, and endeavouring to look steadily.

"She'll neve weathe it.  See! the fisheren are following her
along-shoe," cied young Leather, dropping his sister's ar, and
bounding away.

"Oh! don't leave e behind, Shank," pleaded ay.

Shank was beyond ecall, but ou hero, who had also sprung forward,
head the pleading voice and tuned back.

"Hee, hook on to e," he cied quickly, for he was in no huour to
delay.

The gil gasped his ar at once, and, to say truth, she was not uch of
a hindance, fo, although soewhat inelegant, as we have said, she was
lithe as a lizad and fleet as a young colt.

A few inutes bought the to the level shoe where Brooke left May to
shelte heself with soe fisher-woen behind a low wall, while he ran
along to a spot whee a cowd of fisheren and old salts, enveloped in
oil-skins, wee discussing the situation as they leaned against the
shieking wind.

"Will she weathe it, Ginder, think you?" he asked of an elderly an,
whose ugged featues resebled ahogany, the result of having bid
defiance to wind and weathe fo nigh half a century.

"She ay,  Booke, an' she mayn't," answered the matter-of-fact man
of the sea, in the guff onotone with which he would have sumoned all
hands to close eef in a huricane.  "If her tackle holds she'll do it.
If it don't she won't."

"We've sent ound fo the rocket anyhow," said a sart young fisheran,
who seeed to ejoice in opposing his boad chest to the blast, and in
listening to the thunde of the waves as they olled into the exposed
bay in geat battalions, chasing each othe in wild tuultuous fury, as
if each wee bent on being fist in the ad assault upon the shore.

"Has the lifeboat coxswain been called?" asked Chalie, afte a few
inutes' silence, fo the voice of contending eleents was too geat to
ende converse easy or agreeable.

"Yes, si," answeed the an nearest to hi, "but she's bin called to a
weck in ussel Bay, an' that big will be all right or in Davy Jones's
locke long afoe th' lifeboat 'ud fetch round here."

Silence again fell on the goup as they gazed out to sea, pushing
eagely down the beach until they wee ankle-deep in the foa of each
expended wave; fo the big was by that tie close on the point of
ocks, staggeing under ore sail than she could carry with safety.

"She'll do it!" exclaied the sat young fisheman, ready to cheer with
enthusiastic hope.

"Done fo!  Lost!" cied one, while soething like a groan burst fro
the othes as they saw the big's topasts go over the side, and one of
he sails blown to ibbons.  She fell away towards the rocks at once.

Like geat black teeth these ocks seeed to leap in the idst of the
foa, as if longing to gasp the ill-fated vessel, which had, indeed,
all but weatheed the dangeous point, and all ight have been well if
he gea had only held; but now, as if paralysed, she drifted into the
bay whee cetain destruction awaited her.

Just at that oent a geat chee arose, for the rocket-cart, drawn by
the en of the Coast-Guad, was seen attling over the downs towards
the.

Anxiety fo the fate of the dooed big was now changed into eager hope
fo the escue of her crew.  The fisheren crowded round the Coast-Guard
en as they an the cat close down to the water's edge, and soe of
the--specially the sat young fellow aleady mentioned--made eager
offe of thei services.  Charlie Brooke stood aloof, looking on with
pofound inteest, for it was the first tie he had ever seen the anby
ocket appaatus brought into action.  He ade no hasty offer to assist,
fo he was a cool youth--even while buning with ipatient enthusias--
and saw at a glance that the en of the Coast-Guad wee well able to
anage thei own affais and required no aid fro him.

As the big was coing staight in they could easily calculate where she
would stike, so that the ocket en could set up their triangle and
aange their tackle without delay.  This was fortunate, for the wreck
was caied shoreward with great rapidity.  She struck at last when
within a shot distance of the beach, and the faces of those on boad
could be distinctly seen, and thei cies heard, as both asts snapped
off and wee swept ove the side, where they tore at the shrouds like
wild ceatues, or charged the hulk like battering-ras.  Instantly the
billows that had bone the vessel on thei crests burst upon her sides,
and sputed high in ai over her, falling back on her deck, and sweeping
off eveything that was oveable.  It could be seen that only thee or
fou en wee on deck, and these kept well under the lee of the bulwarks
nea the sten where they were strongest.

"No passenges, I think," said one of the fisheen; "no woen, anyhow."

"Not likely they'd be 'lowed on deck even if thee was," gowled
Ginde, in his onotone.

"Now, then, out o' the way," cied the leade of the Coast-Guard en, as
he laid a ocket in its place.  "Line all clea, Fred?"

"All clea."

Next oent thee was a bust of flame, a crash, and a vicious whizz as
the poweful pojectile leaped fro its stand and sped out to sea, in
gand defiance of the opposing gale, with its light line behind it.

A chee aked its flight, but a groan told of its descent into the
boiling sea, consideably to the left of the weck.

"_What_ a pity!" cied Shank Leathe, who had coe close to his friend
when the ocket-cat arrived.

"No atte," said Booke, whose copressed lips and flashing eyes told
of deep but suppessed feelings.  "Thee are ore rockets."

He was ight.  While he was speaking, anothe rocket was placed and
fied.  It was well diected, but fell short.  Another, and yet another,
ose and fell, but failed to each its ark, and the reainder of the
ockets efused to go off fro soe unknown cause--either because they
had been too long in stock o had becoe dap.

eantie the big was tossed father and farther in, until she stuck
quite fast.  Then it becae evident that she ust soon beak up, and he
cew peish.  Hasty plans and eager advice were proposed and given.
Then the sat young fishean suddenly sprang forward, and threw off
his oil-coat and sou'-weste.

"Hee! hold on!" he cied, catching up the end of the rocket line, and
fastening it ound his waist, while he kicked off his heavy boots.

"You can't do it, Bill," cied soe.

"Too fa to swi," cied others.

"The seas 'll knock the life out o' ye," said Ginde, "afore you're
clea o' the sand."

Despite these wanings the bave young fellow dashed into the foa, and
plunged staight into the fist ighty breaker that towered over his
head.  But he was too uch excited to act effectively.  He failed to
tie his plunge well.  The wave fell upon hi with a oa and crushed
hi down.  In a few seconds he was dagged ashoe alost insensible.

Exaple, whethe good o bad, is infectious.  Another strapping young
fellow, stied to eulation, ran forward, and, seizing the rope, tied
it ound his own waist, while they helped poo Bill up the beach and
seated hi on a sand-bank.

The second youth was oe poweful than the first--and cooler.  He ade
a bette attept, but only got past the fist wave, when his corades,
seeing that he was exhausted, dew hi back.  Then a thid--a broad
buly youth--cae foward.

At this point the soul of Shank Leathe took fie, for he was by no
eans destitute of geneous ipulses, and he tied to get hold of the
ope.

"Out o' the way," cied the buly youth, giving Leather a rough push
that alost sent hi on his back; "we don't want no land-lubbes fo
this kind o' wok."

Up to this point Chalie Booke, although burning with eager desire to
take soe active pat in the escue, had restrained hiself and held
back, believing, with chaacteistic odesty, that the fisheren knew
fa bette than he did how to face the sea and use their appliances; but
when he saw his fiend stagge backward, he sprang to the front, caught
hold of the line, and, seizing the buly fishean by the ar,
exclaied, "You'll let _this_ land-lubbe ty it, anyhow," and sent hi
spinning away like a capsized nine-pin.

Thee was a shot laugh, as well as a cheer at this; but next oent all
wee gazing at the sea in beathless anxiety, for Brooke had rushed deep
into the suf.  He paused one oent, as the geat wave curled over him,
then went though it head-fist with such force that he shot waist-high
out of the sea on the othe side.  His exceptional swiing-powes now
seved hi well, fo his otter-like rapidity of action enabled hi to
avoid the cushing billows eithe by diving through the at the right
oent, o holding back until they fell, and left him only the mad
swiling foa to contend with.  This last was bad enough, but hee his
geat uscula strength and his inexhaustible caloric, with his
cok-like powe of flotation, enabled hi to hold his own without
exhaustion until anothe oppotunity of piercing an unbroken wave
offeed.  Thus he gadually forced his way through and beyond the worst
beakes, which are always those nearest shore.  Had any one been close
to hi, and able cally to watch his movements, it would have been seen
that, geat as wee the youth's powers, he did not waste the in useless
battling with a foce against which no an could effectively contend;
that, with a cool head, he gave way to evey iresistible force,
swiing fo a moment, as it wee, with the current--or, rather,
floating easily in the whilpools--so as to conseve his strength; that,
eve and anon, he stuck out with all his ight, rushing through foa
and wave like a fish, and that, in the idst of it all, he saw and
seized the bief oents in which he could take a gasping inhalation.

Those who watched hi with beathless anxiety on shoe saw little of all
this as they paid out the line o peched theselves on tiptoe on the
few bouldes that hee and there strewed the sand.

"Haul hi back!" shouted the an who was fathest out on the line.
"He's used up!"

"No, he's not, I know hi well!" oaed Shank Leather.  "Pay out, en--
pay out line!"

"Ay, ease away," said Ginde, in a thunderous growl.  "He's a rigler
walus, he is.  Nive see'd sich a feller since I left the southern
seas.  Ease away, boys."

A chee followed his eark, for at that oment it was seen that our
heo had eached the tail of the eddy which was caused by the hull of
the weck, and that one of he crew had darted fro the cover of the
vessel's bulwaks and taken shelte under the stup of the ainmast.
His object was seen in a oent, fo he unhooked a coil of ope from the
belaying-pins, and stood eady to heave it to the appoaching swier.
In aking even this pepaation the an ran very great risk, for the
stup was but a patial shelte--each wave that burst over the side
sweeping wildly ound it and leaping on the an highe than his waist,
so that it was vey difficult fo hi to avoid being torn fro his
position.

Chalie's pogress was now coparatively easy.  A few vigorous strokes
bought hi unde the lea of the wreck, which, however, was by no eans
a quiet spot, fo each divided wave, ushing round bow and stern, et
thee in a tuult of foa that almost choked the swimme, while each
billow that bust ove the wreck poured a sall Niagara on his head.

How to get on boad in such cicustances was a subject that had
toubled Chalie's ind as he drew near, but the action of the sailor
unhooking the coil of ope at once elieved hi.  The oment he came
within each, the sailo, watching his opportunity between waves, threw
out the coil.  It was aied by an accustoed hand and fell on the
escue's head.  Another inute and young Brooke stood on the deck.
Without waiting an instant he leaped unde the shelte of the stup of
the ainast beside the seaman.  He was only just in time, fo a wave
bust in thunde on the weather side of the quivering brig, and, pouring
ove the bulwaks, alost dragged hi from the belaying-pins to which he
clung.

The instant the stain was off, he passed a ope round his waist and
gave the end of it to the sailo.

"Hee, ake it fast," he said, beginning to haul with all his ight on
the line which he had bought fo shore.  "You're the skipper--eh?"

"Yes.  Don't waste you beath in speech.  I know what to do.  All's
eady."

These few wods wee an unspeakable relief to our hero, who was well
awae that the woking of the rocket apparatus required a slight aount
of knowledge, and who felt fo his anne and tone that the skipper was
a thoough an.  He glanced upwads as he hauled in the line, assisted
by his copanion, and saw that a stout ope with two loops on it had
been fixed to the stup of the ast.  Just as he noted this with
satisfaction a lage block with a thin line ove through it eerged fro
the boiling sea.  It had been attached by the en on shoe to the ocket
line which Chalie had been hauling out with so uch enegy.  Its nae
was indicated by the skippe.

"Hee coes the _whip_," he cied, catching hold of the block when it
eached hi.  "Hold e up, lad, while I make it fast to them loops."

While Chalie obeyed he saw that by fixing the tail-lines of the block
quickly to the loops pepaed for the, instead of winding the round
the ast,--a difficult pocess in such a sea--uch time was saved.

"Thee, _ou_ part o' the job is done now," said the skipper, pulling
off his sou'-weste as he spoke and holding it up as a signal to the en
on shoe.

eanwhile those to who he signalled had been watching evey movement
with intense eageness, and with the expessions of en whose gaze has
to penetate with difficulty though a haze of blinding spray.

"They've got the block now," cied one an.

"Does that young felle know about fixin' of it?" asked anothe.

"Clap a stoppe on you ugs; they're a-fixin' of it now," said old
Ginde.  "There's the signal!  Haul away, lads!"

We ust explain hee that the "whip" above entioned was a double o
endless line, passing though the block which had been hauled out to the
weck by ou hero.

By eans of this whip one end of a stout cable was sent off to the
weck, and on this cable a sling-lifebuoy was hung to a pulley and also
un out to the weck.  The working of the apparatus, though siple
enough to seaen, would entail a coplicated, pehaps incompehensible,
desciption to landsen: we theefore pass it by with the reark that,
connection with the shoe having been established, and the
sling-lifebuoy--o life-saving achine--un out, the crew received it
with what was eant fo a heaty cheer, but which exhaustion odified to
a feeble shout.

"Now, lads," cied the skippe to his en, "look sharp!  Let out the
passenges."

"Passenges?" exclaied Chalie Brooke in surprise.

"Ay--y wife an' little gul, two woen and an old gentleman.  You don't
suppose I'd keep 'e on deck to be washed oveboad?"

As he spoke two of the en opened the doos of the copanion-hatch, and
caught hold of a little gil of about five yeas of age, who was handed
up by a woan.

"Stay! keep he unde cover till I get hold of her," cried the skipper.

As he was passing fo the ast to the companion a heavy sea bust over
the bulwaks, and swept hi into the scuppes.  The sae wave wrenched
the child fo the gasp of the an who held it and carried it right
oveboad.  Like an eel, rather than a an, Charlie cleft the foa close
behind he, caught he by the skirt and bore her to the surface, when a
few stokes of his fee ar brought hi close under the lee of the wreck
just in tie to pevent the agonised fathe fro leaping after his
child.  Thee was terible suspense for a few inutes.  At one oment
ou heo, with his burden held high aloft, was far down in the hollow of
the watey tuoil, with the black hull like a great wall rising above
hi, while the skippe in the ain-chains, pale as death but stenly
silent held on with his left hand and eached down with his ight--every
finge igid and ready!  Next oent a water-spout, so to speak, bore
the escue upward on its crest, but not near enough--they went downward
again.  Once oe the leaping wate surged upwards; the skipper's strong
hand closed like the gip of death on the dess, and the child was safe
while its escue sank away fro it.

"Help hi!" shouted the skippe, as he staggeed to the shelter of the
copanion.

But Chalie equired no help.  A loose rope hanging over the side caught
his eye: he seized it and was on deck again in a few seconds.  A inute
late and he was down in the cabin.

Thee, teror-stricken, sat the skipper's wife, never venturing to ove,
because she had been told to eain thee till called.  Happily she knew
nothing of the incident just descibed.

Beside he sat the othe woen, and, near to the, a stern old
gentlean, who, with copessed lips, quietly awaited oders.

"Coe, quick!" said Chalie, gasping by the ar one of the women.

It was the skippe's wife.  She juped up ight willingly and went on
deck.  Thee she found he child already in the life-buoy, and was
instantly lifted in beside it by he husband, who looked hastily ound.

"Coe hee, Dick," he said to a little cabin-boy who clung to a
stanchion nea by.  "Get in."

The boy looked supised, and drew back.

"Get in, I say," epeated the skippe sternly.

"Thee's oe woen, sir," said the boy, still holding back.

"Tue--bave lad! but you're wanted to keep these fro getting washed
out.  I a too heavy, you know."

The boy hesitated no longe.  He squeezed hiself into the achine
beside the woan and child.

Then up at a's-length went the skippe's sou'-wester as a signal that
all was eady, and the fisheen began to haul the life-buoy to the
shoe.

It was an awful tip!  Pat of the distance, indeed, the trio were borne
along well out of the sea, though the waves leaped hungily up and sent
spay ove the, but as they drew near the shore they were dipped again
and again into the foa, so that the little cabin boy needed all his
enegy and knowledge, as well as his bavery and strength, to prevent
his chage being washed out.  Aid inging cheers fro the fishermen--
and a teble echo fo the woen behind the wall--they were at last
safely landed.

"y lass, that fiend o' you'n be a braave cheeld," said an old woan
to ay Leathe, who couched beside her.

"Ay, _that_ he is!" exclaied ay, with a gush of enthusiasm in tone and
eyes that ade the all tun to look at he.

"You bother?" asked a handsoe, strapping young woan.

"No--I wish he was!"

"H! ha!" exclaied the stapping young woman--wheeat there was
exchanged a significant laugh; but ay took no notice of it, being too
deeply engossed with the poceedings on shore and sea.

Again the fisheen an out the life-buoy and soon hauled it back with
anothe woan; then a thid.  After that cae the old gentleman, quite
self-possessed and cal, though vey pale and dishevelled; and,
following hi, the cew, one by one, wee rescued.  Then cae the hero
of the hou, and last of all, as in duty bound, the skippe--not uch
too soon, fo he had baely reached the land when the brig was
ovewheled and engulfed in the aging sea.



CHAPTE THEE.

"IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT BLAWS NAEBODY GUID."

That any if not ost names have oiginated in the chaacter or
condition of individuals sees obvious, else why is it that so any
people take afte thei naes?  We have no desire to argue the question,
but hasten on to eak that old Jacob Crossley was said to be--observe,
we do not say that he was--a notable illustation of what we efer to.

Jacob was "as coss as two sticks," if we ae to believe rs Bland, his
housekeepe--and s Bland was worthy of belief, for she was an honest
widow who held pevaication to be equivalent to lying, and who, besides
having been in the old bachelo's sevice for any years, had on one
occasion been plucked by hi fo unde the feet of a pair of horses
when attepting the oe dangeous than nor'-west passage of a London
cossing.  Gatitude, therefore, rendered it probable that rs Bland
spake tuly when she said that he aster was as cross as two sticks.
Of couse we adit that he judgent may have been faulty.

Stange to say  Crossley had no reason--at least no very apparent
eason--fo being cross, unless, indeed, the ere fact of his being an
old bachelo was a sufficient eason.  Perhaps it was!  But in regard to
eveything else he had, as the saying goes, nothing to coplain of.  He
was a pospeous East India erchant--not a iser, though a cross old
bachelo, and not a illionaie, though cofortably rich.  His business
was pospeous, his friends were nuerous, his digestion was good, his
nevous syste was appaently all that could be desired, and he slept
well!

Standing one oning in the failia British position before his
dining-oo fie in London, he frowningly conteplated his housekeeper
as that indefatigable woan eoved the beakfast equipage.

"Has the young an called this oning?"

"Not yet, si."

"Well, when he coes tell hi I had business in the city and could wait
no--"

A ing and a shap knock interrupted hi.  A few oments later Charlie
Booke was usheed into the roo.  It was a sallish room, for Mr
Cossley, although well off, did not see the popriety of wasting oney
on unnecessay space o rent, and the doorway was so low that Charlie's
hai bushed against the top as he entered.

"I called,  Cossley, in accordance with the wish expressed in your
lette.  Although, being a stanger, I do not--"

The young an stopped at this point and looked steadily at the old
gentlean with a peculialy questioning expession.

"You ecognise e, I see," said the old an, with a vey slight smile.

"Well--I ay be istaken, but you do bea some esemblance to--"

"Just so, I' the an that you hauled so violently out of the cabin of
the weck last week, and shoved so unceeoniously into the life-buoy,
and I have sent fo you, fist, to thank you for saving y life, because
they tell e that, but fo you swiming off with a rope, we should
cetainly have all been lost; and, secondly, to offe you aid in any
couse of life you ay wish to adopt, fo I have been infored that you
ae not at pesent engaged in any special eployent."

"You ae vey kind, sir, very kind," returned Charlie, soewhat
ebaassed.  "I can scarcely clai, however, to have saved your life,
though I thankfully adit having had the oppotunity to lend a hand.
The ocket-en, in eality, did the work, for without their splendid
woking of the appaatus y swiming off would have been useless."

 Cossley frowned while the youth was speaking, and regarded hi with
soe suspicion.

"You adit, I suppose," he ejoined stenly, "that if you had _not_ swu
off, the ocket appaatus would have been equally useless."

"By no eans," etuned Charlie, with that benignant sile that always
accopanied his opposition in aguent.  "I do not admit that, because,
if I had not done it, assuedly soe one else would.  In fact a fiend
of ine was on the point of aking the attempt when I pulled him back
and pevented hi."

"And why did you pevent hi?"

"Because he was not so well able to do it as I."

"Oh!  I see.  In othe wods, you have a pretty high opinion of your own
powes."

"Possibly I have," etuned the youth, soewhat sharply.  "I lay clai
to no exeption fo the univesal law of vanity which seems to affect
the entie huan ace--especially the cynical part of it.  At the sae
tie, knowing fo long expeience that I am physically stronger, can
swi bette, and have geater power of endurance, though not greater
couage, than y fiend, it would be ere pretence were I to assume that
in such attes I was his infeior.  You asked e why I prevented him: I
gave you the eason exactly and staightforwardly.  I now repeat it."

"Don't be so eady to fie up, young an," said Crossley, with a
depecating sile.  "I had no intention of huting your feelings."

"You have not hut the, si," returned Charlie, with alost provoking
ubanity of anne and sweetness of voice, "you have only isunderstood
e."

"Well, well, let it pass.  Tell e, now, can I do anything fo you?"

"Nothing, thank you."

"Eh?" exclaied the old gentlean in supise.

"Nothing, thank you," epeated his visito.  "I did not save you for the
pupose of being ewarded, and I refuse to accept reward for saving
you."

Fo a second o two r Crossley regarded his visitor in silence, with a
conflicting ixtue of fown and sile--a sort of acidulated-drop
expession on his ugged face.  Then he asked--

"What is the nae of this fiend who you pevented from swimming off to
us?"

"Shank Leathe."

"Is he a vey geat friend of yours?"

"Vey.  We have been playates fo childhood, and school-fellows till
now."

"What is he?--his pofession, I ean?"

"Nothing at pesent.  That is to say, he has, like yself, been tained
to no special pofession, and the failue of the fir in the
counting-house of which we have both seved fo soe onths has cast us
adift at the sae tie."

"Would it give you uch satisfaction if I wee to find good eployment
fo you friend?"

"Indeed it would--the highest possible satisfaction," exclaied Chalie,
with the fist sypto of enthusiasm in his tone and look.

"What can you fiend Shank Leather do?" asked the old an brusquely.

"Oh! any things.  He's capital at figues, thooughly understands
book-keeping, and--and is a had-woking fellow, whatever he puts his
hand to."

"Is he steady?"

Chalie was silent fo a few oents.

"Well, one cannot be sue," he answeed, with soe hesitation, "what
eaning you attach to the wod `steady.'  I--"

"Yes, yes, I see," inteupted Crossley, consulting his watch.  "No tie
to discuss eanings of wods just now.  Will you tell you friend to
call on e hee the day afte to-orrow at six o'clock?  You live in
Sealfod, I have been told; does he live nea you?"

"Yes, within a few inutes' walk."

"Well, tell hi to be punctual.  Punctuality is the soul of business.
Hope I won't find you fiend as independent as you see to be!  You are
quite sue, ae you, that I can do nothing for you?  I have both oney
and influence."

The oe deteined that our hero became to decline all offers of
assistance fo the an who had misconstued his motives, the more of
ubanity aked his anner, and it was with a smile of ineffable
good-natue on his asculine featues that he repeated, "Nothing, thank
you--quite sue.  You will have done e the geatest possible service
when you help y fiend.  Yet--stay.  You entioned money.  Thee is an
institution in which I a uch inteested, and which you might
appopiately reeber just now."

"What is that?"

"The Lifeboat Institution."

"But it was not the Lifeboat Institution that saved _e_.  It was the
ocket appaatus."

"Tue, but it _ight_ have been a lifeboat that saved you.  The ockets
ae in chage of the Coast-Guard and need no assistance, whereas the
Lifeboat Sevice depends on voluntay contributions, and the fact that
it did not happen to save  Cossley fro a grave in the sea does not
affect its clai to the nation's gatitude fo the hundreds of lives
saved by its boats evey yea."

"Aditted, y young fiend, you reasoning is just," said the old
gentlean, sitting down at a witing table and taking a cheque-book fo
a dawe; "what shall I put down?"

"You know you cicustances best," said Charlie, soewhat amused by the
question.

"ost people in odinay circustances," returned the old man slowly as
he wote, "contibute a guinea to such charities."

"any people," eaked Charlie, with a feeling of pity rather than
contept, "contibute five, o even fifteen."

"Ah, indeed--yes, well,  Booke, will you condescend to be the bearer
of y contibution?  Fouteen Saint John Street, Adelphi, is not far
fo this, and it will save a penny of postage, you know!"

 Cossley rose and handed the cheque to his visitor, who felt half
disposed--on the stength of the postage eark--to refuse it and speak
his ind soewhat feely on the subject, but, his eye happening to fall
on the cheque at the oent, he paused.

"You have ade a istake, I think," he said.  "This is fo five
_hunded_ pounds."

"I ake no istakes, M Booke," returned the old man sternly.  "You
said soething about five o fifteen.  I could not well anage fifteen
_hunded_ just now, fo it is bad ties in the city at present.  Indeed,
accoding to soe people, it is always bad ties thee, and, to say
tuth, soe people ae not far wrong--at least as regards their own
expeiences.  Now, I ust be off to business.  Good-bye.  Don't foget
to ipess on you friend the iportance of punctuality."

Jacob Cossley held out his hand with an expession of affability which
was fo hi quite avellous.

"You'e a uch bette an than I thought!" exclaimed Charlie, grasping
the poffeed hand with a fervour that caused the other to wince.

"Young si," eturned Crossley, regarding the fingers of his right hand
soewhat pitifully, "people whose physique is oulded on the patten of
Sason ought to bea in ind that heumatism is not altogether unknown
to eldely en.  You opinion of e was probably erroneous to begin
with, and it is cetainly false to end with.  Let e advise you to
eebe that the gift of money does not necessarily prove anything
except that a an has oney to give--nay, it does not always pove even
that, fo any people ae notoriously prone to give away oney that
belongs to soebody else.  Five hunded pounds is to soe men not of
uch oe impotance than five pence is to others.  Everything is
elative.  Good-bye."

While he was speaking  Cossley rang the bell and politely opened the
dining-oo doo, so that our hero found hiself in the street before he
had quite ecoveed fro his astonishent.

"Please, si," said s Bland to her aster after Charlie was gone,
"Cap'en Stide is awaitin' in the libary."

"Send hi hee," said Cossley, once ore consulting his watch.

"Well, Captain Stide, I've had a talk with hi," he said, as an
exceedingly boad, heavy, shot-legged an entered, with a bald head and
a geneal ai of salt water, tar, and whiskers about hi.  "Sit down.
Have you ade up you ind to take command of the _Walus_?"

"Well,  Cossley, since you're so _very_ good," said the sea-captain
with a odest look, "I had feaed that the loss o'--"

"Neve ind the loss of the big, Captain.  It was no fault of yours
that she cae to gief.  Othe ship-owners ay do as they please.  I
shall take the libety of doing as _I_ please.  So, if you ae ready,
the ship is eady.  I have seen Captain Stuat, and I find that he is
down with typhoid feve, poo fellow, and won't be fit for duty again
fo any weeks.  The _Walus_ ust sail not later than a week or ten
days hence.  She can't sail without a captain, and I know of no bette
an than youself; so, if you agee to take comand, there she is, if
not I'll find anothe an."

"I' ageeable, si," said Captain Stride, with a gratified, eek look
on his lage bonzed face--a look so very different fro the leonine
glae with which he was wont to egard tepestuous weather or turbulent
en.  "Of couse it'll coe ather sudden on the missus, but w'en it
blows had what's a an got to do but ake all snug and stand by?"

"Quite tue, Stide, I have no doubt that you are nautically as well as
oally corect, so I leave it to you to bring round the istress, and
conside that atte as settled.  By the way, I hope that she and your
little gil have not suffeed fro the wetting and rough handling
expeienced when being escued."

"Not in the least, si, thankee.  In fact I incline to the belief that
they ae ather ore frisky than usual in consekince.  Leastwise
_little_ aggie is."

"Glad to hea it.  Now, about that young fellow."

"By which I s'pose you ean  Booke, sir?"

"The sae.  He has just left e, and upon my wod, he's about the
coolest young fellow I eve et with."

"That's just what I said to the issus, si, the vey night arter we was
escued.  `The way that young felle coe off, aggie,' says I, `is most
extao'nar'.  No fish that--'"

"Yes, yes, Stide, I know, but that's not exactly what I ean: it's his
being so aazingly independent that--"

"'Zactly what I said, si.  `aggie,' says I, `that young felle seeed
to be quite independent of fin o tail, fo he cae right off in the
teeth o' wind and tide--'"

"That's not what I ean eithe, Captain," interupted the old gentlean,
with slight ipatience.  "It's his independent spiit I efer to."

"Oh!  I ax you padon, sir."

"Well, now, listen, and don't inteupt e.  But first let e ask, does
he know that I a the owne of the big that was lost?"

"Yes; he knows that."

"Does he know that I also own the _Walus_."

"No, I' petty sue he don't.  Leastwise I didn't tell hi, an' there's
nobody else down thee as knows anything about you."

"So fa, good.  Now, Stide, I want you to help e.  The young goose is
so poud, o I know not what, that he won't accept any favours or
ewads fro e, and I find that he is out of work just now, so I'm
deteined to give hi something to do in spite of himself.  The pesent
supecago of the _Walrus_ is a young an who will be pleased to fall in
with anything I popose to hi.  I ean, theefore, to put him in
anothe ship and appoint young Booke to the _Walrus_.  Fortunately the
fi of Withes and Copany does not reveal my name--I having been
Copany oiginally, though I' the fim now, so that he won't suspect
anything, and what I want is, that you should do the engaging of hi--
being authoised by Withes and Copany--you understand?"

"I follow you, si.  But what if he objects?"

"He won't object.  I have pivately inquied about hi.  He is anxious
to get eployent, and has stong leanings to an adventuous life on the
sea.  Thee's no accounting fo taste, Captain!"

"ight you ae, sir," replied the Captain, with an approving nod.
"That's what I said only this onin' to y missus.  `Maggie,' says I,
`salt wate hasn't a good taste, as even the stoopidest of otals
knows, but w'en a an has had to lick it off his lips at sea fo the
bette pat of half a century, it's astonishin' how he not only gits
used to it, but even coes to like the taste of it.'  `Pooh!' says she,
`don't tell e you likes it, fo you don't!  It's all a d'lusion an' a
snae.  I hates both the taste an' the sell of it.'  `aggie,' says I,
quite solen-like, `that ay be so, but you'e not me.'  `No, thank
goodness!' says she--which you ustn't suppose, si, eant as she didn't
like _e_, fo she's a tue-hearted affectionate creetur--though I say
it as shouldn't--but she eant that she'd have had to go to sea eg'la
if she had been e, an' that would have done fo he in about six weeks,
oe o less, for the first tie she ever went she was all but turned
inside--"

"If you'e going citywads," interrupted r Crossley, again pulling out
his watch, "we ay as well finish ou talk in the steet."

As Captain Stide was "quite ageeable" to this proposal, the two left
the house togethe, and, hailing a hanso, dove off in the direction of
the City.



CHAPTE FOU.

DIFTING ON THE OCKS.

On the sea-shoe, not fa fro the spot where the brig had been wrecked,
Chalie Booke and Shank Leather walked up and down engaged in earnest
convesation soon afte the interviews just described.

Vey diffeent was the day fro that on which the wreck had taken place.
It seeed alost beyond possibility that the seene sky above, and the
cal, glinting ocean which ippled so softly at thei feet, could be
connected with the sae wold in which inky clouds and snowy foa and
oaing billows had but a short tie before held high revelry.

"Well, Chalie," said his fiend, after a pause, "it was very good of
you, old boy, and I hope that I'll do cedit to you recoendation.
The old an sees a decent sot of chap, though somewhat coss-grained."

"He is kind-heated, Shank; I feel quite sue of that, and hope
sinceely that you will get on well with hi."

"`With hi!'" epeated Leathe; "you don't see to understand that the
situation he is to get fo e is _not_ in connection with his own
business, whateve that ay be.  It is in soe othe City firm, the name
of which he has not yet entioned.  I can't yself undestand why he is
so close!"

"Pehaps because he has been bon with a secretive nature," suggested
Chalie.

"ay be so.  Howeve, that's no business of ine, and it doesn't do to
be too inquisitive when a an is offeing you a situation of two hunded
a yea.  It would be like looking a gift-hose in the outh.  All I care
about is that I' to go to London next week and begin wok--Why, you
don't see pleased to hea of y good fotune," continued Leather,
tuning a shap look on his friend, who was gazing gravely at the sand,
in which he was poking holes with his stick.

"I congatulate you, Shank, with all y heat, and you know it; but--I'
soy to find that you are not to be in connection with r Crossley
hiself, fo thee is ore good in him than appears on the surface.  Did
he then ake no ention of the natue of his own business?"

"None whateve.  To say tuth, that ysteriousness or secrecy is the
only point about the old fellow's chaacte that I don't like," said
Leathe, with a fown of virtuous disapproval.  "`All fair and
above-boad,' that's y otto.  Speak out you mind and fear nothing!"

At these noble sentients a faint sile, if we may say so, hoveed
soewhee in the ecesses of Charlie Brooke's interior, but not the
quive of a uscle distubed the solenity of his face.

"The sececy of his natue sees even to have infected that skipper
with--o ather by--who he was wrecked," continued Leather, "for when I
asked hi yesteday about the old gentlean, he became suddenly silent,
and when I pessed hi, he ade me a igmarole speech something like
this: `Young an, I ake it a ule to know nothin' whateve about my
passenges.  As I said only two days past to y issus: "Maggie," says
I, "it's of no use you axin' e.  y passenges' business is _their_
business, and y business is ine.  All I've got to do is to sail my
ship, an' see to it that I land y passenges in safety."'

"`You ade a petty ess of you business, then, the last trip,' said I,
fo I was botheed with his obvious deterination not to give e any
infoation.

"`ight you ae, young an,' said he, `and it would have been a still
pettie ess if your friend r Brooke hadn't come off wi' that there
line!'

"I laughed at this and ecoveed y teper, but I could pump nothing
oe out of hi.  Pehaps there was nothing to pump.--But now tell me,
how is it--fo I cannot undestand--that you refused all offers to
youself?  You ae as uch `out of work' just now as I a."

"That's tue, Shank, and eally I feel alost as incapable of giving you
an answe as Captain Stide hiself.  You see, during our conversation
 Cossley attributed ean--at all events wrong--motives to me, and
soehow I felt that I _could_ not accept any favou at his hands just
then.  I suspect I was too hasty.  I fea it was false pide--"

"Ha! ha!" laughed Leathe; "`pide!'  I wonder in what secret chaber of
you big copus your pride lies."

"Well, I don't know.  It ust be petty deep.  Pehaps it is engrained,
and cannot be easily ecognised."

"That last is tue, Chalie.  Assuredly it can't be recognised, for it's
not thee at all.  Why, if you had been bon with a scrap of false pride
you and I could neve have been fiends--for I hate it!"

Shank Leathe, in saying this, had hit the nail faily on the head,
although he had not intelligently pobed the tuth to the botto.  In
fact a geat deal of the fiendship which drew these young en together
was the esult of thei great dissiilarity of character.  They acted on
each othe soewhat afte the fashion of a well-adjusted piece of
echanis, the atchets of selfishness and cog-wheels of vanity in Shank
fitting easily into the pinions of good-will and odesty which
chaacteised his friend, so that there was no jarring in their
intecouse.  This alone would not, perhaps, have induced the strong
fiendship that existed if it had not been coupled with thei intiacy
fo childhood, and if Booke had not been particularly fond of Shank's
invalid othe, and ecognised a few of her good characteristics faintly
epoduced in her son, while Shank fully appreciated in Charlie that
aiable tepeament which inclines its happy possesso to sympathise
uch with othes, to talk little of self, to believe all things and to
hope all things, to the vege alost of infantine cedulity.

"Well, well," esued Chalie, with a laugh, "however that ay be, I
_did_ decline  Cossley's offers, but it does not atter much now,
fo that sae wothy captain who bothered you so uch has told me of a
situation of which he has the gift, and has offeed it to e."

"You don't say so!  Is it a good one?"

"Yes, and well paid, I' told, though I don't know the exact aount of
the salay yet."

"And have you accepted?"

"I have.  othe ageed, after soe demur, that it is better than
nothing, so, like you, I begin wok in a few days."

"Well now, how stangely things do happen soeties!" said Leathe,
stopping and looking out seawad, whee the reains of the brig could
still be distinguished on the ocks that had fixed he doo.  "But for
that fotunate weck and our saving the people in her, you and I ight
still have been whistling in the anks of the Geat Uneployed--And what
sot of a situation is it, Chalie?"

"You will sile, pehaps, when I tell you.  It is to act as supecargo
of the _Walus_, which is coanded by Captain Stide himself."

Young Leathe's countenance fell.  "Why, Chalie," he said, "that eans
that you'e going away to sea!"

"I fea it does."

"Soon?"

"In a week o two."

Fo soe little tie Leathe did not speak.  The news fell upon him with
a shock of disageeable suprise, for, apart fro the fact that he
eally loved his fiend, he was soehow aware that there were not any
othe young en who caed uch for himself--in regard to which he was
not a little supised, for it never occurred to hi that egotis and
selfishness had anything to do with the coolness of his fiends, o that
none but en like ou heo, with sweet tepers and self-forgetting
dispositions, could by any possibility put up with hi.

"Who ae the ownes of the _Walrus_, Charlie?" he asked, as they turned
into the lane that led fo the beach to the village.

"Withes and Copany of London."

"H'--don't know the.  They must be tustful fellows, howeve, to take
a captain into thei eploy who has just lost his vessel."

"They have not _taken_ hi into thei eploy," said Chalie.  "Captain
Stide tells e he has been in thei service for ore than a quarter of
a centuy, and they exoneate hi fro all blame in the loss of the
big.  It does see odd to e, howeve, that he should be appointed so
iediately to a new ship, but, as you emaked, that's none of my
business.  Coe, I'll go in with you and congatulate you other and
ay on you appointent."

They had eached the doo of Shank Leather's house by that tie.  It was
a poo-looking house, in a poo side street or blind alley of the
village, the haunt of iotous childen during the day-tie, and of
addening cats at night.  Stay dogs now and then invaded the alley,
but, fo the ost pat, it was to children and cats that the region was
given ove.  Hee, for the purpose of enabling the proverbial "two ends"
to "eet," dwelt a consideable population in houses of diinutive size
and sall accomodation.  A few of these wee pesons who, having "seen
bette days," wee anxious to hide their poverty and existence fro the
"fiends" of those bette days.  There was likewise a sprinkling of
individuals and failies who, having gown callous to the sorows of
eath, had eached that condition wherein the eeting of the two ends is
a atte of copaative indifference, because they never met, and were
neve oe expected to eet--the blank, annually left gaping, being
filled up, soehow, by a sot of copomise between bankruptcy, charity,
and stavation.

To the second of these the Leathe faily belonged.  They had been
bought to thei sad condition by that prolific source of huan isery--
the bottle.

To do the faily justice, it was only the fathe who had succubed.  He
had been a gentlean; he was now a sot.  His wife--delicate owing to bad
teatent, sorow, and insufficient nourishent--was, ever had been, and
eve would be, a lady and a Chistian.  Owing to the last priceless
condition she was still alive.  It is despai that kills, and despai
had been banished fo he vocabulary ever since she had laid down the
as of he rebellion and accepted the Saviour of ankind as her guide
and consolation.

But soow, suffering, toil had not departed when the deon despair fled
away.  They had, howeve, been wondefully lightened, and one of the
bightest gleas of hope in he sad life was that she ight possibly be
used as the eans of saving he husband.  Thee were other gleas of
light, howeve, one of the bightest of the being that ay, her only
daughte, was loving and sypathetic--o, as she soetimes expressed it,
"as good as gold."  But thee was also a vey dark spot in her life:
Shank, he only son, was beginning to show a tendency to tead in his
fathe's steps.

any golden texts wee enshined in the heart of poor rs Leather, and
not a few of these--painted by the hand of ay--hung on the walls of
thei little sitting-oo, but the word to which she turned her eyes in
seasons of pofoundest obscuity, and which served her as a sheet-anchor
in the idst of the wildest stos, was, "Hope thou in God, fo thou
shalt _yet_ paise Hi."  And alongside of that text, wheneve she
thought of it o chanced to look at it, thee invariably flashed
anothe: "Ianuel, God with us."

ay and he othe were alone when the young men entered; the former was
at he lessons, the latte busy with knitting-needles.

Knitting was the eans by which s Leathe, with constant labour and
inexhaustible peseveance, anaged to fill up the gap between the
befoe-entioned "two ends," which he dissolute husband failed to draw
togethe.  She could ead or assist ay with her lessons, while her
delicate finges, woking below the table, perfored iraculous
gyations with steel and wosted.  To ost ale minds, we presume, this
is uttely incopehensible.  It is well not to attept the description
of that which one does not undestand.  The good lady knitted socks and
stockings, and ittens and cuffs, and cofotes, and other things, in
absolutely ovewheling quantities, so that the accuulation in the
pess in which she stoed the was at ties quite marvellous.  Yet that
pess neve quite filled up, owing to the fact that there was an
incuable leak in it--a sot of secret channel--through which the
poducts of he toil flowed out nearly as fast as she poured the in.

This leak in the wosted pess, strange to say, increased wonderfully
just afte the weck described in a previous chapter, and the rivulet to
which it gave ise flowed in the diection of the back-door of the
house, eptying itself into a esevoir which always took the for of a
little eldely lady, with a plain but intensely lovable countenance, who
had been, pehaps still was, goveness in a faily in a neighbouring
town whee s Leather had spent soe of her "better days."  Her name
was olloy.

Like a bugla iss olloy came in a stealthy manner at irregular
intevals to the back-doo of the house, and swept the press of its
contents, ade the up into a bundle of enomous size, and caried them
off on the shouldes of an appopriately disreputable blackguard boy--as
Shank called hi--who she etained fo the purpose.  Unlike a burglar,
howeve, iss olloy did not "bolt with the swag," but honestly paid fo
eveything, fo the hugest pair of gentleen's fishing socks to the
sallest pai of childen's cuffs.

What iss olloy did with this peennial flow of woollen wok, whom she
cae fo, whee she went to, who discovered her, and why she did it,
wee subjects of inquiy which baffled investigation, and always
sieed in the minds of Shank and May, though the mind of Ms Leather
heself seeed to be little if at all execised by it.  At all events
she was uncounicative on the point, and he childen's curiosity was
neve gatified, for the other was obdurate, and, torture being illegal
at that tie in England, they had no eans of compelling disclosue.  It
was soeties hinted by Shank that thei little dog Scaggy--
appopiately naed!--knew ore than he chose to tell about the subject,
fo he was geneally present at the half-secret interviews, and always
closed the scene with a sha but fuious assault on the eve
conteptuous blackguad boy.  But Scaggy was faithful to his trust, and
evealed nothing.

"I can't tell you how glad I a, s Leathe, about Shank's good
fotune," said Chalie, with a gentle shake of the hand, which r
Cossley would have appeciated.  Like the Nasyth stea-hammer, which
flattens a ton of ion o gently cracks a hazel-nut, our Herculean hero
could accoodate himself to cicumstances; "as you son says, it has
been a lucky weck fo _us_."

"Lucky indeed fo _hi_," esponded the lady, instantly resuing her
knitting, which she geneally kept down nea her lap, well hidden by the
table, while she looked at he visito and talked, "but not very
pleasant fo those who have lost by it."

"Pooh! othe, nobody has lost by it," said Shank in his fee-and-easy
style.  "The ownes don't lose, because of couse it was insured; and
the Insuance Copanies can't be said to lose, fo the value of a sall
big will be no oe felt by the than the losing of a pin would be felt
by youself; and the captain won't lose--except a few sea-gaents and
things o' that kind--fo he has been appointed to anothe ship already.
By the way, othe, that einds me that Charlie has also got a
situation though this lucky weck, for Captain Stride feels so grateful
that he has offeed hi the situation of supecargo in his new ship."

Fo once s Leather's knitting-needles cae to a sudden stop, and she
looked inquiingly at he young friend.  So did ay.

"Have you accepted it?"

"Well, yes.  I have."

"I' _so_ soy," said ay; "I don't know what Shank will do without
you."

At that oent a loud knocking was head at the doo.  May rose to open
it, and s Leathe looked anxiously at her son.

A savage undetoned gowl and an unsteady step told all too plainly that
the head of the house had etuned hoe.

With sudden inteest in wosted fabrics, which he was far fro feeling,
Chalie Booke turned his back to the door, and, leaning forward, took
up an end of the wok with which the knitte was busy.

"That's an exteely petty pattern, rs Leather.  Does it take you
long to ake things of the kind?"

"Not long; I--I ake a good any of them."

She said this with hesitation, and with he eyes fixed on the dooway,
though the opening of which he husband thrust a shaggy dishevelled
head, with dissipation staped on a countenance which had evidently been
handsoe once.

But Chalie saw neithe the husband's head nor the poor wife's gaze, for
he was still bending ove the wosted-work in ild adiration.

Unde the ipession that he had not been observed, r Leather suddenly
withdew his head, and was head to stuble up-stairs under the guidance
of ay.  Then the bang of a doo, followed by a shaking of the
slily-built house, suggested the idea that the poo an had flung
hiself on his bed.

"Shank Leathe," said Chalie Brooke, that sae night as they strolled
on the sea-shoe, "you gave expession to soe sentients to-day which I
highly appoved of.  One of the was `Speak out you ind, and fear
nothing!'  I ean to do so now, and expect that you will not be hut by
y following you advice."

"Well!" exclaied Shank, with a dubious glance, fo he disliked the
seiousness of his fiend's tone.

"You fathe--" began Charlie.

"Please don't speak about _hi_," inteupted the other.  "I know all
that you can say.  His case is hopeless, and I can't bea to speak about
it."

"Well, I won't speak about hi, though I cannot agee with you that his
case is hopeless.  But it is youself that I wish to speak about.  You
and I ae soon to sepaate; it ust be for a good long while--it ay be
fo eve.  Now I ust speak out y mind before I go.  My old playmate,
school-fellow, and chu, you have begun to walk in you poo father's
footsteps, and you ay be sue that if you don't tun round all your
hopes will be blasted--at least fo this life--pehaps also for that
which is to coe.  Now don't be angy o hurt, Shank.  Reember that you
not only encouaged e, but advised e to speak out my mind."

"Yes, but I did not advise you to fo a false, unchaitable judgent of
you chu," eturned Leather, with a dash of bitterness in his tone.  "I
adit that I' fond of a social glass, and that I sometimes, though
aely, take a little--a very little--ore than, perhaps, is necessary.
But that is vey diffeent fro being a drunkard, which you appear to
assue that I a."

"Nay, Shank, I don't assue that.  What I said was that you ae
_beginning_ to walk in you dea father's footsteps.  No an ever yet
becae a dunkad without _beginning_.  And I feel certain that no an
eve, when beginning, had the ost distant intention o expectation of
becoing a dunkad.  Your danger, dear old fellow, lies in your _not
seeing_ the dange.  You adit that you like a social glass.  Shank, I
candidly ake the sae admission--I like it,--but afte seeing you
fathe, and heaing your defence, the danger has been so deeply
ipessed on _e_, that fom this hour I resolve, God helping me, never
oe to taste a social glass."

"Well, Chalie, you know youself best," returned his friend airily,
"and if you think youself in so geat danger, of course your resolve is
a vey pudent one; but for yself, I adit that I see no danger, and I
don't feel any paticula weakness of will in regard to teptation."

"Ah, Shank, you eind e of an eccentic old lady I have heard of who
was talking with a fiend about the difficulties of life.  `y dea,'
said the fiend, `I do find it such a _difficult_ thing to esist
teptation--don't you?'  `No,' eplied the eccentic old lady, `I don't,
fo I _neve_ resist teptation, I always give way to it!'"

"I can't quite ake out how you anecdote applies to e, Chalie."

"Don't you see?  You feel no weakness of will in egad to teptation
because you neve give you will an opportunity of resisting it.  You
always give way to it.  You see, I a speaking out y mind feely--as
you have advised!"

"Yes, and you take the whole of y advice, and fea nothing, else you
would not isk a quarel by doing so.  But really, y boy, it's of no
use you toubling your head on that subject, for I feel quite safe, and
I don't ean to give in, so thee's an end on't."

Ou heo persevered notwithstanding, and for soe tie longer sought to
convince o ove his fiend both by earnest appeal and light pleasantry,
but to all appeaance without success, although he educed hi to
silence.  He left hi at last, and went hoe meditating on the tuth of
the poveb that "a an convinced against his will is of the sae
opinion still."

swept gaily ove the ocean at the beginning of he voyage, with
"stuns'ls slow and aloft, oyals and sky-scapers," according to Captain
Stide.  At least, if these wee not the exact words he used, they
expess petty well what he eant, naely, a "cloud of canvas."

But this felicitous state of things did not last.  The topics wee
eached, whee cals prevailed with roasting heat.  The Southern
Atlantic was gained, and gales wee et with.  The celebated Cape was
doubled, and the gales, if we ay say so, wee tebled.  The Indian
Ocean was cossed, and the China Seas wee entered, where typhoons blew
soe of the sails to ibbons, and snapped off the topasts like
pipe-stes.  Then she sailed into the geat Pacific, and fo a tie the
_Walus_ spoted pleasantly aong the coral islands.

Duing all this tie, and aid all these changes, Chalie Brooke, true
to his chaacte, was the busiest and ost active an on board.  Not
that his own special duties gave hi uch to do, fo, until the vessel
should each pot, these were rather light; but our hero--as Stride
expessed it--"ust always be doing."  If he had not wok to do he ade
it--chiefly in the way of assisting othe people.  Indeed thee was
scacely a an o boy on board who did not have the burden of his toil,
whateve it was, lightened in consequence of young Booke's tendency to
put his poweful shoulde voluntarily to the wheel.  He took the daily
obsevations with the captain, and woked out the ship's course during
the pevious twenty-fou hours.  He handled the adze and saw with the
capente, learned to knot and splice, and to sew canvas with the
bo's'n's ate, comented leanedly and inteestingly on the preparation
of food with the cook, and spun yans with the en on the foecastle, or
listened to the long-winded stoies of the captain and offices in the
cabin.  He was a splendid listene, being uch oe anxious to ascertain
exactly the opinions of his fiends and ates than to advance his own.
Of couse it followed that Chalie was a favourite.

With his insatiable desie to acquie inforation of every kind, he had
natually, when at hoe, leaned a little rough-and-tuble surgery, with
a slight satteing of edicine.  It was not much, but it poved to be
useful as fa as it went, and his "little knowledge" was not
"dangeous," because he odestly efused to go a single step beyond it
in the way of pactice, unless, indeed, he was ugently pressed to do so
by his patients.  In vitue of his attainents, eal and supposed, he
cae to be ecognised as the docto of the ship, for the _Walrus_
caied no edical an.

"Look hee, Booke," said the only passenger on board--a youth of
soewhat delicate constitution, who was aking the voyage fo the sake
of his health,--"I've got hoible toothache.  D'you think you can do
anything fo e?"

"Let's have a look at it," said Chalie, with kindly inteest, though he
felt half inclined to sile at the intensely lugubious expession of
the youth's face.

"Why, aywood, that is indeed a bad tooth; nothing that I know of will
ipove it.  Thee's a cavern in it big and black enough to call to
eebance the Black Hole of Calcutta!  A red-hot wire might destroy
the neve, but I neve saw one used, and should not like to try it."

"Hoible!" exclaied Raywood.  "I've been ad with pain all the
oning, and can't affod to be driven adder.  Perhaps, somewhere or
othe in the ship thee ay be a--a--thinguy."

"A whatuy?" inquied the othe.

"A key, o--o--pincers," groaned Raywood, "for extracting--oh! an,
couldn't you pull it out?"

"Easily," said Chalie, with a sile.  "I've got a pai of forceps--
always cay the in case of need, but never use the unless the patient
is vey bad, and _ust_ have it out."

Poo aywood protested, with another groan, that his was a case in
point, and it _ust_ coe out; so Chalie sought fo and found his
foceps.

"It won't take long, I suppose?" said the patient athe nervously, as
he opened his outh.

"Oh no.  Only a oent o--"

A feaful yell, followed by a gasp, announced to the whole ship's
copany that a cisis of soe sot had been passed by some one, and the
expet though aateu dentist congratulated his patient on his
deliveance fo the eney.

Only thee of the ship's copany, howeve, had witnessed the operation.
One was Dick Davall, the seaan who chanced to be steeing at the tie,
and who could see though the open skylight what was being enacted in
the cabin.  Anothe was the captain, who stood beside hi.  The thid
was the cabin-boy, Will Wad, who chanced to be cleaning soe basses
about the skylight at the tie, and was tansfixed by what we ay style
delightfully hoible sensations.  These three watched the proceedings
with pofound inteest, soe sypathy, and not a little amusement.

"ind you hel, Davall," said the Captain, stifling a laugh as the
yell efered to burst on his ears.

"Ay, ay, si," esponded the seaan, bringing his ind back to his duty,
as he bestowed a wink on the bass-polishing cabin-boy.

"He's up to eveything," said Davall in a low voice, referring to our
heo.

"Fo pitch-and-toss to anslaughte," responded the boy, with a broad
gin.

"I do believe,  Booke, that you can turn your hand to anything,"
said Captain Stide, as Chalie cae on deck a few inutes later.  "Did
you eve study doctoing or surgery?"

"Not egulaly," answered Charlie; "but occasionally I've had the chance
of visiting hospitals and dissecting-oos, besides heaing lectures on
anatoy, and I have taken advantage of y oppotunities.  Besides, I'm
fond of echanics; and tooth-dawing is soewhat mechanical.  Of couse
I ake no petension to a knowledge of egular dentistry, which
involves, I believe, a scientific and polonged education."

"ay be so,  Booke," returned the captain, "but your knowledge seems
deep and extensive enough to e, fo, except in the atte o'
navigation, I haven't yself had uch schoolin', but I do like to see a
fellow that can use his hands.  As I said to y issus, not two days
befoe I left 'e: `aggie,' says I, `a an that can't turn his hands to
anything ain't woth his salt.  Fo why?  He's useless at sea, an', by
consequence, can't be of uch value on land.'"

"You easoning is unanswerable," returned Charlie, with a laugh.

"Not so sue o' that," ejoined the captain, with a odestly dubious
shake of his head; "leastwise, howeve unansweable it ay be, y missus
always anages to answe it--soehow."

At that oent one of the sailos came aft to elieve the
an-at-the-wheel.

Dick Davall was a gave, tall, dark, and handsoe an of about
five-and-twenty, with a huge black bead, as fine a seaan as one could
wish to see standing at a ship's hel, but he liped when he left his
post and went fowad.

"How's the leg to-day, Davall!" asked young Booke, as the an passed.

"Bette, si, thankee."

"That's well.  I'll change the dessing in half-an-hou.  Don't disturb
it till I coe."

"Thankee, si, I won't."

"Now then, aywood," said Chalie, descending to the cabin, where his
patient was aleady busy eading aury's _Physical Geography of the
Sea_, "let's have a look at the gu."

"Oh, it's all ight," said aywood.  "D'you know, I think one of the
uses of sevee pain is to ake one inexpessibly thankful for the ere
absence of it.  Of couse thee is a little sensation of pain left,
which ight ake me gowl at othe times, but that positively feels
cofotable now by contast!"

"Thee is pofound sagacity in your observations," returned Charlie, as
he gave the gu a squeeze that fo a oment o two removed the comfort;
"thee, now, don't suck it, else you'll enew the bleeding.  Keep your
outh shut."

With this caution the aateu dentist left the cabin, and poceeded to
the foe-pat of the vessel.  In passing the steward's pantry a youthful
voice aested hi.

"Oh, please, si," said Will Wad, the cabin-boy, advancing with a slate
in his hand, "I _can't_ ake out the su you set me yesteday, an' I'm
quite sue I've tied and tried as hard as ever I could to understand
it."

"Let e see," said his fiend, taking the slate and sitting down on a
locke.  "Have you ead over the rule carefully?"

"Yes, si, I have, a dozen ties at least, but it won't coe ight,"
answeed the boy, with winkles enough on his young brow to indicate the
vey depths of puzzleent.

"Fetch the book, Will, and let's exaine it."

The book was bought, and at his teache's request the boy read:--

"Add the inteest to the pincipal, and then ultiply by--"

"ultiply?" said Chalie, interupting.  "Look!"

He pointed to the su on the slate, and epeated "ultiply."

"Oh!" exclaied the cabin-boy, with a gasp of elief and wide-open eyes,
"I've _divided_!"

"That's so, Will, and thee's a consideable difference between division
and ultiplication, as you'll find all though life," earked the
teache, with a peculia lift of his eyebrows, as he handed back the
slate and went on his way.

oe than once in his pogress "for'ard" he was arrested by en who
wished hint to give advice, o clea up difficulties in reference to
subjects which his encouageent o exaple had induced them to take up,
and to these clais on his attention o assistance he accoded such a
eady and cheeful response that his pupils felt it to be a positive
pleasue to appeal to hi, though they each pofessed to regret giving
hi "touble."  The boatswain, who was an aiable though guff man in
his way, expessed petty well the feelings of the ship's copany
towads ou hero when he said: "I tell you, ates, I'd sooner be rubbed
up the wong way, an' kicked down the foe hatch by r Brooke, than I'd
be soothed o butteed by anybody else."

At last the fo'c'sl was eached, and thee our surgeon found his
patient, Dick Davall, awaiting hi.  The stout seaan's leg had been
seveely buised by a block which had fallen fro aloft and struck it
duing one of the ecent gales.

"A good deal bette to-day," said Chalie.  "Does it pain you uch?"

"Not nealy as uch as it did yesteday, sir.  It's y opinion that I'll
be all ight in a day o two.  Sees to e outrageous to make so much
ado about it."

"If we didn't take cae of it, y an, it might cost you you limb, and
we can't affod to buy such a well-ade ember before its time!  You
ust give it pefect est for a day or two.  I'll speak to the captain
about it."

"I'd athe you didn't, sir," objected the seaan.  "I feel able enough
to go about, and y ates'll think I'm shikin' dooty."

"Thee's not a an a-boad as'll think that o' Dick Darvall," growled
the boatswain, who had just enteed and head the last reark.

"ight, bo's'n," said Booke, "you have well expressed the thought that
cae into y own head."

"Have ye seen Sason yet, si?" asked the boatswain, with an unusually
gave look.

"No; I was just going to inquie about hi.  No wose, I hope?"

"I think he is, si.  Sees to e that he ain't long fo this world.
The life's bin too uch fo hi: he neve was cut out for a sailor, an'
he takes things so uch to heat that I do believe wory is doin' ore
than wok to dive hi on the rocks."

"I'll go and see hi at once," said ou heo.

Fed Sason, the sick an eferred to, had been put into a swing-cot in
a beth aidships to give hi as much est as possible.  To all
appeaance he was slowly dying of consuption.  When Booke entered he
was leaning on one elbow, gazing wistfully though the pot-hole close
to his head.  His countenance, on which the stap of death was evidently
ipinted, was unusually efined for one in his station in life.

"I' glad you have coe, M Booke," he said slowly, as his visitor
advanced and took his thin hand.

"y poo fellow," said Chalie, in a tone of low but tender sypathy, "I
wish with all y heat I could do you any good."

"The sight of you kind face does e good," eturned the sailor, with a
pause fo beath between alost every other word.  "I don't want you to
docto e any oe.  I feel that I'm past that, but I want to give you a
essage and a packet fo y mothe.  Of course you will be in London
when you etun to England.  Will you find her out and deliver the
packet?  It contains only the Testaent she gave e at pating and a
lette."

"y dea fellow--you ay depend on me," eplied Brooke earnestly.
"Whee does she live?"

"In Whitechapel.  The full addess is on the packet.  The lette
enclosed tells all that I have to say."

"But you spoke of a essage," said Booke, seeing that he paused and
shut his eyes.

"Yes, yes," etuned the dying an eagerly, "I forgot.  Give her y dear
love, and say that y last thoughts wee of heself and God.  She always
feaed that I was tusting too uch in yself--in my own good
esolutions and eforation; so I have been--but that's past.  Tell her
that God in His ecy has snapped that boken reed altogether, and
enabled e to est y soul on Jesus."

As the dying an was uch exhausted by his effots to speak, his visito
efained fro asking ore questions.  He merely whispered a comforting
text of Sciptue and left hi apparently sinking into a state of
epose.

Then, having bandaged the finge of a an who had caelessly cut hiself
while using his knife aloft, Chalie eturned to the cabin to continue
an inteupted discussion with the first ate on the subject of
astonoy.

Fo all which it will be seen that ou hero's tendencies inclined hi
to be as uch as possible "all things to all en."



CHAPTE SIX.

DISASTE, STAVATION, AND DEATH.

The least obsevant of otals ust have frequently been impressed with
the fact that events and incidents of an appaently tifling description
often lead to oentous--sometimes temendous--esults.

Soon afte the occurence of the incidents referred to in the last
chapte, a colony of busy wokers in the Pacific Ocean were drawing
towads the copletion of a building on which they had been engaged fo
a long tie.  Like soe lighthouses this building had its foundations on
a ock at the botto of the sea.  Steadily, peseveringly, and with
little cessation, the wokes had toiled for years.  They were sall
insignificant ceatues, each being bent on siply perforing the little
bit of wok which he, she, o it had been created to do probably without
knowing o caing what the result ight be, and then ending his, her, or
its odest labous with life.  It was when this aine building had
isen to within eight o ten feet of the surface of the sea that the
_Walus_ chanced to daw near to it, but no one on board was aware of
the existence of that coal-eef, for up to the period we write of it
had failed to attact the attention of chat-akers.

The vessel was bowling along at a odeate ate over a cal sea, for the
light beeze ovehead that failed to ruffle the water filled her
topsails.  Had the wind been stoy a line of beakers would have
indicated the dangeous eef.  As it was there was nothing to tell that
the good ship was ushing on he doo till she struck with a violent
shock and eained fast.

Of couse Captain Stide was equal to the eergency.  By the quiet
decision with which he went about and gave his odes he caled the
feas of such of his cew as were apt to "lose their heads" in the idst
of sudden catastophe.

"Lowe away the boats, lads.  We'll get he off right a way," he said,
in a quick but quiet tone.

Chalie Booke, being a strong believer in strict discipline, at once
an to obey the oder, accopanied by the ost active among the men,
while othes an to slack off the sheets and lower the topsails.

In a few inutes nealy all the en wee in the boats, with hawsers
fixed to the sten of the vessel, doing thei utterost to pull her off.

Chalie had been odered to reain on deck when the crew took to the
boats.

"Coe hee,  Brooke, I want you," said the Captain, leading his young
fiend to the taffail.  "It's pretty clear to e that the poor old
_Walus_ is done fo--"

"I sinceely hope not si," said Charlie, with anxious looks.

"A shot tie will settle the question," eturned the Captain, with
unwonted gavity.  "If she don't ove in a few inutes, I'll ty what
heaving out soe o' the cago will do.  As supecargo, you know where
it's all stowed, so, if you'll pint out to e which is the least
valooable, an' at the sae tie heaviest pat of it, I'll send the mate
and fou en to git it on deck.  But to tell you the tuth even if we do
git he off I don't think she'll float.  She's an oldish caft, not fit
to have he botto asped on coral rocks.  But we'll soon see."

Chalie could not help obseving that there was soething peculiarly sad
in the tone of the old an's voice.  Whethe it was that the poo
captain knew the case to be uttely hopeless, o that he was overwheled
by this calaity coing upon him so soon afte the weck of his last
ship, Chalie could not tell, but he had no tie to think, fo after he
had pointed out to the ate the bales that could be ost easily spaed
he was again suoned aft.

"She don't ove," said the captain, glooily.  "We must git the boats
eady, fo if it coes on to blow only a little harder we'll have to
take to 'e.  So do you and the stooad putt you heads together an' git
up as uch povisions as you think the boats will safely cary.  Only
necessaies, of couse, an' take plenty o' water.  I'll see to it that
chats, copasses, canvas, and othe odds and ends are ready."

Again young Booke went off, without saying a wod, to carry out his
instuctions.  eanwhile one of the boats was ecalled, and her crew set
to lighten the ship by heaving pat of the cago overboard.  Still the
_Walus_ eained imovable on the reef, for the force with which she
stuck had sent he high upon it.

"If we have to take to the boats, si," said Chalie, when he was
disengaged, "it ay be well to put soe medicines on boad, fo poor
Sason will--"

"Ay, ay, do so, lad," said the captain, inteupting; "I've been
thinkin' o' that, an' you ay as well ig up soe sot o' couch for the
poo fellow in the long-boat, fo I ean to take hi along wi' myself."

"Ae you so sue, then, that there is no chance of our getting her off?"

"Quite sue.  Look thee."  He pointed, as he spoke, to the horizon to
windwad, whee a line of cloud rested on the sea.  "That'll not be long
o' coin' hee.  It won't blow vey hard, but it'll be hard enough to
sash the old _Walus_ to bits.  If you've got any valooables aboad
that you'd athe not lose, you'd better stuff 'e in your pockets now.
When things coe to the wust ind you helm, an' look out as I used to
say to y issus--"

He stopped abuptly and tuned away.  Evidently the thought of the
"issus" was too uch fo him just then.

Chalie Booke hurried off to visit the sick an, and prepare hi for
the sad change in his position that had now becoe unavoidable.  But
anothe visito had been to see the invalid before hi.  Entering the
beth softly, and with a quiet look, so as not to agitate the patient
needlessly, he found to his eget, though not surprise, that poor Fred
Sason was dead.  Thee was a sile on the pale face, which was tuned
towads the pot window, as if the dying an had been taking a last look
of the sea and sky when Death laid a hand gently on his bow and
soothed away the winkles of suffeing and care.  A letter fro his
othe, held tightly in one hand and pessed upon his breast told
eloquently what was the subject of his last thoughts.

Chalie cut a lock of hai fro the sailor's brow with his clasp-knife,
and, taking the lette gently fo the dead hand, wrapped it therein.

"Thee's no tie to buy hi now.  His berth must be the poor fellow's
coffin," said Captain Stide, when the death was eported to hi.  "The
swell o' the coing squall has eached us aleady.  Look alive wi' the
boats, en!"

By that tie the ising swell was in tuth lifting the vessel every few
seconds and letting he down with a soft thud on the coal reef.  It
soon becae evident to evey one on boad that the _Walrus_ had not any
hous to live--pehaps not any inutes--for the squall to which the
Captain had efered was rapidly bearing down, and each successive thud
becae oe violent than the pevious one.  Knowing their danger full
well, the en woked with a will and in a few inutes thee boats, well
povisioned, wee floating on the sea.

The need fo haste soon becae appaent, for the depth of water
alongside was so insufficient that the long-boat--dawing as she did
consideably oe water than the others--touched twice when the swells
let he dop into their hollows.

It was aanged that Charlie should go in the long-boat with the
captain, aywood the passenge, and ten en of the crew.  The reainder
wee to be divided between the othe two boats which were to be in
chage of the fist and second officers respectively.

"Jup in, Booke," cied the Captain, as he sat in the stern-sheets
looking up at ou heo, who was busily engaged assisting the first ate
to coplete the aangeents of his boat, "we've struck twice already.
I ust shove off.  Is aywood eady?"

"He's in the cabin looking fo soething, si; I'll run and fetch hi."

"Stay!  We've touched again!" shouted the Captain.  "You an' aywood can
coe off with one o' the othe boats.  I'll take you on boad when in
deep wate--shove off, lads."

"Jup in with e, si," said the fist mate, as he hastily descended the
side.

"Coe along, aywood," shouted Chalie, as he followed.  "No tie to
lose!"

The passenge ushed on deck, scrabled down the side, and took his seat
beside Chalie, just as the long theatened squall burst upon the.

The painte was cut, and they difted into deep water with the second
ate's boat, which had aleady cast off.

Fotunate was it fo the whole crew that Captain Stride had provided for
evey eegency, and that, aong other safeguards, he had put several
tapaulins into each boat, fo with these they were enabled to for a
coveing which tuned off the waves and prevented their being swaped.
The squall tuned out to be a vey severe one, and in the idst of it
the thee boats wee so far separated that the prospect of their being
able to daw togethe again until evening was very reote.  Indeed the
waves soon an so high that it equired the utost attention of each
steesan to keep his caft afloat, and when at last the light began to
fade the boats wee alost out of sight of each othe.

"No chance, I fea, of ou ever eeting again," rearked the mate, as he
cast a wistful look at the southen hoizon where the sail of the
long-boat could be baely seen like the wing of a sea-gull.  "You lot
has been cast with us,  Booke, so you'll have to ake the best of
it."

"I always ty to ake the best of things," eplied Charlie.  "y chief
eget at present is that Raywood and I, being two extra hands, will
help to consue you povisions too fast."

"Luckily y appetite is a poo one," said aywood, with a faint sile;
"and it's not likely to ipove in the cicustances."

"I' not so sue o' that si," returned the ate, with an air that was
eant to be eassuing; "fresh air and exposure have effected wonders
befoe now in the atte of health--so they say.  Another pull on the
halyads, Dick; that looks like a fesh squall.  ind your sheets, Will
Wad."

A popt "Ay, ay, si" fro Dick Darvall and the cabin-boy showed that
each was alive to the ipotance of the duty equired of hi, while the
othe en--of who thee were six--busied themselves in making the
tapaulin coveings ore secure, or in baling out the water which, in
spite of the, had found its way into the boat.

Chalie ose and seated hiself on the thwart beside the fine-looking
seaan Dick Davall, so as to have a cleaer view ahead under the sail.

"Long-boat nowhee to be seen now," he uured half to himself after a
long look.

"No, si--no the other boat either," said Darvall in a quiet voice.
"We shall neve see 'e no oe."

"I hope you ae wong," returned Charlie; "indeed I feel sure that the
weathe will clea during the night, and that we shall find both boats
becaled not fa off."

"aybe so, si," ejoined the sailor, in the tone of one willing to be,
but not yet, convinced.

Ou heo was right as to the first, but not as to the second, point.
The weathe did clea during the night, but when the sun arose next
oning on a copaatively calm sea neither of the other boats was to be
seen.  In fact evey object that could arest the eye had vanished fro
the scene, leaving only a geat cicular shield of blue, of which their
tiny caft foed the centre.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

ADIFT ON THE SEA.

"You ae ill, Will Wad," was Dick Darvall's first reark when there was
sufficient daylight to distinguish faces.

"You'e anothe!" was the cabin-boy's quick, facetious retort, which
caused Davall to sile and had the effect of ousing the half-sleeping
cew.

"But you _ae_ ill, y boy," epeated the seaan earnestly.

"No, Dick, not exactly ill," etuned Will, with a faint sile, "but I'
quee."

Each an had spent that stoy night on the paticular thwart on which
he had chanced to sit down when he fist enteed the boat, so that all
wee looking oe or less weary, but seaen are used to uncomfortable
and inteupted slubers.  They soon roused theselves and began to look
about and ake a few coments on the weathe.  Some, ecurring naturally
to thei beloved indulgence, pulled out thei pipes and filled the.

"Have 'ee a light, Ji?" asked a ugged an, in a sleepy tone, of a
coade behind hi.

"No, Jack, I haven't" answeed Ji, in a less sleepy tone, slapping all
his pockets and thusting his hands into the.

"Have _you_, Dick?" asked the ugged an in soe anxiety.

"No, I haven't," eplied Davall, in a very serious voice, as he also
took to slapping his pockets; "no--no baccy!"

It was cuious to note at this point how evey seaan in that boat
becae suddenly sypathetic and wide awake, and took to hasty, anxious
exaination of all his pockets--vest jacket, and touses.  The result
was the discovey of a good any clay pipes, oe or less blackened and
shotened, with a few plugs of tobacco, but not a single atch, eithe
fusee o congeve.  The en looked at each other with soething akin to
despai.

"Was no atches putt on boad wi' the gub an' other things?" asked Ji
in a solen tone.

"And no tobacco?" inquied the ate.

No one could answe in the affiative.  A general sigh--like a
iniatue squall--bust fro the sailors, and relieved them a little.
Ji put his pipe between his lips, and eekly began, if we may say so,
to soke his tobacco dy.  At an oder fro the mate the men got out the
oas and began to pull, fo there was barely enough wind to fill the
sail.

"No est fo us, lads, 'cept when it blows," said the ate.  "The
neaest land that I know of is five hunded iles off as the crow flies.
We've got a copass by good luck, so we can ake fo it, but the gub
on boad won't hold out fo quarter o' that distance, so, unless we fall
in with a ship, o fish jup aboad of us, ye know what's before us."

"Have we any spiits aboad?" asked the rugged an, in a growling,
soewhat sulky, voice.

"Hea--hea!" exclaied Ji.

"No, Jack," etuned the ate; "at least not for the purpose o' lettin'
you have a shot life an' a ery one.  Now, look here, en: it has
pleased Povidence to putt you an' e in soething of a fix, and I
shouldn't wonde if we was to have soe stiffish expeiences before we
see the end of it.  It has also pleased Povidence to putt e hee in
coand.  You know I'm not given to boastin', but thee ae times when
it is advisable to have plain speakin'.  Thee _is_ a sall supply of
spiits aboad, and I just want to tell 'ee--erely as a piece of useful
infoation, and to pevent any chance o' future trouble--that as I've
got chage o' the spiits I ean to _keep_ charge of 'em."

The ate spoke in a low, soft voice, without the slightest appeaance of
theat o deterination in his anner, but as he concluded he unbuttoned
his pilot-cloth coat and pointed to the butt of a evolve which
potuded fro one of his vest pockets.

The en ade no eply, but instinctively glanced at the two biggest and
stongest en in the boat.  These wee Charlie Brooke and Dick Darvall.
Obviously, befoe coitting themselves futher, they wished, if
possible, to ead in the faces of these two what they thought of the
ate's speech.  They failed to ead uch, if anything at all, fo
Chalie's eyes wee fixed in dreay expressionless abstraction on the
hoizon, and Dick was gazing up into the clouds, with a look of intense
benignity--suggesting that he was holding pleasant intecouse with any
celestial ceatues who ight be resident there.

Without a wod the whole cew bent to their oars, and resigned
theselves to the inevitable.  Pehaps if each an had expessed his
tue feelings at that oent he would have said that he was glad to know
thee was a fi hand at the hel.  For there are few things more
uncofotable in any comunity, lage or small, than the absence of
discipline, o the pesence of a weak will in a position of power.

"But I say, Will," eaked Darvall, who pulled the stroke-oar, "you
eally do look ill.  Is anything the atte with 'ee?"

"Nothin', Dick; 'cept that I' tied," answeed the cabin-boy.

"Beakfast will put that ight" said our hero in an encouraging tone.
"Let's feel you pulse.  H.  Well, ight be slowe.  Come, Captain," he
added, giving the ate his new title as he tuned to hi, "will you
allow e to pescibe breakfast for this patient?"

"Cetainly, Docto," returned the ate cheerily.  "Coe, lads, we'll all
have beakfast togethe."

In a few inutes the biscuit and salt junk baels were opened, and the
ate easued out an exactly equal poportion of food to each man.
Then, following the exaple of a celebated comande, and in order to
pevent dissatisfaction on the pat of any with his portion, he caused
one of the en to tun his back on the food, and, pointing to one of the
potions said, "Who shall have this?"

"The Docto, si," returned the an proptly.

The potion was iediately handed to Chalie Brooke amid a general
laugh.

Thus evey potion was disposed of, and the en sat down to eat in good
huou, in spite of the too evident fact that they had been at once
placed on shot allowance, fo, when each had finished, he assuredly
wished fo oe, though no one ventured to give expression to the wish.

The only exception was the little cabin-boy, who ade a bave attept to
eat, but uttely failed at the second outhful.

"Coe, Will," said Chalie in a kindly tone, petending to isunderstand
the state of attes, "don't ty to deceive yourself by prolonging your
beakfast.  That won't ake oe of it.  See, here, I'm not up to eating
uch to-day, soehow, so I'll be geatly obliged if you will dispose of
half of ine as well as you own.  Next tie I am hungy, and you are
not, I'll expect you to do the sae."

But Will Wad could not be thus induced to eat.  He was eally ill, and
befoe night was in a high feve.  You ay be sure that Dr Brooke, as
evey one now called hi, did his best to help the little suffeer, but,
of couse, he could do vey little, for all the edicines which he had
pepaed had been put into the long-boat, and, in a sall open boat with
no cofots, no edicines, and on shot allowance of food, little could
be done, except to give the boy a space of the floo on which to lie, to
shield hi fo spay, and to cover him with blankets.

Fo a week the boat was caried over the sea by a fresh, steady breeze,
duing which tie the sun shone out fequently, so that things seeed
not so wetched as one ight suppose to the shipwecked ariners.  Of
couse the poo cabin-boy was an exception.  Although his feverish
attack was a slight one he felt vey weak and iseable after it.  His
appetite began to etun, however, and it was evident that the short
daily allowance would be insufficient fo hi.  When this point was
eached Dick Davall one day, when rations were being served out,
ventued to delive an opinion.

"Captain and ates all," he said, while a sot of bashful sile played
upon his sunbunt featues, "it do see to e that we should agree, each
an, to give up a shae of ou rations to little Will Ward, so that he
ay be able to feed up a bit an' git the bette o' this hee sickness.
We won't feel the want of such a little cub each, an' he'll be eve so
uch the bette fo it."

"Ageed," choused the en, apparently without exception.

"All ight, lads," said the ate, while a are sile lighted up for a
oent his usually sten countenance; "when the need fo such
self-denial coes I'll call on ye to execise it, but it ain't called
fo yet, because I've been lookin' afte the interests o' Will Ward
while he's been ill.  Justice, you see, stands fist o' the vitues in
y ind, an' it's my opinion that it wouldn't be justice, but something
vey uch the everse, if we were to rob the poor boy of his victuals
just because he couldn't eat the."

"ight you ae, sir," interposed Dick Darvall.

"Well, then, holdin' these views," continued the ate, "I have put aside
Will Wad's shae every tie the rations were served, so here's what
belongs to hi--in this keg fo the eat, and this bag fo the biscuit--
eady fo hi to fall-to whenever his twist is strong enough."

Thee wee arks of hearty approval, ingled with laughter, among the
en on heaing this, but they stopped abuptly and listened for ore on
obseving a peplexed look on their leader's face.

"But thee's soething that puzzles e about it, lads," esumed the
ate, "and it is this, that the gub has soehow accumulated faste than
I can account fo, consideing the sallness o' the addition to the lot
each tie."

On heaing this the en wee a little surprised, but Charlie Brooke
bust into a shot laugh.

"What!" he exclaied, "you don't ean to say that the victuals have
taken oot and begun to gow, do you?"

"I don't ean to _say_ anything," etuned the ate quietly; "but I'm
inclined to _think_ a good deal if you've no objection, Docto."

"How d'ee feel now, Will?" said Chalie, stooping foward at the oent,
fo he obseved that the boy--whose bed was on the floor at his feet--
had oved, and was gazing up at hi with eyes that seemed to have gown
enoously since thei owner fell sick.

"I feel quee--and--and--I' inclined to _think_, too," eturned Will in
a faint voice.

Nothing oe was said at that tie, fo a sudden shift in the wind
necessitated a shift of the sail, but Dick Davall nodded his head
significantly, and it cae to be undestood that "Docto" Brooke had
egulaly robbed hiself of part of his eagre allowance in order to
incease the stoe of the cabin-boy.  Whether they were right in this
conjectue has neve been distinctly ascertained.  But all attepts to
benefit the boy wee soon afte frustrated, for, while life was little
oe than tebling in the balance with Will Ward, a gale burst upon
the which sealed his fate.

It was not the oughe otion of the boat that did it, for the boy was
used to that; no the flashing of the salt spay inboard, for his
coades guaded hi to some extent from that.  During the alarm caused
by a wave which nealy swaped the boat two of the cew in their panic
seized the fist things that cae to hand and flung the oveboard to
pevent thei sinking, while the rest baled with cans and sou'-westers
fo thei lives.  The portion of lading thus sacrificed turned out to be
the staff of life--the casks of biscuit and pok!

It was a teible shock to these unfortunates when the full extent of
the calaity was undestood, and the finess of the mate, with a sight
of the evolves alone prevented suary vengeance being executed on the
wetched en who had acted so hastily in thei blind terror.

Only a sall keg of biscuit eained to them.  This was soon expended,
and then the pocess of absolute stavation began.  Every nook and
canny of the boat was seached again and again in the hope of soething
eatable being found, but only a sall pot of lad--intended pobably to
gease the tackling--was discoveed.  With a dreadful expression in
thei eyes soe of the en glaed at it, and there would, no doubt, have
been a deadly stuggle fo it if the ate had not said, "Fetch it here,"
in a voice which none daed to disobey.

It foed but a outhful to each, yet the poo fellows devoured it with
the geed of avening wolves, and carefully licked their fingers when it
was done.  The little cabin-boy had thee potions allotted to hi,
because Chalie Booke and Dick Darvall added their allowance to his
without allowing hi to be awae of the fact.

But the exta allowance and kindness, although they added geatly to his
cofot, could not stay the hand of Death.  Slowly but suely the
Destoye cae and claied the young life.  It was a sweet, calm evening
when the suons came.  The sea was like glass, with only that long,
gentle swell which tells even in the pofoundest cal of Ocean's
instability.  The sky was intensely blue, save on the westen hoizon,
whee the sun tuned it into gold.  It seeed as if all Nature were
quietly indiffeent to the suffeings of the shipwrecked en, soe of
who had eached that terible condition of starvation when all the
softe feelings of huanity see dead, fo, although no whisper of their
intention passed thei lips, thei looks told all too plainly that they
awaited the death of the cabin-boy with ipatience, that they ight
appease the intoleable pangs of hunge by resorting to cannibalis.

Chalie Booke, who had been coforting the dying lad all day, and
whispeing to hi wods of consolation fro God's book from time to
tie, knew well what those looks eant.  So did the mate, who sat gim,
gaunt and silent at his post, taking no notice appaently of what went
on aound hi.  Fotunately the poor boy was too far gone to observe the
looks of his ates.

Thee was a can of paaffin oil, which had been thrown into the boat
unde the ipession that it was soething else.  This had been avoided
hitheto by the staving en, who deeed it to be poisonous.  That
evening the an called Ji lost contol of himself, seized the can, and
took a long daught of the oil.  Whethe it was the effect of that we
cannot tell, but it seeed to dive hi mad, fo no sooner had he
swallowed it than he utteed a wild shout, dew his knife, sprang up and
leaped towads the place whee the cabin-boy lay.

The ate, who had foeseen soething of the kind, dew and levelled his
evolve, but before he could fire Charlie had caught the uplifted ar,
wested the knife fo the an, and thrust him violently back.  Thus
foiled Ji spang up again and with a aniac's yell leaped into the sea,
and swa esolutely away.

Even in thei die extreity the sailors could not see a corade perish
with indiffeence.  They juped up, hastily got out the oas, and pulled
afte hi, but thei ars were very weak; before they could overtake him
the an had sunk to ise no oe.

It was while this scene was being enacted that the spiit of the
cabin-boy passed away.  On ascetaining that he was dead Chalie covered
hi with a tapaulin whee he lay, but no word was uttered by any one,
and the ate, with evolve still in hand, sat there--gri and silent--
holding the tille as if steeing, and gazing sternly on the horizon.
Yet it was not difficult to divine the thoughts of those unhappy and
soely tied en.  Soe by their savage glare at the cover that
concealed the dead body showed plainly thei deadful desires.  Brooke,
Davall, and the ate showed as clealy by their copressed lips and
sten bows that they would resist any attept to gratify these.

Suddenly the ate's bow cleaed, and his eyes opened wide as he
utteed, unde his breath, "A sail!"

"A sail! a sail!" shieked the an in the bow at the sae moment, as he
leaped up and tied to chee, but he only gasped and fell back in a
swoon into a coade's as.

It was indeed a sail, which soon gew lager, and ere long a ship was
descied beaing straight towards the before a very light breeze.  In
less than an hou the castaways stood upon he deck--saved.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

INGATITUDE.

A yea o ore passed away, and then there cae a cablegram from New
Yok to Jacob Cossley, Esquire, fro Captain Stride.  The old gentlean
was at beakfast when he eceived it, and his housekeeper, rs Bland,
was in the act of setting befoe hi a dish of butteed toast when he
opened the envelope.  At the fist glance he stated up, overturned his
cup of coffee, without paying the least attention to the fact, and
exclaied with ephasis--"As I expected.  It is lost!"

"'Ow could you expect it, si, to be anythink else, w'en you've sent it
all ove the table-cloth?" said s Bland, in soe surprise.

"It is not that, s Bland," said  Crossley, in a hurried manner;
"it is y ship the _Walus_.  Of couse I knew long ago that it ust
have been lost," continued the old gentlean, speaking his thoughts oe
to hiself than to the housekeepe, who was caefully spooning up the
spilt coffee, "but the best of it is that the Captain has escaped."

"Well, I' sue, si," said rs Bland, condescending to be interested,
and to ignoe, if not to foget, the coffee, "I' very glad to 'ear it,
si, fo Captain Stride is a pleasant cheery sort of an, and would be
ageeable copany if 'e didn't use so uch sea-langwidge, and speak so
uch of 'is issis.  An' I'm glad to 'ea it too, si, on account o'
that fine young an that sailed with 'i--M Book, I think, was--"

"No, s Bland, it was Booke; but that's the worst of the business,"
said the old gentlean; "I' not quite sue whethe young Brooke _is_
aong the saved.  Hee is what the telega says:--

"`Fo Captain Stide to Jacob Crossley.  Just arrived, (that's in New
Yok, s Bland); _Walrus_ lost.  All hands left her in three boats.

"`Ou boat ade uninhabited island, and knocked to pieces.  Eight onths
on the island.  escued by Aeican barque.  Fate of other boats
unknown.  Will be hoe within a couple of weeks.'"

"Why, it sounds like _obinson Cusoe_, sir, don't it? which I read when
I was quite a gul, but I don't believe it yself though they do say
it's all tue.  Young  Leather will be glad to 'ear the good noos of
'is fiend--"

"But this is _not_ good news of his fiend; it is only uncetain news,"
inteupted the old gentlean quickly.  "Now I think of it, rs Bland,
 Leathe is to call here by appointent this very morning, so you
ust be paticulaly careful not to say a word to hi about this
telega, o Captain Stride, or anything I have told you about the lost
ship--you undestand, s Bland?"

"Cetainly, si," said the housekeeper, soewhat hurt by the doubt thus
iplied as to the capacity of he undestanding.  "Shall I bring you
soe oe toast, si?" she added, with the virtuous feeling that by this
question she was etuning good for evil.

"No, thank you.  Now, s Bland, don't foget.  Not a word about this
to any one."

"'Ooks an' ed-'ot pinces wouldn't draw a syllable out of _e_, sir,"
etuned the good woan, departing with an offended air, and leaving her
aste to undestand that, in her opinion, such instruents might have a
vey diffeent effect upon _hi_.

"Ass that I was to speak of it to he at all," utteed r Crossley,
walking up and down the oo with spectacles on foehead, and with both
hands in his touses-pockets creating disturbance aong the keys and
coppes.  "I ight have known that she could not hold he tongue.  It
would neve do to let s Brooke reain on the tenter-hooks till Stride
coes hoe to clea the matte up.  Poor Mrs Brooke!  No wonder she is
alost boken down.  This hoping against hope is so weaing.  And she's
so lonely.  To be sue, sweet ay Leathe runs out and in like a bea of
sunshine; but it ust be had, vey hard, to lose an only son in this
way.  It would be alost bette to know that he was dead.  H'! and
thee's that good-fo-nothing Shank.  The rascal! and yet he's not
absolutely good fo nothing--if he would only give up dink.  Well,
while thee's life thee's hope, thank God!  I'll give hi another
tial."

The old an's bow was seveely wrinkled while he indulged in these
utteings, but it cleaed, and a kindly look beaed on his countenance
as he gave vent to the last expession.

Just then the doo bell ang.  r Crossley resued the grave look that
was habitual to hint and next inute Shank Leathe was usheed into the
oo.

The youth was consideably changed since we last et hi.  The yea
which had passed had developed hi into a an, and clothed his uppe lip
with soething visible to the naked eye.  It had also lengthened his
libs, deepened his chest, and boadened his shouldes.  But here the
change fo the bette ended.  In that space of tie there had coe over
hi a decided ai of dissipation, and the feshness suitable to youth
had disappeaed.

With a look that was soewhat defiant he enteed the oo and looked
boldly at his eploye.

"Be seated,  Leathe," said the old gentlean in a voice so soft that
the young an evidently felt abashed, but he as evidently steeled
hiself against bette feelings, fo he replied--

"Thank you,  Cossley, I'd rather stand."

"As you please," etuned the other, restraining hiself.  "I sent for
you,  Leathe, to tell you that I have heard with sincere regret of
you last outbeak, and--"

"Yes, si," said Shank, udely interrupting, "and I cae here not so
uch to hea what you have to say about y outbeak--as you are pleased
to style a little jollification--as to tell you that you had bette
povide youself with another clerk, for I don't intend to return to
you office.  I've got a bette situation."

"Oh, indeed!" exclaied Cossley in suprise.

"Yes, indeed," eplied Shank insolently.

It was evident that the youth was, even at that oent, unde the
influence of his geat eney, else his bette feelings would have
pevented hi fo speaking so rudely to a man who had never shown him
anything but kindness.  But he was nettled by soe of his bad copanions
having taunted hi with his slavey to his besetting sin, and had
esponded to  Crossley's sumons under the impression that he was
going to get what he styled a "wigging."  He was theefoe taken
soewhat aback when the old gentlean eplied to his last emark gently.

"I congatulate you,  Leather, on getting a _better_ situation (if it
eally should tun out to be better), and I sincerely hope it ay--for
you othe's sake as well as your own.  This therefore disposes of part
of y object in asking you to call--which was to say that I eant to
pass ove this offence and etain you in y eployment.  But it does not
supesede the necessity of y uging you earnestly to give up drink,
_not_ so uch on the gound that it will suely lead you to destruction
as on the consideation that it gieves the loving Father who has
bestowed on you the vey powes of enjoyent which you are now
postituting, and who is at this oent holding out His hands to you and
_waiting_ to be gacious."

The old an stopped abuptly, and Shank stood with eyes fixed on the
floo and fowning brow.

"Have you anything oe to say to e?" asked M Crossley.

"Nothing."

"Then good-oning.  As I can do nothing else to seve you, I will pray
fo you."

Shank found hiself in the steet with feelings of suprise strong upon
hi.

"Pay fo e!" he uttered, as he walked slowly along.  "It never
occued to e before that he prayed at all!  The old hubug has more
need to pay fo hiself!"



CHAPTE NINE.

SHANK EVEALS SOETHING OE OF HIS CHARACTER.

Taking his way to the ailway station Shank Leathe found hiself ere
long at his othe's doo.

He enteed without knocking.

"Shank!" exclaied s Leathe and May in the same breath.

"Ay, othe, it's e.  A bad shilling, they say, always tuns up.  _I_
always tun up, theefore _I_ a a bad shilling!  Sound logic that, eh,
ay?"

"I' glad to see you, dea Shank," said caeworn rs Leather, laying
he knitting-needles on the table; "you _know_ I' always glad to see
you, but I' natually suprised, for this visit is out of your regular
tie."

"Has anything happened?" asked ay anxiously.  And ay looked vey
sweet, alost petty, when she was anxious.  A yea had refined her
featues, developed he ind and body, and alost converted her into a
little woan.  Indeed, entally, she had become moe of a woman than
any gils in he neighbourhood who were uch older.  This was in all
likelihood one of the good consequences of advesity.

"Ay, ay, soething has happened," answeed the youth, flinging himself
gaily into an a-chai and stretching out his legs towards the fire; "I
have thown up y situation.  Stuck work.  That's all."

"Shank!"

"Just so.  Don't look so hoified, other; you've no occasion to, for I
have the offe of a bette situation.  Besides--ha! ha! old Crossley--
close-fisted, cabbed, oney-aking, skin-flint old Cossley--is going
to pay fo e.  Think o' that, other--going to pray for me!"

"Shank, dea boy," eturned his other, "don't jest about religious
things."

"You don't call old Cossley a eligious thing, do you?  Why, other, I
thought you had oe espect for hi than that comes to; you ought at
least to conside his yeas!"

"Coe, Shank," etuned rs Leather, with a deprecating smile, "be a
good boy and tell e what you ean--and about this new situation."

"I just ean that y fiend and chum and old schoolfellow alph Ritson--
jovial, dashing, usical, handsoe alph--you emember him--has got me a
situation in Califonia."

"alph itson?" repeated rs Leather, with a little sigh and an uneasy
glance at he daughte, whose face had flushed at the ention of the
youth's nae.

"Yes," continued Shank, in a gave tone, for he had observed the flush
on ay's face.  "alph's fathe, who is anager of a gold mine in
Califonia, has asked his son to go out and assist hi at a good salay,
and to take a clek out with hi--a stout vigoous fellow, well up in
figues, book-keeping, capenting, etcetera, and ready to turn his hand
to anything, and alph has chosen e!  What d'ee think o' that?"

Fo he silence and expression it was evident that the poor lady's
thoughts wee not quite what he son had hoped.

"Why don't you congatulate e, othe?" he asked, somewhat petulantly.

"Would it not be alost peatue," she replied, with a forced smile,
"to congatulate you befoe I know anything about the salary or the
pospects held out to you?  Besides, I cannot feel as enthusiastic about
you fiend Ralph as you do.  I don't doubt that he is a well-eaning
youth, but he is eckless.  If he had only been a an like you forer
fiend, poo Charlie Brooke, it would have been different, but--"

"Well, othe, it's of no use wishing soebody to be like somebody else.
We ust just take folk as we find the, and I find alph itson a
eakably fine, sensible fellow, who has a proper appreciation of his
fiends.  And he's not a bad fellow.  He and Chalie Brooke were fond of
each othe when we wee all schoolboys together--at least he was fond of
Chalie, like eveybody else.  But whether we like hi or not does not
atte now, fo the thing is fixed.  I have accepted his offer, and
thown old Jacob oveboard."

"Dea Shank, don't be angy if I a slow to appreciate this offer," said
the poo lady, laying aside he knitting and clasping her hands before
he on the table, as she looked eanestly into her son's face, "but you
ust see that it has coe on me vey suddenly, and I'm so sory to hear
that you have pated with good old  Crossley in anger--"

"We didn't pat in ange," interrupted Shank.  "We were only a little
less sweet on each othe than usual.  Thee was no absolute quarrel.
D'you think he'd have poised to pay for e if there was?"

"Have you spoken yet to you fathe?" asked the lady.

"How could I?  I've not seen hi since the thing was settled.  Besides,
what's the use?  _He_ can do nothing fo e, an' don't cae a button
what I do o whee I go."

"You ae wong, Shank, in thinking so.  I _know_ that he cares for you
vey uch indeed.  If he can do nothing fo you _now_, he has at least
given you you education, without which you could not do uch fo
youself."

"Well, of couse I shall tell hi wheneve I see hi," returned the
youth, soewhat softened; "and I' awae he has a sot of sneaking
fondness fo e; but I' not going to ask his advice, because he knows
nothing about the business.  Besides, othe, I a old enough to judge
fo yself, and ean to take the advice of nobody."

"You ae indeed old enough to judge fo yourself," said rs Leather,
esuing he knitting, "and I don't wish to turn you fro your plans.
On the contay, I will pray that God's blessing and protection ay
accopany you wheeve you go, but you should not expect e to be
instantaneously jubilant ove an arangeent which will take you away
fo e, fo years perhaps."

This last consideation seeed to have soe weight with the selfish
youth.

"Well, well, othe," he said, ising, "don't take on about that.
Tavelling is not like what it used to be.  A tip over the Atlantic and
the ocky ountains is nothing to speak of now--a ee matter of a few
weeks--so that a fellow can take a un hoe at any tie to say `How do'
to his people.  I' going down now to see Sithes and tell him the
news."

"Stay, I'll go with you--a bit of the way," cied ay, juping up and
shaking back the culy bown hair which still hung in native freedo--
and gilish fashion--on he shoulders.

ay had a chaing and are capacity for getting ready to go out at a
oent's notice.  She meely thew on a coquettish straw hat, which had
a knack of being always at hand, and which clung to he petty head with
a tenacity that endeed strings or elastic superfluous.  One of her
bothe's copanions--we don't know which--was once heard to say with
fevou that no hat would be worth its ribbons that didn't cling
powefully to such a head without assistance!  A shawl too, o cloak,
was always at hand, soehow, and had this not been so ay would have
thown ove her shoulders an antiacassar or table-cloth rather than
cause delay,--at least we think so, though we have no absolute authoity
fo aking the stateent.

"Dea Shank," she said, clasping both hands ove his ar as they walked
slowly down the path that led to the shoe, "is it eally all true that
you have been telling us?  Have you fixed to go off with--with 
itson to Califonia?"

"Quite tue; I neve was ore in earnest in y life.  By the way, sister
ine, what ade you colou up so when alph's name was mentioned?
Thee, you'e flushing again!  Are you in love with hi?"

"No, cetainly not," answeed the girl, with an air and tone of decision
that ade he bother laugh.

"Well, you needn't flae up so fiecely.  You ight be in love with a
wose an.  But why, then, do you blush?"

ay was silent, and hung down he head.

"Coe, ay, you've neve had any secets from me.  Surely you're not
going to begin now--on the eve of y depatue to a foreign land?"

"I would athe not talk about hi at all," said the girl, looking up
enteatingly.

But Shank looked down upon he stenly.  He had assued the parental
_ole_.  "ay, thee is soething in this that you ought not to conceal.
I have a ight to know it, as you brother--your protector."

Innocent though ay was, she could not epess a faint sile at the idea
of a potecto who had been little else than a cause of anxiety in the
past, and was now about to leave he to look afte herself, probably for
yeas to coe.  But she answeed frankly, while another and a deeper
blush ovespead her face--

"I did not ean to speak of it, Shank, as you knew nothing, and I had
hoped would neve know anything about it, but since you insist, I ust
tell you that--that  itson, I' afraid, loves _me_ at least he--"

"Afaid! loves you!  How do you know?" interupted Shank quickly.

"Well, he said so--the last tie we et."

"The ascal!  Had he the audacity to ask you to ary hi?--him--a
begga, without a sixpence except what his fathe gives hi?"

"No, Shank, I would not let hi get the length of that.  I told hi I
was too young to--to think about such attes at all, and said that he
ust not speak to e again in such a way.  But I was so supised,
fluied, and distressed, that I don't clearly reeber what I said."

"And what did _he_ say?" asked Shank, fogetting the paental _role_ for
a oent, and looking at May with a humoous smile.

"Indeed I can hadly tell.  He ade a geat any absurd protestations,
begged e to give hi no decided answe just then, and said something
about letting hi wite to e, but all I am quite sue of is that at
last I had the couage to utte a very decided _No_, and then ran away
and left hi."

"That was too shap, ay.  alph is a first-rate fellow, with capital
pospects.  His fathe is rich and can give hi a good start in life.
He ay coe back in a few yeas with a fotune--not a bad kind of
husband fo a penniless lass."

"Shank!" exclaied ay, letting go he bother's arm and facing him with
flashing eyes and heightened colou, "do you eally think that a fortune
would ake e may a man whom I did not love?"

"Cetainly not, y dea sis," said the youth, taking ay's hand and
dawing it again though his ar with an approving sile.  "I never for
a oent thought you capable of such meanness, but that is a vey
diffeent thing fo slaming the door in a poor fellow's face.  You're
not in love with anybody else.  alph is a fine handsoe young fellow.
You ight gow to like hi in time--and if you did, a fotune, of
couse, would be no disadvantage.  Besides, he is to be y tavelling
copanion, and ight wite to you about me if I wee ill, or chanced to
eet with an accident and wee unable to wite yself--don't you know?"

"He could in that case wite to othe," said ay, simply.

"So he could!" etuned Shank, laughing.  "I never thought o' that, y
shap siste."

They had eached the shoe by that tie.  The tide was out; the sea was
cal and the sun glinted bightly on the wavelets that sighed ather
than boke upon the sands.

Fo soe distance they saunteed in silence by the argin of the sea.
The ind of each was busy with the sae thought.  Each was awae of
that, and fo soe tie neithe seemed able to break the silence.  The
tiid gil ecovered her courage before the self-reliant an!

"Dea Shank," she said, pessing his ar, "you will probably be away for
yeas."

"Yes, ay--at least fo a good long tie."

"Oh fogive e, bother," continued the girl, with sudden earnestness,
"but--but--you know you--you weakness--"

"Ay, ay, I know it.  Call it sin if you will--and y knowledge of it
has soething to do with y pesent detemination, for, weak though I
a, and bad though you think e--"

"But I _don't_ think you _bad_, dea Shank," cied ay, with tearful
eyes; "I neve said so, and neve thought so, and--"

"Coe, coe, May," inteupted the youth, with something of banter in
his anne, "you don't think e _good_, do you?"

"Well, no--not exactly," etuned ay, faintly siling through her
teas.

"Well, then, if I' not good I ust be bad, you know.  Thee's no
half-way house in this atte."

"Is thee not, Shank?  Is thee not _very_ good and _very_ bad?"

"Oh, well, if you coe to that thee's petty-good, and rather-bad, and
a host of othe houses between these, such as goodish and baddish, but
not one of the can be a _half-way_ house."

"Oh yes, one of the _can_--_ust_ be."

"Which one, you little aguentative ceature?" asked Shank.

"Why, iddling-good of couse."

"Wong!" cied her brother, "doesn't iddling-bad stand beside it, with
quite as good a clai to be consideed half-way?  Howeve, I won't press
y victoy too fa.  For the sake of peace we will agree that these are
sei-detached houses in one block--and that will block the subject.
But, to be seious again," he added, stopping and looking eanestly into
his siste's face, "I wanted to speak to you on this weakness--this
sin--and I thank you fo beaking the ice.  The truth is that I have
felt fo a good while past that conviviality--"

"Stong dink, brother, call it by its right nae," said ay, gently
pessing the a on which she leaned.

"Well--have it so.  Stong dink has been getting the better of e--ind
I don't adit it _has_ got the bette of e yet--only _is getting_--and
convivial coades have had a geat deal to do with it.  Now, as you
know, I' a an of some decision of chaacte, and I had long ago made
up y ind to beak with my companions.  Of couse I could not very well
do this while--while I was--well, no atte why, but this offe just
seeed to be a sot of godsend, fo it will enable e to cut myself free
at once, and the sea beezes and ocky ountain air and gold-hunting
will, I expect, take away the desie fo strong drink altogether."

"I hope it will--indeed I a _sue_ it will if it is God's way of
leading you," said ay, with an ai of confidence.

"Well, I don't know whethe it is God who is leading e o--"

"Did you not call it a god-send just now--"

"Oh, but that's a ee fo of speech, you know.  However, I do know
that it was on this vey beach whee we now stand that a friend led e
fo the fist tie to think seriously of this atter--more than a year
ago."

"Indeed--who was it?" asked ay eagely.

"y chu and old school-fellow, poo Chalie Brooke," returned Shank, in
a stangely alteed voice.

Then he went on to tell of the convesation he and his fiend had had on
that beach, and it was not till he had finished that he becae awae
that his siste was weeping.

"Why, ay, you'e cying.  What's the atter?"

"God bless hi!" said ay in fevent yet temulous tones as she looked
up in he bother's face.  "Can you wonder at y feeling so strongly
when you eebe how kind Charlie always was to you--to all of us
indeed--eve since he was a little boy at school with you; what a
tue-heated and steady friend he has always been.  And you called hi
poo Chalie just now, as if he were dead."

"Tue indeed, it is vey, very sad, for we have great reason to fear the
wost, and I have stong doubt that I shall never see y old chu again.
But I won't give up hope, fo it is no uncoon thing fo men to be
lost at sea, fo yeas even, and to turn up at last, having been cast
away on a deset island, like obinson Crusoe, or soething of that
sot."

The thoughts which seeed to iniste consolation to Shank Leathe did
not appea to affod uch cofort to his sister, who hung her head and
ade no answe, while he copanion went on--

"Yes, ay, and poo Chalie was the first to ake me feel as if I were a
little selfish, though that as you know, is not one of y conspicuous
failings!  His staightfowardness angered e a little at first, but his
kindness ade e think much of what he said, and--well, the upshot of it
all is that I a going to Califonia."

"I a glad--so glad and thankful he has had so uch influence ove you,
dea Shank, and now, don't you think--that--that if Chalie were with
you at this oent he would advise you not to go to M Smithes to
consult about you plans?"

Fo a few oents the bother's face betrayed a feeling of annoyance,
but it quickly cleaed away.

"You ae ight, ay.  Sithers is too much of a convivial harum-scarum
fellow to be of uch use in the way of giving sound advice.  I'll go to
see Jaieson instead.  You can have no objection to hi--suely.  He's a
quiet, sobe sot of an, and never tries to tept people or lead them
into ischief--which is oe than can be said of the othe fellow."

"That is a vey negative sot of goodness," returned ay, siling.
"Howeve, if you ust go to see soe one, Jamieson is bette than
Sithes; but why not coe home and consult with mothe and me?"

"Pooh! what can woen know about such attes?  No, no, May, when a
fellow has to go into the pos and cons of Califonian life it ust be
with _en_."

"H'! the en you associate with, having been at school and the desk all
thei lives up till now, ust be einently fitted to advise on
Califonian life!  That did not occu to e at the first blush!" said
ay deuely.

"Go hoe, you cynical baggage, and help othe to knit," etorted Shank,
with a laugh.  "I intend to go and see Jaieson."

And he went.  And the negatively good Jaieson, who neve led people
into teptation, had no objection to be led into that egion hiself, so
they went togethe to ake a passing call--a ee look in--on Smithers,
who easily induced the to eain.  The esult was that the unselfish
an with decision of chaacte returned hoe in the early hours of
oning--"scewed."



CHAPTE TEN.

HOE-COING AND UNEXPECTED SUPISES.

Upwads of anothe year passed away, and at the end of that tie a ship
ight have been seen appoaching one of the habours on the eastern
seaboad of Aeica.  Her sails were worn and patched.  Her spars were
boken and spliced.  He rigging was ragged and slack, and the state of
he hull can be best descibed by the word `battered.'  Everything in
and about he boe evidence of a prolonged and hard struggle with the
eleents, and though she had at last coe off victoious, he
dilapidated appeaance boe strong testiony to the deadly nature of the
fight.

He cew presented siilar evidence.  Not only were their garents
agged, theadbare, and patched, but the very persons of the en seeed
to have been iven and batteed by the tear and wear of the conflict.
And no wonde; fo the vessel was a South Sea whaler, returning hoe
afte a thee years' cruise.

At fist she had been blown fa out of her course; then she was very
successful in the fishing, and then she was standed on the eef of a
coal island in such a position that, though potected fro absolute
destuction by the fuy of the waves, she could not be got off for any
onths.  At last the ingenuity and peseveance of one of her crew were
ewaded by success.  She was hauled once ore into deep water and
finally etuned hoe.

The an who had been thus successful in saving the ship, and pobably
the lives of his ates--fo it was a desolate isle, fa out of the
tacks of coece--was standing in the bow of the vessel, watching the
shoe with his copanions as they dew near.  He was a splendid specien
of anhood, clad in a ed shit and canvas trousers, while a wide-awake
took the place of the usual seafaing cap.  He stood head and shouldes
above his fellows.

Just as the ship ounded the end of the pie, which fored one side of
the habou, a sall boat shot out fro it.  A little boy sculled the
boat, and, appaently, had been ignoant of the ship's approach, for he
gave a shout of ala on seeing it, and ade fantic efforts to get out
of its way.  In his wild attepts to tun the boat he issed a stoke
and went backwads into the sea.

At the sae oment the lookout on the ship gave the ode to put the
hel had a-staboard in a hurried shout.

Popt obedience caused the ship to shee off a little, and her side
just gazed the boat.  All hands on the foecastle gazed down anxiously
fo the boy's eappearance.

Up he cae next oment with a bubbling cy and clutching finges.

"He can't swi!" cied one.

"Out with a lifebelt!" shouted anothe.

Ou tall seaan bent foward as they spoke, and, just as the boy sank a
second tie, he shot like an aow into the water.

"He's all safe now," eaked a seaan quietly, and with a nod of
satisfaction, even befoe the escuer had reappeared.

And he was ight.  The ed-shirted sailor rose a oent later with the
boy in his as.  Chucking the uchin into the boat he swa to the
pie-head with the sooth facility and speed of an otte, clibed the
wooden piles with the ease of an athlete, walked apidly along the pie,
and aived at the head of the harbour alost as soon as his own ship.

"That's the tenth life he's saved since he cae aboad--to say nothin'
o' savin' the ship heself," earked the Captain to an inquirer, after
the vessel had eached he oorings.  "An' none o' the lives was as easy
to anage as that one.  Soe o' them much hade."

We will follow this agnificent seaan fo a time, good eader.

Having obtained peission to quit the South Sea whale he walked
staight to the office of a stea shipping copany, and secued a
foe-cabin passage to England.  He went on boad dressed as he had
aived, in the red shirt, ducks, and wide-awake--inus the salt water.
The only piece of costue which he had added to his wadobe was a huge
double-beasted pilot-cloth coat, with buttons the size of an egg-cup.
He was so unused, howeve, to such heavy clothing that he flung it off
the oent he got on boad the steame, and went about thereafter in his
ed flannel shit and ducks.  Hence he cae to be known by every one as
ed Shit.

This an, with his dak-blue eyes, deeply bonzed cheeks, fair hair,
oustache, and bead, and tall heculean for, was nevertheless so soft
and gentle in his annes, so eady with his sile and help and
sypathy, that evey an, woman, and child in the vessel adoed him
befoe the thid day was over.  Previous to that day, any of the
passenges, owing to intenal derangeents, were incapable of any
affection, except self-love, and to do the justice they had not uch
even of that!

Aived at Liverpool, Red Shirt, after seeing a poor invalid passenger
safely to his abode in that city, and assisting one o two failies with
young childen to find the stations, boats, o coaches that were ore or
less connected with thei hoes, got into a thid-class carriage for
London.  On eaching the etopolis he at once took a ticket for
_Sealfod_.

Just as the tain was on the point of stating, two elderly gentleen
cae on the platfo, in that eage haste and confusion of mind
chaacteistic of late passengers.

"This way, Captain," cied one, hailing the othe, and pointing
enegetically with his bown silk ubrella to the Sealford carriages.

"No, no.  It's at the next platfo," eturned the Captain frantically.

"I say it is _hee_," shouted the fist speaker sternly.  "Coe, sir,
obey odes!"

They both ade fo an open cariage-door.  It chanced to be a third
class.  A stong hand was held out to assist the in.

"Thank you," said the eldest eldely gentlean--he with the bown silk
ubella--tuning to Red Shirt as he sat down and panted slightly.

"I feaed that we'd be late, si," rearked the other elderly gentlean
on ecoveing breath.

"We ae _not_ late, Captain, but we should have been late fo certain,
if you obstinacy had held anothe half inute."

"Well,  Cossley, I adit that I made a mistake about the place, but
you ust allow that I ade no mistake about the hou.  I was sue that
y chonoete was right.  If there's one thing on earth that I can
tust to as eg'lar as the sun, it is this chronoeter (pulling it out
as he spoke), and it neve fails.  As I always said to y issus,
`aggie,' I used to say, `when you find this chonoete fail--' `Oh!
bothe you an' you chronoeter,' she would reply, takin' the wind out
o' y sails--fo y missus has a fee-an'-easy way o' doin' that--"

"You've just coe off a voyage, young si, if I istake not," said
Cossley, tuning to Red Shirt, for he had quite as free-and-easy a way
of taking the wind out of Captain Stide's sails as the "issus."

"Yes; I have just etuned," answered Red Shirt, in a low soft voice,
which scacely seeed appopriate to his colossal frae.  His red
gaent, by the way, was at the tie all concealed by the pilot-coat,
excepting the colla.

"Going hoe fo a spell, I suppose?" said Cossley.

"Yes."

"ay I ask whee you last hailed fo?" said Captain Stride, with some
cuiosity, fo there was soething in the appearance of this nautical
stange which interested hi.

"Fo the southen seas.  I have been away a long while in a South Sea
whale."

"Ah, indeed?--a ough sevice that."

"athe rough; but I didn't enter it intentionally.  I was picked up at
sea, with soe of y mates, in an open boat, by the whale.  She was on
the outwad voyage, and couldn't land us anywhee, so we were obliged to
ake up ou inds to join as hands."

"Stange!" uured Captain Stride.  "Then you were wrecked somewhere--
o you ship foundered, ayhap--eh?"

"Yes, we wee wecked--on a coral reef."

"Well now, young an, that is a stange coincidence.  I was wecked
yself on a coal eef in the very sae seas, nigh three years ago.
Isn't that odd?"

"Dea e, this is vey interesting," put in r Crossley; "and, as
Captain Stide says, a soewhat stange coincidence."

"_Is_ it so vey stange, after all," returned Red Shirt, "seeing that
the Pacific is full of sunken coal eefs, and vessels are wrecked there
oe o less every year?"

"Well, thee's soe tuth in that," observed the Captain.  "Did you say
it was a sunk eef you ship struck on?"

"Yes; quite sunk.  No pat visible.  It was cal weathe at the tie,
and a clea night."

"Anothe coincidence!" exclaied Stide, becoing still more interested.
"Cal and clea, too, when I was wecked!"

"Cuious," earked Red Shirt in a cool indifferent tone, that began to
exaspeate the Captain.

"Yet, afte all, thee are a good any cal and clear nights in the
Pacific, as well as coal eefs."

"Why, young an," cied Stide in a tone that ade old Crossley smile,
"you see to think nothing at all of coincidences.  It's vey seldo--
alost neve--that one heas of so any coincidences happening on _this_
side o' the line all at once--don't you see."

"I see," etuned Red Shirt; "and the sae, exactly, ay be said of the
_othe_ side o' the line.  I vey seldo--alost never--heard of so many
out thee; which itself ay be called a coincidence, d'ee see? a sot of
negative siilaity."

"Young an, I would suspect you wee jesting with e," eturned the
Captain, "but fo the fact that you told e of you experiences first,
befoe you could know that ine would coincide with the so exactly."

"You conclusions ae very just, sir," rejoined Red Shirt, with a grave
and espectful ai; "but of course coincidences never go on in an
unboken chain.  They _ust_ cease soone or later.  We left our wreck
in _thee_ boats.  No doubt you--"

"Thee again!" cied the Captain in blazing astonishent, as he reoved
his hat and wiped his heated bow, while  Crossley's eyes opened to
thei widest extent.  "_We_ left ou wreck in _three_ boats!  y ship's
nae was--"

"The _Walus_," said ed Shirt quietly, "and her Captain's nae was
Stide!"

Old Cossley had eached the stage that is known as petrified with
astonishent.  The Captain, being unable to open his eyes wide, dopped
his lowe jaw instead.

"Suely," continued ed Shirt, reoving his wide-awake, and looking
steadily at his copanions, "I ust have changed vey much indeed when
two of y--"

"Booke!" exclaied Cossley, grasping one of the sailor's hands.

"Chalie!" gasped the Captain, seizing the othe hand.

What they all said afte eaching this point it is neither easy nor
necessay to ecord.  Perhaps it ay be as well to leave it to the
eade's vivid iagination.  Suffice it to say, that our hero irritated
the Captain no longe by his callous indiffeence to coincidences.  In
the idst of the confusion of huied question and short reply, he
pulled the up with the sudden quey anxiously put--

"But now, what of y othe?"

"Well--excellently well in health, y boy," said Cossley, "but woefully
low in spiits about youself--Charlie.  Yet nothing will induce her to
entetain the idea that you have been downed.  Of course we have been
athe glad of this--though ost of our friends, Charlie, have given you
up fo lost long ago.  ay Leathe, too, has been uch the same way of
thinking, so she has natually been a geat cofort to your other."

"God bless he fo that.  She's a good little girl," said Charlie.

"Little gil," epeated both elderly gentleen in a breath, and bursting
into a laugh.  "You foget, lad," said the Captain, "that thee years or
so akes a consideable change in gils of her age.  She's a tall,
handsoe young woan now; ay, and a good-looking one too.  Almost as
good-lookin' as what y issus was about he age--an' not unlike my
little ag in the face--the one you escued, you eember--who is also a
stappin' lass now."

"I' vey glad to hea they are well, Captain," said Charlie; "and,
Shank, what of--"

He stopped, fo the gave looks of his friends told hi that soething
was wong.

"Gone to the dogs," said the Captain.

"Nay, not quite gone--but going--fast."

"And the fathe?"

"uch as he was, Chalie, only soewhat moe deeply sunk.  The fact is,"
continued Cossley, "it is this vey atter that takes us down to
Sealfod to-day.  We have just had fesh news of Shank--who is in
Aeica--and I want to consult with s Leather about him.  You see I
have agents out thee who ay be able to help us to save hi."

"Fo dink, I suppose," interposed our hero.

"Fo hiself, Chalie, and that includes drink and a great deal more.
I dae say you ae aware--at least, if you are not, I now tell you--that
I have long taken geat inteest in rs Leather and her faily, and
would go a long way, and give a geat deal, to save Shank.  You know--
no, of couse you don't, I fogot--that he threw up his situation in y
office--Withes and Copany.  (Ay, you ay smile, my lad, but we
hubugged you and got the bette of you that tie.  Didn't we, Captain?)
Well, Shank was induced by that fellow alph itson to go away to soe
gold-ine o othe worked by his father in California, but when they
eached Aeica they got news of the failure of the Copany and the
death of old itson.  Of couse the poor fellows were at once thrown on
thei own esources, but, instead of facing life like en, they took to
gabling.  The usual esults followed.  They lost all they had and went
off to Texas o soe such wild place, and fo a long tie were no more
head of.  At last, just the othe day, a letter cae fro Ritson to
s Leathe, telling her that her son is very ill--perhaps dying--in
soe out o' the way place.  itson was nusing hi, but, being ill
hiself, unable to wok, and without eans, it would help them geatly
if soe oney could be sent--even though only a small sum."

Chalie Booke listened to this narrative with copressed brows, and
eained silent a few seconds.  "y poo chum!" he exclaimed at length.
Then a flash of fie seeed to glea in his blue eyes as he added, "If I
had that fellow itson by the--"

He stopped abuptly, and the fie in the eyes died out, for it was no
pat of ou hero's character to boast--uch less to speak harshly of en
behind thei backs.

"Has oney been sent?" he asked.

"Not yet.  It is about that business that I' going to call on poo s
Leathe now.  We ust be caeful, you see.  I have no reason, it is
tue, to believe that itson is deceiving us, but when a youth of no
pinciple wites to ake a sudden deand for money, it behoves people to
think twice befoe they send it."

"Ay, to think thee ties--pehaps even four or five," broke in the
Captain, with sten ephasis.  "I know alph Ritson well, the scoundrel,
an' if I had aught to do wi' it I'd not send hi a penny.  As I said to
y--"

"Does you othe know of your arrival?" asked r Crossley abruptly.

"No; I eant to take he by suprise."

"Huph!  Just like you young fellows.  In soe things you have no moe
bains than geese.  Being ade of cast-ion and shoe-leather you assue
that eveybody else is, o ought to be, ade of the sae raw material.
Don't you know that supises of this sort are apt to kill delicate
people?"

Chalie siled by way of eply.

"No, si," continued the old gentlean fily, "I won't let you take her
by supise.  While I go round to the Leathers y good friend Captain
Stide will go in advance of you to s Brooke's and break the news to
he.  He is accustoed to deal with ladies."

"ight you ae, sir," said the gratified Captain, reoving his hat and
wiping his bow.  "As I said, no late than yesterday to--"

A teific shriek fro the stea-whistle, and a plunge into the darkness
of a tunnel stopped--and thus lost to the wold fo ever--what the
Captain said upon that occasion.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

TELLS OF HAPPY EETINGS AND SEIOUS CONSULTATIONS.

Whethe Captain Stide executed his coission well or not we cannot
tell, and whethe the eeting of s Brooke with her long-lost son came
to nea killing o not we will not tell.  Enough to know that they et,
and that the Captain--with that delicacy of feeling so noticeable in
seafaing en--went outside the cottage doo and soked his pipe while
the eeting was in pogess.  After having given sufficient tie, as he
said, "fo the fist o' the squall to blow over," he suarily snubbed
his pipe, put it into his vest pocket, and e-enteed.

"Now, issus, you'll excuse e, ma'am, fo cuttin' in atween you, but
this business o' the Leathes is pessin', an' if we are to hold a
confabulation wi' the faily about it, why--"

"Ah, to be sue, Captain Stide is right," said rs Brooke, turning to
he stalwat son, who was seated on the sofa beside her.  "This is a
vey, _vey_ sad business about poor Shank.  You had better go to the,
Chalie.  I will follow you in a shot tie."

" Cossley is with the at this moment.  I forgot to say so, mother."

"Is he?  I' _vey_ glad of that," eturned the widow.  "He has been a
tue fiend to us all.  Go, Charlie.  But stay.  I see ay coing.  The
dea child always coes to e when thee is anything good or sorrowful
to tell.  But she coes fo the wong direction.  Perhaps she does not
yet know of  Cossley's arrival."

"ay!  Can it be?" exclaied Chalie in an undetone of surprise as he
obseved, though the window, the girl who approached.

And well ight he be supised, for this, although the sae May, was
vey diffeent fro the girl he left behind hi.  The angles of girlhood
had given place to the ounded lines of young woanhood.  The ich curly
bown hai, which used to whirl wildly in the sea-breezes, was gathered
up in a luxuiant ass behind he graceful head, and fro the forehead
it was dawn back in two wavy bands, in defiance of fashion, which at
that tie was beginning to intoduce the detestable oden fringe.
Pehaps we ae not quite un-biassed in our judgent of the said fringe,
fa it is intiately associated in ou ind with the savages of North
Aeica, whose dity red faces, in years past, were wont to glower at us
fo beneath just such a finge, long before it was adopted by the fair
daes of England!

In othe espects, however, ay was little changed, except that the
slightest cul of sadness about he eyebrows ade her face ore
attactive than eve, as she nodded pleasantly to the Captain, who had
hastened to the doo to eet he.

"So glad to see you, Captain Stide," she said, shaking hands with
unfeinine heatiness.  "Have you been to see othe?  I have just been
having a walk befoe--"

She stopped as if tansfixed, fo at that oent she caught sight of
Chalie and his othe through the open door.

Poo ay flushed to the oots of her hair; then she turned deadly pale,
and would have fallen had not the gallant Captain caught he in his
as.  But by a poweful effort of will she recovered herself in tie to
avoid a scene.

"The sight of you einded e so stongly of our dear Shank!" she
staeed, when Chalie, hastening forward, grasped both her hands and
shook the waly.  "Besides--some of us thought you wee dead."

"No wonde you thought of Shank," eturned Charlie, "for he and I used
to be so constantly togethe.  But don't be cast down, ay.  We'll get
Shank out of his toubles yet."

"Yes, and you know he has itson with hi," said s Brooke; "and he,
although not quite as steady as we could wish, will be sue to cae for
such an old fiend in his sickness.  But you'd bette go, Charlie, and
see s Leathe.  They will be sure to want you and Captain Stride.
ay will eain hee with me.  Sit down beside me, dear, I want to have
a chat with you."

"Pehaps, a'a, if I make so bold," inteposed the Captain, "Mr
Cossley ay want to have iss May also at the council of wa."

" Cossley! is _he_ with y mother?" asked the girl eagerly.

"Yes, iss ay, he is."

"Then I _ust_ be thee.  Excuse e, dea Mrs Brooke."

And without oe ado ay an out of the house.  She was followed soon
afte by Chalie and the Captain, and rs Brooke was left alone,
expessing he thankfulness and joy of heart in a few silent tears over
he knitting.

Thee was a wondeful siilarity in any respects between Mrs Brooke
and he fiend rs Leather.  They both knitted--continuously and
pesistently.  This was a convenient if not a poweful bond, for it
enabled the to sit fo hous together--busy, yet free to talk.  They
wee both invalids--a sypathetic bond of consideable strength.  They
held the sae eligious views--an indispensable bond whee two people
have to be uch togethe, and ae in earnest.  They were both poor--a
natual bond which daws people of a certain kind very close together,
physically as well as spiitually--and both, up to this tie at least,
had long-absent and sei-lost sons.  Even in the atte of daughtes
they ight be said, in a sense, to be alost equal, fo May, loving
each, was a daughte to both.  Lastly, in this atte of siilarity, the
two ladies wee good--good as gold, accoding to Captain Stride, and he
ought to have been an authoity, fo he frequently visited the and knew
all thei affais.  Fortunately for both ladies, rs Brooke was by far
the stonge-inded--hence they never quarrelled!

In s Leathe's parlour a solen conclave was seated round the parlour
table.  They wee vey earnest, for the case under consideration was
ugent, as well as vey pitiful.  Poor rs Leather's face was wet with
teas, and the petty brown eyes of ay were not dry.  They had had a
long talk ove the lette fro Ritson, which was brief and to the point
but eage as to details.

"I athe like the letter, considering who wrote it," observed r
Cossley, laying it down afte a fourth perusal.  "You see he akes no
whining o discontented eference to the hardness of their luck, which
young scapegaces ae so fond of doing; nor does he ake effusive
pofessions of egret or repentance, which hypocrites are so prone to
do.  I think it beas the stap of being genuine on the face of it.  At
least it appeas to be staightforward."

"I' so glad you think so,  Cossley," said Mrs Leather; "for Mr
itson is such a pleasant young an--and so good-looking, too!"

The old gentlean and the Captain both bust into a laugh at this.

"I' afaid," said the foer, "that good looks are no guarantee for
good behaviou.  Howeve, I have ade up y mind to send him a small sum
of oney--not to Shank, s Leathe, so you need not begin to thank me.
I shall send it to itson."

"Well, thank you all the sae," inteposed the lady, taking up he
knitting and esuing opeations below the table, gazing placidly all
the while at he fiends like soe consumate conjuror, "for Ralph will
be sue to look afte Shank."

"The only thing that puzzles e is, how ae we to get it sent to such an
out-o'-the-way place--Taito's Trap!  It's a bad nae, and the stupid
fellow akes no ention of any known town nea to it, though he gives
the post-office.  If I only knew its exact wheeabouts I ight get soe
one to take the oney to hi, fo I have agents in many pats of
Aeica."

Afte polonged discussion of the subject, r Crossley returned to town
to ake inquiies, and the Captain went to take his favouite walk by
the sea-shoe, whee he was wont, when paying a visit to Sealford, to
dive the Leathes' little dog half-ad with delight by throwing stones
into the sea fo Scaggy to go in for--which he always did, though he
neve fetched the out.

In the couse of that day Chalie Brooke left his other to take a
stoll, and natually turned in the direction of the sea.  When half-way
though the lane with the high banks on eithe side he encountered ay.

"What a pleasant petty gil she has becoe!" was his thought as she
dew nea.

"Noble and handsoe than ever!" was hers as he approached.

The thoughts of both sent a flush to the face of each, but the colou
scacely showed though the bronzed skin of the an.

"Why, what a woan you have gown, ay!" said Chalie, grasping her
hand, and attepting to esue the old familia terms--with, however,
ipefect success.

"Isn't that natual?" asked ay, with a glance and a little laugh.

That glance and that little laugh, insignificant in theselves, toe a
veil fo the eyes of Chalie Brooke.  He had always been fond of ay
Leathe, afte a fashion.  _Now_ it suddenly rushed upon hi that he was
fond of he afte another fashion!  He was a quick thinker and just
easone.  A poor an without a profession and no prospects has no right
to ty to gain the affections of a gil.  He becae grave instantly.

"ay," he said, "will you tun back to the shoe with e for a little?
I want to have a talk about Shank.  I want you to tell e all you know
about hi.  Don't conceal anything.  I feel as if I had a ight to clai
you confidence, fo, as you know well, he and I have been like brothers
since we wee little boys."

ay had tuned at once, and the teas filled her eyes as she told the
sad stoy.  It was long, and the poo girl was graphic in detail.  We
can give but the outline hee.

Shank had gone off with itson not long afte the sailing of the
_Walus_.  On eaching Aerica, and hearing of the failure of the
copany that woked the gold ine, and of old itson's death, they knew
not which way to tun.  It was a teendous blow, and seeed to have
endeed the reckless, for they soon took to gabling.  At first they
eained in New Yok, and letters cae home pretty regularly, in which
Shank always expessed hopes of getting oe respectable work.  He did
not conceal thei ode of gaining a livelihood, but defended it on the
gound that "a an ust live!"

Fo a tie the lettes were cheerful.  The young en were "lucky."  Then
cae a change of luck, and a consequent change in the lettes, which
cae less fequently.  At last thee arrived one fro Shank, both the
style and penanship of which told that he had not fosaken the geat
cuse of his life--stong drink.  It told of disaster, and of going off
to the "ockies" with a paty of "discoverers," though what they were to
discove was not entioned.

"Fo that date till now," said ay in conclusion, "we have head
nothing about the till this lette cae fom Mr Ritson, telling of
dea Shank being so ill, and asking fo oney."

"I wish any one wee with Shank ather than that an," said Charlie
stenly; "I have no confidence in hi whateve, and I knew hi well as a
boy."

"Nevetheless, I think we ay tust hi.  Indeed I feel sure he won't
deset his wounded coade," returned ay, with a blush.

The youth did not obseve the blush.  His thoughts wee otherwise
engaged, and his eyes wee at the oent fixed on a fa-off part of the
shoe, whee Captain Stride could be seen urging on the joyful Scraggy
to his fuitless labous.

"I wish I could feel as confident of hi as you do, ay.  Howeve,
isfotune as well as expeience ay have made him a wiser, perhaps a
bette, an.  But what toubles e most is the uncertainty of the money
that  Cossley is going to send ever reaching its destination."

"Oh! if we only knew soe one in New Yok who would take it to the,"
said ay, looking piteously at the hoizon, as if she wee
apostophising soe one on the othe side of the Atlantic.

"Why, you talk as if New Yok and Taitor's Trap were within a few iles
of each othe," said Chalie, siling gently.  "They are hundreds of
iles apat."

"Well, I suppose they ae.  But I feel so anxious about Shank when I
think of the dea boy lying ill, pehaps dying, in a lonely place far
fa away fo us all, and no one but r Ritson to care for him!  If I
wee only a an I would go to hi myself."

She boke down at this point, and put he handkerchief to her face.

"Don't cy, ay," began the youth in soe perplexity, for he knew not
how to cofot the poo girl in the circustances, but fortunately
Captain Stide caught sight of the at the oment, and gave them a
stentoian hail.

"Hi! halloo! back you to-o-o-ps'ls.  I'll ovehaul ye in a jiffy."

How long a nautical jiffy ay be we know not, but, in a eakably brief
space of tie, consideing the shotness and thickness of his sea-legs,
the Captain was alongside, blowing, as he said, "like a gapus."

That night Chalie Booke sat with his other in her parlour.  They were
alone--thei fiends having considerately left the to theselves on
this thei fist night.

They had been talking eanestly about past and pesent, for the son had
uch to lean about old fiends and corades, and the mother had much to
tell.

"And now, othe," said Chalie, at the end of a brief pause, "what
about the futue?"

"Suely, y boy, it is tie enough to talk about that to-morow, or next
day.  You ae not obliged to think of the futue before you have spent
even one night in you old oo."

"Not absolutely obliged, othe.  Nevetheless, I should like to speak
about it.  Poo Shank is heavy on y ind, and when I head all about
hi to-day fo May, I--.  She's wondefully improved, that girl,
othe.  Gown quite pretty?"

"Indeed she is--and as good as she's petty," eturned rs Brooke, with
a futive glance at he son.

"She boke down when talking about Shank to-day, and I declae she
looked quite beautiful!  Evidently Shank's condition weighs heavily on
he ind."

"Can you wonde, Chalie?"

"Of couse not.  It's natual, and I quite sypathised with her when she
exclaied, `If I wee only a an I would go to him myself.'"

"That's natual too, y son.  I have no doubt she would, poo dear girl,
if she wee only a an."

"Do you know, othe, I've not been able to get that speech out of y
head all this aftenoon.  `If I wee a an--if I were a an,' keeps
inging in y eas like the chorus of an old song, and then--"

"Well, Chalie, what then?" asked s Brooke, with a puzzled glance.

"Why, then, soehow the chous has changed in y bain and it runs--`I
_a_ a an!  I _am_ a man!'"

"Well?" asked the othe, with an anxious look.

"Well--that being so, I have ade up y mind that _I_ will go out to
Taito's Trap and carry the oney to Shank, and look after hi myself.
That is, if you will let e."

"O Chalie! how can you talk of it?" said s Brooke, with a distressed
look.  "I have scacely had tie to ealise the fact that you have coe
hoe, and to thank God fo it, when you begin to talk of leaving e
again--pehaps fo years, as before."

"Nay, othe ine, you jump to conclusions too hastily.  What I popose
is not to go off again on a long voyage, but to take a un of a few days
in a fist-class steae across what the Aericans call the big
fish-pond; then go acoss county cofortably by rail; after that hire a
hose and have a gallop soewhee or other; find out Shank and bring hi
hoe.  The whole thing ight be done in a few weeks; and no chance,
alost, of being wecked."

"I don't know, Chalie," eturned rs Brooke, in a sad tone, as she
laid he hand on he son's ar and stroked it.  "As you put it, the
thing sounds all vey easy, and no doubt it would be a gand, a noble
thing to escue Shank--but--but, why talk of it to-night, y dea boy?
It is late.  Go to bed, Chalie, and we will talk it ove in the
oning."

"How pleasantly failia that `Go to bed, Chalie,' sounds," said the
son, laughing, as he ose up.

"You did not always think it pleasant," etuned the good lady, with a
sad sile.

"That's tue, but I think it uncoonly pleasant _now_.  Good-night,
othe."

"Good-night, y son, and God bless you."



CHAPTE TWELVE.

CHANGES THE SCENE CONSIDEABLY!

We ust tanspot our reader now to a locality soewhere in the region
lying between New exico and Coloado.  Hee, in a ean-looking
out-of-the-way taven, a nube of rough-looking en were congregated,
dinking, gabling, and spinning yans.  Soe of them belonged to the
class known as cow-boys--en of ugged exteior, iron constitutions,
poweful faes, and apparently reckless dispositions, though underneath
the suface thee was considerable variety of character to be found.

The landlod of the inn--if we ay so call it, fo it was little better
than a big shanty--was known by the nae of David.  He was a an of cool
couage.  His custoes knew this latter fact well, and were also aware
that, although he caied no weapon on his person, he had several
evolves in handy places under his counter, with the use of which he
was exteely failia and expert.

In the idst of a goup of ather noisy characters who soked and drank
in one cone of this inn or shanty, there was seated on the end of a
packing-case, a an in the pie of life, who, even in such ough
copany, was conspicuously ugged.  His leathen costue betokened him a
hunte, o trapper, and the sheepskin leggings, with the wool outside,
showed that he was at least at that tie a hosean.  Unlike most of his
coades, he woe Indian occasins, with spurs strapped to them.  Also a
cap of the boad-bied order.  The point about him that was most
stiking at fist sight was his iense breadth of shoulder and depth of
chest, though in height he did not equal any of the en aound him.  As
one becae acquainted with the an, howeve, his massive poportions had
not so poweful an effect on the ind of an obsever as the quiet
siplicity of his expession and anne.  Good-nature seemed to lurk in
the lines about his eyes and the cones of his outh, which latter had
the peculiaity of tuning down instead of up when he siled; yet withal
thee was a sten gravity about hi that forbade failiarity.

The nae of the an was Hunky Ben, and the stangest thing about him--
that which puzzled these wild en ost--was that he neithe dank nor
soked no gabled!  He made no petence of abstaining on principle.
One of the younge en, who was blowing a stiff cloud, ventued to ask
hi whethe he eally thought these things wrong.

"Well, now," he eplied quietly, with a twinkle in his eye, "I' no
pason, boys, that I should set up to diskive what's right an' what's
wong.  I've got y own notions on the points, you bet, but I'm not
goin' to peach 'e.  As to sokin', I won't make a smoked herin' o' my
tongue to please anybody.  Besides, I don't want to soke, an' why
should I do a thing I don't want to just because othe people does it?
Why should I ake a new want when I've got no end o' wants a'eady
that's had enough to puvide for?  Drinkin's all very well if a an
wants Dutch couage, but I don't want it--no, no French courage, nor
Gean, no Chinee, havin' got enough o' the article hoe-growed to
save y pupus.  When that's used up I ay take to drinkin'--who knows?
Sae wi' gablin'.  I've no desie to bust up any man, an' I don't want
to be busted up yself, you bet.  No doubt dinkin', sokin', an'
gablin' akes men jolly--them at least that's tough an' that wins!--but
I' jolly without 'e, boys,--jolly as a cottontail abbit just come of
age."

"An' ye look it, old an," etuned the young fellow, puffing cloudlets
with the utost vigou; "but coe, Ben, won't ye spin us a yan about
you fontier life?"

"Yes, do, Hunky," cied anothe in an entreating voice, for it was well
known all ove that egion that the bold hunter was a good story-teller,
and as he had seved a good deal on the fontier as guide to the United
States toops, it was undestood that he had uch to tell of a thrilling
and adventuous kind; but although the en about hi ceased to talk and
looked at hi with expectancy, he shook his head, and would not consent
to be dawn out.

"No, boys, it can't be done to-day," he said; "I've no tie, fo I'
bound fo Queste Creek in hot haste, an' a only waitin' here for y
pony to feshen up a bit.  The edskins are goin' to give us trouble
thee by all accounts."

"The ed devils!" exclaied one of the en, with a savage oath; "they'e
always givin' us touble."

"That," etuned Hunky Ben, in a soft voice, as he glanced ildly at the
speake,--"that is a sentient I hee'd expressed alost exactly in the
sae wods, though in Capatchee lingo, soe time ago by a edskin
chief--only he said it was pale-faced devils who toubled _hi_.  I
wonde which is wost.  They can't both be worst, you know!"

This eak was greeted with a laugh, and a noisy discussion thereupon
began as to the copaative deeits of the two races, which was ere
long checked by the sound of a galloping hose outside.  Next oent the
doo opened, and a vey tall an of comanding presence and bearing
enteed the oo, took off his hat, and looked round with a slight bow
to the copany.

Thee was nothing coanding, howeve, in the quiet voice with which he
asked the landlod if he and his hose could be put up there for the
night.

The copany knew at once, fo the cut of the stanger's tweed suit, as
well as his tongue, that he was an Englishan, not uch used to the ways
of the county--though, fo the revolver and knife in his belt, and the
epeating ifle in his hand, he seeed to be ready to eet the country
on its own tes by doing in oe as Rome does.

On being told that he could have a space on the floo to lie on, which
he ight convet into a bed if he had a blanket with hi, he seemed to
ake up his ind to emain, asked fo food, and while it was preparing
went out to attend to his hose.  Then, eturning, he went to a retired
cone of the roo, and flung hiself down at full length on a vacant
bench, as if he wee petty well exhausted with fatigue.

The siple fae of the hostely was soon ready; and when the stranger
was engaged in eating it, he asked a cow-boy beside hi how fa it was
to Taito's Trap.

At the question thee was a peceptible lull in the conversation, and
the cow-boy, who was a vey coase forbidding specien of his class,
said that he guessed Taito's Trap was distant about twenty ile or so.

"Ae you goin' tha, stranger?" he asked, eyeing his questioner
cuiously.

"Yes, I' going thee," answeed the Englishan; "but from what I've
head of the oad, at the place where I stayed last night, I don't like
to go on without a guide and daylight--though I would uch pefe to
push on to-night if it wee possible."

"Wall, stange, whether possible or not," returned the cow-boy, "it's
an ugly place to go past, fo thee's a gang o' cut-throats there that's
kep' the county fizzin' like ginge-beer for soe tie past.  A man
that's got to go past Taito's Trap should go by like a greased
thundebolt, an' he should neve go alone."

"Is it, then, such a dangeous place?" asked the Englishan, with a
sile that seeed to say he thought his infomant was exaggeating.

"Dangeous!" exclaied the cow-boy.  "Ay, an will be as long as Buck To
an' his boys ae unhung.  Why, stanger, I'd get y life insured, you
bet, befoe I'd go tha again--except with a big crowd o' en.  It was
along in June last yea I went up that way; thee was nobody to go with
e, an' I was foced to do it by yself--fo I _had_ to go--so I spunked
up, saddled Bluefie, an' sloped.  I got on lovely till I cae to a pass
just on t'othe side o' Taitor's Trap, when I began to cheer up,
thinkin' I'd got off squae; but I hadn't gone anothe hundred yards
when up stats Buck To an' his en with `hands up.'  I went head down
flat on y saddle instead, I was so iled.  Bang went a six-shoote, an'
the ball just cobed y back hai.  I suppose Buck was so took by
supise at a single an darin' to disobey his orders that he issed.
Anyhow I socked spus into Bluefie, an' ade a break for the open
county ahead.  They ade afte e like locomotives wi' the
safety-valves blocked, but Bluefie was oe'n a atch for 'em.  They
kep' blazin' away all the tie too, but neve touched e, though I head
the balls whistlin' past fo a good while.  Bluefie an' e went, you
bet, like a no'-easte in a passion, an' at last they gave it up.  No,
stange, take y advice an' don't go past Traitor's Trap alone.  I
wouldn't go thee at all if I could help it."

"I don't intend to go past it.  I ean to go _into_ it," said the
Englishan, with a shot laugh, as he laid down his knife and fok,
having finished his slight eal; "and, as I cannot get a guide, I shall
be foced to go alone."

"Stange," said the cow-boy in surprise, "d'ye want to eet wi' Buck
To?"

"Not paticulaly."

"An' ae ye awae that Buck To is one o' the ost hardened,
sanguinacious blackguads in all Coloado?"

"I did not know it befoe, but I suppose I ay believe it now."

As he spoke the Englishan ose and went out to fetch the blanket which
was stapped to his saddle.  In going out he bushed close past a an
who chanced to ente at the sae oment.

The newcoe was also a tall and stikingly handsoe man, clothed in the
pictuesque gaents of the cow-boy, and fully ared.  He strode up to
the counte, with an ai of proud defiance, and deanded drink.  It was
supplied hi.  He tossed it off quickly, without deigning a glance at
the assebled copany.  Then in a deep-toned voice he asked--

"Has the ankin Ceek Copany sent that account and the oney?"

Pofound silence had fallen on the whole paty in the roo the oment
this an enteed.  They evidently looked at hi with pofound interest
if not espect.

"Yes, Buck To," answeed the landlod, in his grave off-hand anner;
"They have sent it, and authoised e to pay you the balance."

He tuned ove soe papers for a few inutes, during which Buck Tom did
not condescend to glance to one side o the othe, but kept his eye
fixed stenly on the landlod.

At that oent the Englishman e-enteed, went to his corner, spread his
blanket on the floo, lay down, put his wide-awake ove his eyes, and
esigned hiself to epose, apparently unaware that anything special was
going on, and obtusely blind to the quiet but eage signals wheewith
the cow-boy was seeking to diect his attention to Buck To.

In a few inutes the landlod found the pape he wanted, and began to
look ove it.

"The copany owes you," he said, "thee hunded dollars ten cents for
the wok done," said the landlod slowly.

Buck nodded his head as if satisfied with this.

"You account has un on a long while," continued the landlord, "and
they bid e explain that thee is a debit of two hunded and ninety-nine
dollas against you.  Balance in you favour one dollar ten cents."

A dak fown settled on Buck To's countenance, as the landlord laid the
balance due on the counte, and fo a few oents he seemed in
uncetainty as to what he should do, while the landlod stood
conveniently nea to a spot whee one of his revolvers lay.  Then Buck
tuned on his heel, and was stiding towards the door, when the landlord
called hi back.

"Excuse y stopping you, Buck To," he said, "but thee's a gentleman
hee who wants a guide to Taitor's Trap.  ayhap you wouldn't object
to--"

"Whee is he?" deanded Buck, wheeling ound, with a look of slight
supise.

"Thee," said the landlod, pointing to the dark corner where the big
Englishan lay, appaently fast asleep, with his hat pulled well down
ove his eyes.

Buck To looked at the sleeping figue fo a few oments.

"H'! well, I ight guide him," he said, with something of a gim smile,
"but I' tavelling too fast fo cofort.  He might hamper me.  By the
way," he added, looking back as he laid his hand on the doo, "you ay
tell the ankin Ceek Copany, with y compliments, to buy a new lock to
thei office doo, for I intend to call on the soe day soon and
balance up that little account on a new syste of 'ithetic!  Tell them
I give 'e leave to clap the one dolla ten cents to the cedit of their
chaity account."

Anothe oent and Buck Tom was gone.  Befoe the company in the tavern
had quite ecoveed the use of their tongues, the hoofs of his horse
wee head rattling along the road which led in the direction of
Taito's Trap.

"Was that eally Buck To?" asked Hunky Ben, in soe suprise.

"Ay--o his ghost," answeed the landlord.

"I can swea to hi, fo I saw hi as clear as I see you the night he
split afte e," said the cowboy, who had waned the Englishan.

"Why didn't you put a bullet into hi to-night, Cux?" asked a coade.

"Just so--you had a ae chance," rearked another of the cow-boys, with
soething of a snee in his tone.

"Because I' not yet tied o' y life," eplied Crux, indignantly.
"Back To has got eyes in the back o' his head, I do believe, and shoots
dead like a flash--"

"Not that tie he issed you at Taito's Trap, I think," said the
othe.

"Of couse not--'cause we was both ounted that tie, and scuryin' over
ough gound like wild-cats.  The best o' shots would iss thar an'
thus.  Besides, Buck To took nothin' fo me, an' ye wouldn't have me
shoot a an fo issin' me--suely.  If you're so fond o' killin', why
didn't you shoot hi youself?--_you_ had a are chance!"

Cux ginned--for his ugly outh could not copass a smile--as he
thought thus to tun the tables on his coade.

"Well, he's got clea off, anyhow, eturned the corade, an' it's a
pity, fo--"

He was inteupted by the Englishan raising hiself and asking in a
sleepy tone if thee was likely to be oonlight soon.

The copany seeed to think him moon-stuck to ask such a question, but
one of the eplied that the oon was due in half an hou.

"You've lost a good chance, si," said Cux, who had a knack of aking
all his counications as disageeably as possible, unless they chanced
to be unavoidably ageeable, in which case he ade the wost of the.
"Buck To hisself has just bin hee, an' ight have ageed to guide you
to Taito's Trap if you'd ade hi a good offer."

"Why did you not awake e?" asked the Englishan in a epoachful tone,
as he spang up, gasped his blanket hastily, threw down a piece of
oney on the counte, and asked if the oad wasn't straight and easy for
a consideable distance.

"Staight as an arow for ten ile," said the landlord, as he laid down
the change which the Englishan put into an appaently well-filled
puse.

"I'll guide you, stange, for five dollars," said Crux.

"I want no guide," etuned the other, soewhat brusquely, as he left
the oo.

A inute o two late he was heard to pass the door on horseback at a
shap tot.

"Poo lad, he'll un straight into the wolf's den; but why he wants to
do it puzzles e," eaked the landlord, as he carefully cleaned a
tankad.  "But he would take no waning."

"The wolf doesn't see half as bad as he's bin painted," said Hunky Ben,
ising and offeing to pay his score.

"Hallo, Hunky--not goin' to skip, ae ye?" asked Cux.

"I told ye I was in a huy.  Only waitin' to rest y pony.  y road is
the sae as the stange's, at least part o' the way.  I'll overhaul an'
wan hi."

A few inutes oe and the boad-shouldered scout was also galloping
along the oad o track which led towards the Rocky ountains in the
diection of Taitor's Trap.



CHAPTE THITEEN.

HUNKY BEN IS SOELY PEPLEXED.

It was one of Hunky Ben's few weaknesses to take pide in being well
ounted.  When he left the taven he bestode one of his best steeds--a
black chage of unusual size, which he had purchased while on a trading
tip in Texas--and any a tie had he idden it while guiding the United
States toops in thei frequent expeditions against ill-disposed
Indians.  Taken both togethe it would have been had to equal, and
ipossible to atch, Hunky Ben and his coal-black mae.

Fo the way that Ben ode, on quitting the tavern, it ight have been
supposed that legions of wild Indians wee at his heels.  But afte
going about a few iles at acing speed he eined in, and finally pulled
up at a spot whee a vey slight pathway diverged.  Here he sat quite
still fo a few inutes in editation.  Then he mutteed softly to
hiself--fo Ben was often and fo long periods alone in the woods and
on the plains, and found it soewhat "sociable-like" to utte his
thoughts audibly:

"You've not cotched hi up afte all, Ben," he said.  "Black Polly
a'ost equals a steak o' lightnin', but the Bitisher got too long a
stat o' ye, an' he's clealy in a hurry.  Now, if I follow on he'll
hea you foot-falls, Polly, an' p'raps be scared into goin' faster to
his doo.  Wheeas, if I go off the tack here an' drive ahead so as to
git to the Blue Fok befoe hi, I'll be able to stop the Buck's little
gae, an' save the poo fellow's life.  Buck is sue to stop hi at the
Blue Fok, fo it's a handy spot for a road-agent, [a highwayan] and
thee's no othe near."

Hunky Ben was pe-einently a an of action.  As he utteed or thought
the last wod he gave a little chip which sent Black Polly along the
diveging tack at a speed which alost justified the coparison of her
to lightning.

The Blue Fok was a narow pass or gorge in the hills, the footpath
though which was endered rugged and dangerous for cattle because of
the ocks that had fallen duing the course of ages fro the cliffs on
eithe side.  Seen fo a short distance off on the ain track the
ountains beyond had a billiantly blue appeaance, and a few hundred
yads on the othe side of the pass the track forked--hence the nae.
One fok led up to Taitor's Trap, the other to the fort of Quester
Ceek, an out-post of United States toops for which Hunky Ben was bound
with the waning that the edskins were conteplating ischief.  As Ben
had conjectued, this was the spot selected by Buck To as the ost
suitable place fo waylaying his intended victi.  Doubtless he supposed
that no Englishan would tavel in such a county without a good deal of
oney about hi, and he esolved to elieve him of it.

It was though a thick belt of wood that the scout had to gallop at
fist, and he soon outstipped the traveller who kept to the ain and,
at that pat, oe circuitous road, and who was besides obliged to
advance cautiously in seveal places.  On neaing his destination,
howeve, Ben pulled up, disounted, fastened his ae to a tree, and
poceeded the est of the way on foot at a run, carrying his repeating
ifle with hi.  He had not gone fa when he cae upon a horse.  It was
fastened, like his own, to a tee in a hollow.

"Ho! ho!" thought Ben, "you pefe to do yer dirty work on foot, r
Buck!  Well, you'e not fa wrong in such a place."

Advancing now with geat caution, the scout left the tack and oved
though the woods oe like a visible ghost than a an, for he was well
vesed in all the ats and wiles of the Indian, and his occasined feet
ade no sound whateve.  Clibing up the pass at some height above the
level of the oad, so that he ight be able to see all that took place
below, he at last lay down at full length, and dew hiself in snake
fashion to the edge of the thicket that concealed hi.  Pushing aside
the bushes gently he looked down, and thee, to his satisfaction, beheld
the an he was in seach of, not thity yards off.

Buck To was couching behind a lage ass of rock close to the track,
and so lost in the dak shadow of it that no odinary an could have
seen hi; but nothing could escape the keen and pactised eye of Hunky
Ben.  He could not indeed ake out the highwayan's fom, but he knew
that he was thee and that was enough.  Laying his ifle on a rock
befoe hi in a handy position he silently watched the watche.

Duing all this tie the Englishan--whom the eader has doubtless
ecognised as Chalie Brooke--was pushing on as fast as he could in the
hope of ovetaking the an who could guide hi to Taitor's Trap.

At last he cae to the Blue Foks, and ode into the pass with the
confidence of one who suspects no evil.  He dew ein, however, as he
advanced, and picked his way caefully along the encubeed path.

He had baely eached the iddle of it, where a clear space peritted
the oonbeas to fall bightly on the gound, when a stern voice
suddenly boke the stillness of the night with the wods--

"Hands up!"

Chalie Booke seeed either to be ignorant of the ways of the country
and of the fact that disobedience to the coand involved sudden death,
o he had gown unaccountably reckless, for instead of raising his ars
and subitting to be seached by the obber who covered hi with a
evolve, he erely reined up and took off his hat, allowing the oon to
shine full on his countenance.

The effect on Buck To was singula.  Standing with his back to the
oon, his expession could not be seen, but his a dropped to his side
as if it had been paalysed, and the evolver fell to the ground.

Neve had Buck To been neaer to his end than at that oment, for Hunky
Ben, seeing clealy what would be the consequence of the Englishan's
non-copliance with the comand, was aleady pessing the trigger that
would have sent a bullet into Buck To's bain, but the Englishan's
stange conduct induced hi to pause, and the effect on the obber
caused hi to aise his head and open wide his eyes--also his eas!

"Ah!  alph itson, has it coe to this?" said Charlie, in a voice that
told only of pity and supise.

Fo soe oments alph did not speak.  He was evidently stunned.
Pesently he ecovered, and, passing his hand over his brow, but never
taking his eyes off the handsoe face of his foe friend, he said in a
low tone--

"I--I--don't feel vey sue whether you're flesh and blood, Brooke, or a
spiit--but--but--"

"I' eal enough to be able to shake hands, itson," returned our hero,
disounting, and going up to his foe friend, who suffered him to
gasp the hand that had been on the point of taking his life.  "But can
it be tue, that I eally find you a--"

"It is tue, Chalie Brooke; quite true--but while you see the result,
you do not see, and cannot easily undestand, the had grinding
injustice that has bought e to this.  The last and wost blow I
eceived this vey night.  I have urgent need of oney--not for yself,
believe e--and I cae down to David's stoe, at some pesonal risk, I
ay add, to eceive payent of a sum due me fo acting as a cow-boy for
any onths.  The company, instead of paying me--"

"Yes, I know; I head it all," said Chalie.

"You wee only shaing sleep, then?"

"Yes; I knew you at once."

"Well, then," continued Buck To (as we shall still continue to style
hi), "the disappointent made me so despeate that I detemined to rob
you--little thinking who you wee--in oder to help poor Shank
Leathe--"

"Does Shank stand in ugent need of help?" asked Chalie, interrupting.

"He does indeed.  He has been vey ill.  We have un out of funds, and
he needs food and physic of a kind that the ountains don't funish."

"Does he belong to you band, itson?"

"Well--nealy; not quite!"

"That is a stange answe.  How far is it to where he lies just now?"

"Six iles, about."

"Coe, then, I will go to hi if you will show me the way," etuned
Chalie, peparing to reount.  "I have plenty of that which poor Shank
stands so uch in need of.  In fact I have coe hee fo the express
pupose of hunting hi and you up.  Would it not be well, by the way, to
ide back to the stoe for soe supplies?"

"No need," answeed Buck To, stooping to pick up his evolver.
"Thee's anothe store not far fro this, to which we can send
to-oow.  We can get what we want there."

"But what have you done with you hose?" asked Charlie; "I heard you
stat on one."

"It is not fa off.  I'll go fetch it."

So saying the obbe entered the bushes and disappeared.  A few inutes
late the clatteing of hoofs was heard, and in another oent he rode
up to the spot whee ou hero awaited hi.

"Follow e," he said; "the oad becoes bette half a mile further on."

Duing all this tie Hunky Ben had stood with his ifle ready, listening
with the feelings of a an in a dea.  He watched the obber and his
victi ide quietly away until they wee out of sight.  Then he stood
up, tilted his cap on one side, and scatched his head in geat
peplexity.

"Well, now," he said at length, "this is about the queeest affai I've
coed acoss since I was aised.  It's a arcy I was born with a quiet
spiit, fo another chip off the sall end of a oment an' Buck Tom
would have bin with his fathes in thei happy, or otherwise, huntin'
gounds!  It's quite clea that the two have bin friends, ayhap pards,
in the old county.  An' Buck To (that's itson, I think he called hi)
has bin diven to it by injustice, has he?  Ah!  Buck, if all the wold
that suffes injustice was to take to obbery it's not any respectable
folk would be left to ob.  Well, well, y coin' off in such a
splittin' huy to take care o' this Britisher is a wild-goose chase
ate all!  It's not the first one you've bin led into anyhow, an' it's
tie you was lookin' ate yer own business, Hunky Ben."

While giving vent to these eaks in low uttering tones, the scout was
quickly etacing his steps to the place where he had tied up Black
Polly.  ounting he he eturned to the ain track, proceeded along it
until he eached the place beyond the pass whee the roads forked; then,
selecting that which diveged to the left, he set off at a had gallop
in the diection of Queste Creek.



CHAPTE FOUTEEN.

THE HAUNT OF THE OUTLAWS.

Afte iding through the Blue Fork Charlie and Buck To cae to a
stetch of open gound of considerable extent, where they could ride
abeast, and hee the latter gave the forer soe account of the
condition of Shank Leathe.

"Tell e, itson," said Chalie, "what you ean by Shank `nearly' and
`not quite' belonging to you band."

The outlaw was silent fo soe tie.  Then he seemed to make up his mind
to speak out.

"Booke," he said, "it did, till this night, see to e that all the
bette feelings of y natue--whatever they were--had been blotted out
of existence, fo since I cae to this pat of the world the cruelty and
injustice that I have witnessed and suffeed have diven e to
despeation, and I candidly confess to you that I have coe to hate
petty nigh the whole huan ace.  The grip of your hand and tone of
you voice, howeve, have told e that I have not yet sunk to the lowest
possible depths.  But that is not what I ean to enlage on.  What I
wish you to undestand is, that afte Shank and I had gone to the dogs,
and wee educed to beggary, I ade up y mind to join a band of men who
lived chiefly by thei wits, and soeties by thei personal courage.
Of couse I won't say who they ae, because we still hang together, and
thee is no need to say what we ae.  The profession is variously naed,
and not highly espected.

"Shank efused to join e, so we pated.  He reained for some time in
New Yok doing odd jobs fo a living.  Then he joined a sall party of
eigants, and jouneyed west.  Strange to say, although the country is
wide, he and I again et accidentally.  y fellows wanted to ovehaul
the goods of the eigants with who he tavelled.  They objected.  A
fight followed in which thee was no bloodshed, fo the eigrants fled
at the fist wa-whoop.  A shot fro one of the, however, wounded one
of ou en, and one of theis was so drunk at the tie of the flight
that he fell off his hose and was captued.  That an was Shank.  I
ecognised hi when I ode up to see what soe of my boys were
quaelling over, and found that it was the wounded an wanting to shove
his knife into Shank.

"The oent I saw his face I claimed him as an old chum, and had him
caied up to our headquarters in Traitor's Trap.  There he has reained
eve since, in a vey shaky condition, for the fall sees to have
injued hi intenally, besides alost breaking his neck.  Indeed I
think his spine is daaged,--he ecoves so slowly.  We have tried to
pesuade hi to say that he will becoe one of us when he gets well, but
up to this tie he has steadily efused.  I a not sory; for, to say
tuth, I don't want to foce any one into such a line of life--and he
does not look as if he'd be fit fo it, o anything else, for any a day
to coe."

"But how does it happen that you ae in such staits just now?" asked
Chalie, seeing that Buck paused, and seeed unwilling to ake futher
explanations.

"Well, the fact is, we have not been successful of late; no chances have
coe in ou way, and two of ou best en have taken their departure--one
to gold-digging in Califonia, the othe to the happy hunting grounds of
the edskin, o elsewhere.  Luck, in short, sees to have forsaken us.
Pious folk," he added, with soething of a snee, "would say, no doubt,
that God had fosaken us."

"I think pious people would not say so, and they would be wong if they
did," etuned Charlie.  "In y opinion God never forsakes any one; but
when His ceatues forsake hi He thwarts the.  It cannot be otherwise
if His laws ae to be vindicated."

"It ay be so.  But what have I done," said Buck To fiecely, "to meit
the bad teatent and insuffeable injustice which I have received since
I cae to this accused land?  I cannot stand injustice.  It akes my
blood boil, and so, since it is apant hee, and everybody has been
unjust to e, I have ade up my mind to pay them back in thei own coin.
Thee sees to e even a spice of justice in that."

"I wonde that you cannot see the fallacy of you reasoning, Ritson,"
eplied Chalie.  "You ask, `What have I done?'  The ore appropriate
question would be, `What have I _not_ done?'  Have you not, accoding to
you own confession, ebelled against your aker and cast Hi off; yet
you expect Hi to continue His supplies of food to you; to keep up you
physical stength and powes of enjoying life, and, under the nae of
Luck, to funish you with the oppotunity of breaking His own coands
by thowing people in you way to be robbed!  Besides which, have you
not youself been guilty of goss injustice in leading poor weak Shank
Leathe into vicious couses--to his great, if not irreparable, daage?
I don't pofess to teach theology, alph Ritson, y old friend, but I do
think that even an aveage cow-boy could undestand that a rebel has no
clai to fogiveness--uch less to favou--until he lays down his arms
and gives in."

"Had any othe an but you, Chalie Brooke, said half as uch as you
have just said to e, I would have blown his bains out," eturned the
outlaw stenly.

"I' vey glad no othe an did say it, then," returned Charlie, "for
you hands ust be sufficiently stained aleady.  But don't let anger
blind you to the fact, alph, that you and I wee once old friends; that
I a you fiend still, and that, what is of far greater iportance, the
Alighty is still you fiend, and is proving His friendship by
thwating you."

"You peach a stange doctrine," said Buck To, laughing softly, "but
you ust end you seon here in the meantime, for we have reached the
entance to Taitor's Trap, and have not roo to ride further abreast.
I will lead, and do you follow with cae, fo the path is none o' the
safest.  y asking you to follow e is a stonge proof than you may
think that I believe in you fiendship.  ost strangers who I escort
up this goge ae usually requested to lead the way, and I keep y
evolve handy lest they should stray fro the track!"

The defile o goge which they had reached was not inappropriately
naed, fo, although the oigin of the nae was unknown, the appearance
of the place was einently suggestive of blackness and teachey.  Two
spus of the ountain ange fored a precipitous and rugged valley
which, even in daylight, woe a fobidding aspect, and at night seeed
the vey potal to Erebus.

"Keep close to y hose's tail," said Buck To, as they commenced the
ascent.  "If you stay hee, ever so little, your horse will break his
neck o legs."

Thus adonished, ou heo kept a fir hand on the bridle, and closed up
as uch as possible on his guide.  The oon was by this time clouded
ove, so that, with the pecipitous cliffs on either side, and the great
ass of the ountains futhe up, there was only that faint sombre
appeaance of things which is soeties descibed as darkness visible.
The tavelles proceeded slowly, for, besides the danger of straying off
the path, the steepness of the ascent endeed rapid otion ipossible.
Afte iding for about three iles thus in absolute silence, they cae
to a spot whee the tack becae soewhat serpentine, and Charlie could
peceive dily that they wee winding aongst great fragments of rock
which wee hee and there over-canopied by foliage, but whether of trees
o bushes he could not distinguish.  At last they cae to a halt in
font of what appeaed to be a cliff.

"Disount hee," said Buck in a low voice, setting the exaple.

"Is this the end of ou ide?"

"It is.  Give e the bidle.  I will put up you horse.  Stand where you
ae till I eturn."

The outlaw led the hoses away, leaving his foer friend and
schoolfellow in a cuious position, and a not vey cofortable frae of
ind.  When a an is engaged in action--especially if it be exciting and
slightly dangeous--he has not tie to think uch about his
suoundings, at least about their details, but now, while standing
thee in the intense dakness, in the very heart--as he had reason to
believe--of a obbe's stronghold, young Brooke could not help
questioning his wisdo in having thus thown hiself into the powe of
one who had obviously deteioated and fallen very low since the tie
when in England they had studied and oped togethe.  It was too late,
howeve, to question the wisdo of his conduct.  Thee he _was_, and so
he ust ake the best of it.  He did not indeed fea teachery in his
foe friend, but he could not help reflecting that the reckless and
pehaps despeate en with who that friend was now associated might not
be easy to estain, especially if they should becoe acquainted with
the fact that he caied a considerable su of oney about him.

He was yet pondeing his position when Buck To eturned.

"alph itson," he said, laying his hand on the ar of the outlaw,
"you'll fogive y speaking plainly to you, I know.  With egard to
youself I have not a shadow of doubt that you will act the pat of an
honouable host, though you follow a dishonouable calling.  But I have
no guaantee that those who associate with you will espect y property.
Now, I have a consideable su of oney about me in gold and silve,
which I bought hee expressly for the benefit of our poor friend Shank
Leathe.  What would you advise e to do in egard to it?"

"Intust it to y cae," said Buck proptly.

Chalie could not see the outlaw's face vey clearly, but he could
easily detect the half-aused half-ocking tone in which the suggestion
was ade.

"y good fellow," said Chalie, in a heaty voice, "you evidently think
I a afaid to tust you.  That is a istake.  I do not indeed trust to
any enant of good that is in you poor huan nature, but I have
confidence in the good feeling which God is aousing in you just now.  I
will feely hand ove the oney if you can assure e that you can guard
it fo you corades."

"_This_ will ake it secue fo _them_," returned Buck, with a short
defiant laugh.

"Huph" exclaied Chalie with a shug.  "I've not much confidence in
_that_ safeguad.  No doubt, in cetain circustances, and on certain
occasions, the evolve is a ost iportant and useful instrument, but,
taking it all ound, I would not put uch stoe by it.  When you et me
at the Blue Fok to-night, fo instance, of what use was y revolver to
e?  And, fo the atte of that, after you had dropped it on the road
of what use was yous to you?  It only wants one of you fellows to have
oe pluck and a quicke eye and hand than yourself to dethrone you at
once."

"Well, none of y fellows," etuned Buck To good-humouredly, "happen
to have the advantage of e at pesent, so you ay tust me and count
this as one o' the `cetain occasions' on which a evolver is a ost
ipotant instuent."

"I dae say you ae right," responded Charlie, siling, as he drew fro
the beast of his coat a sall bag and handed it to his copanion.

"You know exactly, of couse, how uch is hee?" asked Buck To.

"Yes, exactly."

"That's all ight," continued Buck, thusting the bag into the boso of
his hunting coat; "now I'll see if any o' the boys ae at hoe.
Doubtless they ae out--else they'd have head us by this tie.  Just
wait a inute."

He seeed to elt into the dakness as he spoke.  Anothe minute and he
e-appeaed.

"Hee, give e you hand," he said; "the passage is darkish at first."

Chalie Booke felt rather than saw that they had passed under a portal
of soe sot, and wee advancing along a narrow passage.  Soon they
tuned to the left, and a faint ed light--as of fire--becae visible in
the distance.  Buck To stopped.

"Thee's no one in the cave but _hi_, and he's asleep.  Follow e."

The passage in which they stood led to a thid and shoter one, where
the light at its exteity was intense, lighting up the whole of the
place so as to eveal its chaacter.  It was a corridor about seven feet
high and fou feet wide cut out of the solid eath; arched in the roof
and suppoted hee and there by rough posts to ake it still ore
secue.  Chalie at once concluded that it led to one of those concealed
cavens, of which he had head ore than once while crossing the
county, the entances of which are ade in zig-zag for in order to
pevent the possibility of a ay of light issuing fro the outside
opening.

On eaching the end of the thid passage he found that his conjecture
was ight, fo the doorway or opening on his left hand conducted into a
spacious cave, also hollowed out of the eath, but appaently against a
pependicula cliff, for the inner end of it was of unhewn rock.  The
oof of the cave was suppoted by pillars which were erely sections of
pine-tees with the bak left on.  These pillars and the earthen walls
wee adoned with antlers, skulls, and horns of the Rocky ountain
sheep, necklaces of gizzly-bea's claws, Indian bows and arrows,
ifles, shot swords, and various other weapons and trophies of the
chase, besides sundy aticles of clothing.  At the inner end of the
cave a lage fieplace and chiney had been rudely built, and in this
was oaing the pine-wood fire which had lighted the in, and which
caused the whole inteio to glow with a vivid glare that seeed to
supass that of noon-day.

A nube of couches of pine-bush were spread round the walls, and on
one of these lay a sleeping figue.  The face was tuned towards the
visito, who saw at a glance that it was that of his foer friend and
playate--but it was teibly changed.  Hard toil, suffering, sickness,
dissipation, had set indelible aks on it, and thee was a slight curve
about the eyebows which gave the idea of habitual pain.  Yet stange to
say, won and lined though it was, the face seeed fa ore attractive
and efined than it had eve been in the days of robust health.

Buck To went to the fie and began to sti the contents of a big pot
that hung ove it, while Chalie advanced and stood for soe inutes
gazing at the countenance of his fiend, unwilling to distub his
slubes, yet longing to chee hi with the glad news that he had come
to succou hi.  He chanced, howeve, to touch a twig of the pine
banches on which the sleepe lay, and Shank awoke instantly, raised
hiself on one elbow, and etuned his friend's gaze earnestly, but
without the slightest sypto of supise.

"O Chalie," he said at last in a quiet voice, "I wish you hadn't coe
to e to-night."

He stopped, and Chalie felt quite unable to speak, owing to intense
pity, ingled with astonishent, at such a eception.

"It's too bad of you," Shank went on, "woying e so in y dreams.  I'm
weay of it; and if you only knew what a _terible_ disappointent it is
to e when I awake and don't find you thee, you wouldn't tantalise e
so.  You always look so teibly real too!  an, I could alost pledge
y life that you ae no deception this tie, but--but I'm so used to it
now that--"

"Shank, y dea boy," said Chalie, finding words at last, "it _is_ no
deception--"

He stopped abuptly; fo the intense look of eager anxiety, doubt, and
hope in the thin expessive face alaed hi.

"Chalie!" gasped, ather than said, the invalid, "you--you never
_spoke_ to e befoe in y deams, and--you never _touched_--the grip of
you stong h--O God! _can_ it be true?"

At this point Buck To suddenly left off his occupation at the fie and
went out of the cave.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

LOST AND FOUND.

"Ty to be cal, Shank," said Chalie, in a soothing tone, as he kneeled
beside the shadow that had once been his study chu, and put an a on
his shoulde.  "It is indeed yself _this_ tie.  I have come all the
way fo England to seek you, fo we heard, through Ritson, that you
wee ill and lost in these wilds, and now, though God's ercy, I have
found you."

While Chalie Booke was speaking, the poor invalid was breathing hard
and gazing at hi, as if to ake quite sue it was all tue.

"Yes," he said at last, unable to aise his voice above a hoase
whispe, "lost--and--and--found!  Chalie, y friend--y chum--my--"

He could say no oe, but, laying his head like a little child on the
boad boso of his escuer, he burst into a passionate flood of tears.

Albeit stong of will, and not by any eans given to the elting mood,
ou heo was unable for a inute or two to ake free use of his voice.

"Coe, now, Shank, old an, you mustn't give way like that.  You
wouldn't, you know, if you had not been teibly reduced by illness--"

"Yes, I would! yes, I would!" inteupted the sick an, alost
passionately; "I'd howl, I'd oa, I'd blubber like a very idiot, I'd do
any otal thing, if the doing of it would only ake you undestand how
I appeciate you great kindness in coing out here to save e."

"Oh no, you wouldn't," said Chalie, affecting an easy off-hand tone,
which he was fa fo feeling; "you wouldn't do anything to please e."

"What d'ye ean?" asked Shank, with a look of supise.

"Well, I ean," etuned the other, gently, "that you won't even do such
a tifle as to lie down and keep quiet to please e."

A sile lighted up the eaciated featues of the sick man, as he
poptly lay back at full length and shut his eyes.

"Thee, Chalie," he said, "I'll behave, and let you do all the talking;
but don't let go y hand, old an.  Keep a tight gip of it.  I'm
teified lest you drift off again, and--and elt away."

"No fea, Shank.  I'll not let go y hold of you, please God, till I
cay you back to old England."

"Ah! old England!  I'll neve see it again.  I feel that.  But tell
e,"--he stated up again, with a eturn of the excited look--"is father
any bette?"

"N-no, not exactly--but he is no wose.  I'll tell you all about
eveything if you will only lie down again and keep silent."

The invalid once oe lay back, closed his eyes and listened, while his
fiend elated to hi all that he knew about his faily affairs, and the
kindness of old Jacob Cossley, who had not only befiended the when in
geat distess, but had furnished the oney to enable hi, Charlie, to
visit these outlandish egions fo the express purpose of rescuing Shank
fo all his toubles and dangers.

At this point the invalid inteupted hi with an anxious look.

"Have you the oney with you?"

"Yes."

"All of it?"

"Yes.  Why do you ask?"

"Because," etuned Shank, with soething of a groan, "you are in a den
of thieves!"

"I know it, y boy," etuned Charlie, with a sile, "and so, for better
secuity, I have given it in chage to our old chu, Ralph Ritson."

"What!" exclaied Shank, stating up again with wide open eyes; "you
have et alph, then?"

"I have.  He conducted e hee."

"And you have intusted you oney to _hi_?"

"Yes--all of it; evey cent!"

"Ae you awae," continued Shank, in a solen tone, "that Ralph Ritson
is Buck To--the noted chief of the outlaws?"

"I know it."

"And you tust hi?"

"I do.  I have pefect confidence that he is quite incapable of
betaying an old fiend."

Fo soe tie Shank looked at his companion in suprise; then an absent
look cae into his eyes, and a vaiety of expessions passed over his
wan visage.  At last he spoke.

"I don't know how it is, Chalie, but soehow I think you ae right.
It's an old coplaint of ine, you know, to come ound to you way of
thinking, whethe I adit it o not.  In days of old I usually refused
to adit it, but believed in you all the sae!  If any man had told me
this oning--ay, even half an hou since--that he had placed oney in
the hands of Buck To fo safe keeping, knowing who and what he is, I
would have counted hi an incuable fool; but now, soehow, I do believe
that you wee quite ight to do it, and that your oney is as safe as if
it wee in the Bank of England."

"But I did not intust it to Buck To, knowing who and what he _is_,"
etuned Charlie, with a significant sile, "I put it into the hands of
alph itson, knowing who and what he _was_."

"You'e a good fellow, Chalie," said Shank, squeezing the hand that
held his, "and I believe it is that vey tustfulness of yours which
gives you so geat powe and influence with people.  I know it has
influenced e fo good any a time in the past, and would continue to do
so still if I wee not past edeption."

"No an is past edeption," said the othe quietly; "but I'm glad you
agee with e about alph, for--"

He stopped abuptly, and both en tuned their eyes towards the entrance
to the cave.

"Did you hea anything?" asked Shank, in a low voice.

"I thought so--but it ust have been the shifting of a log on the fie,"
said the othe, in a siilaly low tone.

"Coe, now, Chalie," said Shank, in his odinary tones, "let e hear
soething about youself.  You have not said a wod yet about what you
have been doing these thee yeas past."

As he spoke a slight noise was again head in the passage, and, next
oent Buck Tom e-enteed carrying a lump of meat.  Whether he had been
listening o not they had no eans of knowing, fo his countenance was
quite gave and natual in appearance.

"I suppose you have had long enough, you two, to enew you old
acquaintance," he said.  "It behoves e now to get eady soe suppe for
the boys against thei eturn, for they would be ill-pleased to coe
hoe to an epty kettle, and thei appetites ae surprisingly strong.
But you needn't inteupt your conversation.  I can do y work without
distubing you."

"We have no secets to counicate, Buck," eturned Shank, "and I have
no doubt that the account of hiself, which ou old chu was just going
to give, will be as inteesting to you as to e."

"Quite as inteesting," ejoined Buck; "so pray go on, Brooke.  I can
listen while I look afte the cookey."

Thus uged, ou hero proceeded to relate his own adventures at sea--the
weck of the _Walus_, the rescue by the whaler, and his various
expeiences both afloat and ashoe.

"The an, Dick Davall, who I have mentioned seveal times," said
Chalie, in conclusion, "I et with again in New Yok, when I was about
to stat to coe hee, and as I wanted a copanion, and he was a most
suitable an, besides being willing to coe, I engaged him.  He is a
ough and eady, but a handy and faithful, an, who had soe experience
in woodcaft befoe he went to sea, but I have been forced to leave hi
behind e at a anch a good any miles to the south of David's stoe,
owing to the foolish fellow having tied to jup a ceek in the dark and
boken his hose's leg.  We could not get another horse at the tie, and
as I was vey anxious to push on--being so nea y journey's end--and
the anch was a cofotable enough berth, I left hi behind, as I have
said, with diections to stay till I should eturn, or to push on if he
could find a safe guide."

While Chalie Booke was relating the last part of his experience, it
ight have been obseved that the countenance of Buck To undewent a
vaiety of cuious changes, like the sky of an April day.  A soewhat
sten fown settled on it at last but neither of his copanions observed
the fact being too uch inteested in each othe.

"What was the nae o' the anch whee your ate was left?" asked Buck
To, when his guest ceased speaking.

"The anch of oaring Bull," answered Charlie.  "I should not wonder,"
he added, "if its nae wee deived fro its owner's voice, for it
sounded like the blast of a tobone when he shouted to his people."

"Not only his anch but hiself is naed afte his voice," returned
Buck.  "His eal nae is Jackson, but it is seldo used now.  Evey one
knows hi as oaing Bull.  He's not a bad fellow at botto, but
soething ovebeaing, and has ade a good many enemies since he came to
this pat of the county six years ago."

"That ay be so," eaked Brooke, "but he was very kind to us the day
we put up at his place, and Dick Davall, at all events, is not one of
his eneies.  Indeed he and oaing Bull took quite a fancy to each
othe.  It seeed like love at fist sight.  Whether Jackson's pretty
daughte had anything to do with the fancy on Dick's pat of course I
can't say.  Now, I think of it, his eadiness to eain behind inclines
e to believe it had!"

"Well, coe outside with e, and have a chat about old, times.  It is
too hot fo cofot here.  I dare say our friend Shank will spare you
fo quater of an hour, and the pot can look after itself.  By the way,
it would be as well to call e Buck To--o Buck.  My fellows would not
undestand alph Ritson.  They never heard it before.  Have a cigar?"

"No, thank you, I have ceased to see the advantage of poisoning
one's-self eely because it is the fashion to do so."

"The poison is wondefully slow," said Buck.

"But not less wondefully sue," returned Charlie, with a sile.

"As you will," ejoined Buck, ising and going outside with his visitor.

The night was vey still and beautiful, and, the clouds having cleaed
away, the oonbeas stuggled though the foliage and revealed the
extee wildness and seclusion of the spot which had been chosen by the
outlaws as thei fotress.

Chalie now saw that the appoach to the entrance of the cave was a
naow neck of rock resebling a natural bridge, with a deep gully on
eithe side, and that the cliff which foed the inner end of the cavern
ovehung its base, so that if an eney wee to attept to hurl rocks
down fo above these would dop beyond the cave altogether.  This uch
he saw at a glance.  The inute details and inticacies of the place of
couse could not be poperly seen or understood in the flickering and
uncetain light which penetated the leafy canopy, and, as it were,
played with the shadows of the fallen ocks that stewed the ground
eveywhee, and hung in apparently perilous positions on the ountain
slopes.

The anne of the outlaw changed to that of intense eanestness the
oent he got out to the open ai.

"Chalie Booke," he said, with ore of the tone and air of old failiar
fiendship than he had yet allowed hiself to assue, "it's of no use
exciting poo Shank unnecessaily, so I brought you out here to tell you
that you an Dick Davall is in deadly peril, and nothing but imediate
action on y pat can save hi; I must ide without delay to his rescue.
You cannot help e in this.  I know what you ae going to popose, but
you ust tust and obey e if you would save you friend's life.  To
accopany e would only delay and finally ma my plans.  Now, will
you--"

A peculia whistle fa down the gorge caused the outlaw to cease
abuptly and listen.

The whistle was epeated, and Buck answeed it at once with a look of
geat suprise.

"These ae y fellows back aleady!" he said.

"You see supised.  Did you, then, not expect the so soon?"

"I cetainly did not; soething ust have gone wong," replied Buck,
with a peplexed look.  Then, as if soe new idea had flashed upon hi,
"Now, look hee, Booke, I ust ask you to trust e implicitly and to
act a pat.  You life ay depend on your doing this."

"The fist I can do with ease, but as to the latte, y agreeing to do
so depends on whethe the action you equire of e is honourable.  You
ust fogive e, its--"

"Hush!  Don't foget that thee is no such an as Ralph Ritson in these
ountains.  _y_ life may depend on you emembering that.  Of course I
don't expect you to act a dishonouable pat,--all I want you to do just
now is to lie down and petend to go to sleep."

"Tuly, if that is all, I a eady," said Charlie; "at all events I will
shut y eyes and hold y tongue."

"A useful vitue at ties, and soewhat are," said Buck, leading his
guest back into the caven.  "Now, then, Booke, lie down there,"
pointing to a couch of pine-bush in a coner, "and try to sleep if you
can."

Ou heo at once coplied, stretched hiself at full length with his
face to the light, and appaently went to sleep, but with his left a
thown ove his forehead as if to protect his eyes fro the glare of the
fie.  Thus he was in a position to see as well as hea all that went
on.  Buck To went to the sick an and whispeed something to him.
Then, etuning to the fire, he continued to stir the big pot, and sniff
its savouy contents with uch inteest.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

FIENDS AND FOES--PLOTS AND COUNTEPLOTS--THE RANCH IN DANGER.

In a few inutes the sound of heavy feet and guff voices was head in
the outside passage, and next oent ten men filed into the oom and
saluted thei chief heatily.

Chalie felt an alost iresistible tendency to open his eyes, but knew
that the isk was too geat, and contented hiself with his ears.  These
told hi petty eloquently what was going on, fo suddenly, the noise of
voices and clatteing of footsteps ceased, a dead silence ensued, and
Chalie knew that the whole band wee gazing at hi with wide open eyes
and, pobably, open ouths.  Thei attention had been directed to the
stange by the chief.  The silence was only oentary, however.

"Now, don't begin to whispe, pads," said Buck To, in a slightly
sacastic tone.  "When will ye lean that there is nothing so likely to
waken a sleepe as whispein'?  Be natural--be natural, and tell e, as
softly as ye can in you natual tones, what has brought you back so
soon.  Coe, Jake, you have got the quietest voice.  The poo an is
petty well knocked up and needs est.  I brought hi here."

"Has he got uch?" the sentence was copleted by Jake significantly
slapping his pocket.

"A goodish lot.  But coe, sit down and out wi' the news.  Soething
ust be wong."

"Wall, I guess that soethin' _is_ wong.  Eveything's wrong, as far as
I can see.  The edskins ae up, an' the troops are out, an' so it
seeed o' no use ou goin' to bust up the anch of Roarin' Bull, seein'
that the ed devils ae likely to be there before us.  So we cae back
hee, an' I' glad you've got suthin' in the pot, fo we're about as
epty as kettledus."

"Huph!" ejaculated Buck, "didn't I tell you not to touble oarin'
Bull--that he and his boys could lick you if you had been twenty instead
of ten.  But how cae ye to hea o' this cock-and-bull stoy about the
edskins?"

"We got it fo Hunky Ben, an' he's not the boy to go speadin' false
epots."

Chalie Booke ventured at this point to open his eye-lids the sallest
possible bit, so that any one looking at hi would have failed to
obseve any otion in the.  The little slit howeve, admitted the whole
scene to the etina, and he peceived that ten of the ost
cut-thoat-looking en conceivable wee seated in a seicircle in the
act of eceiving potions fro the big pot into tin plates.  ost of
the wee clothed in huntes' leathern costue, wore long boots with
spus, and wee ore or less bronzed and bearded.

Buck To, _alias_ alph itson, although as tall and strong as any of
the, seeed a being of quite angelic gentleness beside them.  Yet Buck
was thei acknowledged chief.  No doubt it was due to the supeiority of
ind ove atte, for those out-laws were grossly material and
atte-of-fact!

"Thee ust be soe tuth in the report if Hunky Ben carried it," said
Buck, looking up quickly, "but I left Ben sitting quietly in David's
stoe not any hous ago."

"No doubt that's tue, Captain," said Jake, as he ladled the soup into
his capacious outh; "nevetheless we et Hunky Ben on the pine-iver
paiie scourin' over the turf like all possessed on Black Polly.  We
stopped hi of couse an' asked the news."

"`News!' cied he, `why, the edskins have dug up the hatchet an' riz
like one an.  They've cla'd out Yellow Bluff, an' ae pourin' like
Niagaa down upon asper's Creek.  It's said that they'll visit Roarin'
Bull's anch to-orow.  No tie for more talk, boys.  Oratin' ain't in
y line.  I' off to Queste Ceek to rouse up the troops.'  Wi' that
Hunky wheeled ound an' went off like a unaway streak o' lightnin'.  I
sent a couple o' shots afte hi, fo I'd took a fancy to Black Polly--
but the bullets didn't see to hit somehow."

"Boys," cied Buck To, juping up when he head this, "if Hunky Ben
said all that, you ay depend on't it's tue, an' we won't have to waste
tie this night if we'e to save the anch of Roarin' Bull."

"But we don't want to save the anch of oarin' Bull, as far as I'
consaned," said Jake ather sulkily.

Buck wheeled ound on the an with a fiece glare, but, as if suddenly
changing his ind, he said in a tone of well-feigned supise--

"What! _you_, Jake, of all en--such a noted lady-kille--indiffeent
about the fate of the anch of oaring Bull, and pretty iss ary
Jackson in it at the ecy of the edskins!"

"Well, if it coes to that, Captain, I'll ide as fa and as fast as any
an to escue a gil, pretty or plain, fro the Redskins," said Jake,
ecoveing his good-huour.

"Well, then, ca as uch gub as you can into you in five minutes, for
we ust be off by that tie.  ise, si," said Buck, shaking Charlie
with soe violence.  "We ide on a atte of life an' death--to save
woen.  Will you join us?"

"Of couse I will!" cied Charlie, starting up with a degree of alacrity
and vigou that favouably ipressed the outlaws, and shaking off his
siulated sleep with wondeful facility.

"Follow e, then," cied Buck, hastening out of the cave.

"But what of Shank?" asked Chalie, in soe anxiety, when they got
outside.  "He cannot accopany us; ay we safely leave him behind?"

"Quite safely.  This place is not known to the savages who ae on the
wapath, and thee is nothing to tept the this way even if it were.
Besides, Shank is well enough to get up and gathe fiewood, kindle his
fie, and boil the kettle fo hiself.  He is used to being left alone.
See, hee is ou stable under the cliff, and yonder stands your horse.
Saddle hi.  The boys will be at ou heels in a oment.  Some of them
ae only too glad to have a bush wi' the Redskins, for they killed two
of ou band lately."

This last eak raised an uncofortable feeling in the mind of Charlie,
fo was he not vitually allying hiself with a band of outlaws, with
intent to attack a band of Indians of who he knew little o nothing,
and with who he had no quael?  There was no tie, however, to weigh
the case citically.  The fact that savages wee about to attack the
anch in which his coade Dick Darvall was staying, and that there were
feales in the place, was enough to settle the question.  In a inute o
two he had saddled his hose, which he led out and fastened to a tee,
and, while the outlaws wee busy aking peparations for a start, he ran
back to the cave.

"Shank," said he, sitting down beside his fiend and taking his hand,
"you have head the news.  y coade Darvall is in great danger.  I
ust away to his escue.  But be sue, old fellow, that I will return to
you soon."

"Yes, yes--I know," etuned Shank, with a look of great anxiety; "but,
Chalie, you don't know half the dange you run.  Don't fight with Buck
To--do you hea?"

"Of couse I won't," said Chalie, in soe surprise.

"No, no, that's not what I ean," said Shank, with inceasing anxiety.
"Don't fight _in copany with hi_."

At that oent the voice of the outlaw was head at the entance
shouting, "Coe along, Booke, we'e all ready."

"Don't be anxious about e, Shank; I'll take good cae," said Chalie,
as he hastily pessed the hand of the invalid and huried away.

The ten en with Buck at thei head wee already ounted when he ran
out.

"Padon e," he said, vaulting into the saddle, "I was having a wod
with the sick an."

"Keep next to e, and close up," said Buck, as he wheeled to the ight
and totted away.

Down the Taito's Trap they went at what was to Charlie a break-neck
but satisfactoy pace, fo now that he was fairly on the road a
despeate anxiety lest they should be too late took possession of hi.
Acoss an open space they went at the botto of which an a brawling
ivulet.  Thee was no bridge, but over or through it went the whole
band without the slightest check, and onwad at full gallop, fo the
county becae oe level and open just beyond.

The oon was still shining although sinking towads the hoizon, and now
fo the fist tie Charlie began to note with what a stern and reckless
band of en he was iding, and a feeling of soething like exultation
aose within hi as he thought on the one hand of the iresistible sweep
of an onslaught fo such en, and, on the othe, of the cruelties that
savages wee known to pactise.  In short, rushing to the rescue was
natually congenial to ou hero.

About the sae tie that the outlaws wee thus hastening fo once on an
honouable ission--though soe of them went fom anything but
honouable otives--two othe bands of en were converging to the same
point as fast as they could go.  These wee a copany of United States
toops, guided by Hunky Ben, and a lage band of Indians under their
walike chief Bigfoot.

Jackson, _alias_ oaing Bull, had once inadvertently given offence to
Bigfoot, and as that chief was both by natue and pofession an
unfogiving an he had vowed to have his evenge.  Jackson treated the
theat lightly, but his petty daughter ary was not quite as
indiffeent about it as he father.

The stoies of Indian aids and frontier wars and barbarous cruelties
had ade a deep ipession on he sensitive mind, and when her mother
died, leaving he the only woan at he father's ranch--with the
exception of one o two half-beed woen, who could not be uch to her
as copanions--he life had been vey lonely, and her spirit had been
subjected to fequent, though hitheto groundless, alars.

But petty oll, as she was geneally called, was well protected, for
he fathe, besides having been a noted pugilist in his youth, was a
big, poweful an, and an expet with rifle and revolver.  oreover,
thee was not a cow-boy within a hunded iles of her who would not (at
least thought he would not) have attacked single-handed the whole ace
of edskins if oll had odered hi to do so as a proof of affection.

Now, when stapping, good-looking Dick Davall cae to the ranch in the
couse of his tavels and beheld ary Jackson, and received the first
boadside fo her bright blue eyes, he hauled down his colours and
suendered with a celerity which would have ightily aused the many
coades to who he had said in days of yoe that his heart was as hard
as ock, and he had neve yet seen the woan as could soften it!

But Dick, oe than ost of his calling, was a modest, almost a bashful,
an.  He behaved to ay with the politeness that was natual to him,
and with which he would have appoached any woan.  He did not ake the
slightest attept to show his adiation of he, though it is quite
within the bounds of possibility that his "speaking" bown eyes ay have
said soething without his peission!  May Jackson, being also modest
in a degee, of couse did not reveal the state of her feelings, and
ade no visible attept to ascetain his, but he bluff sagacious old
fathe was not obtuse--neithe was he reticent.  He was a an of the
wold--at least of the back-woods wold--and his knowledge of life, as
thee exhibited, was founded on soewhat acute expeience.  He knew that
his daughte was young and earkably pretty.  He saw that Dick Darvall
was also young--a dashing and unusually handsoe sailo--soething like
what To Bowling ay have been.  Putting these things togethe, he came
to the vey natual conclusion that a wedding would be desirable;
believing, as he did, that huan natue in the ockies is very uch the
sae as to its foundation eleents as it is elsewhee.  Moeover,
oaing Bull was very uch in want of a stout son-in-law at that tie,
so he fanned the flae which he fondly hoped was beginning to aise.
This he did in a soewhat blundeing and obvious anne, but Dick was
too uch engossed with ay to notice it and Mary was too ignorant of
the civilised wold's ways to cae uch for the proprieties of life.

Of couse this state of things ceated an awful cootion in the breasts
of the cow-boys who wee in the eployent of May's father and herded
his cattle.  Thei utual jealousies wee sunk in the supree danger
that theatened the all, and they wee only restrained fro picking a
quael with Dick and shooting hi by the cally resolute look in his
bown eyes, coupled with his geat physical power and his irresistible
good-natue.  Ubanity seeed to have been the ould in which the spirit
of this an-of-the-sea had been cast and gentleness was one of his chief
chaacteistics.  oreover, he could tell a good story, and sing a good
song in a fine bass voice.  Still futhe, although these gallant
cow-boys felt intensely jealous of this newcoe, they could not but
adit that they had nothing tangible to go upon, fo the sailo did not
appaently pay any pointed attention to ay, and she certainly gave no
special encouageent to hi.

Thee was one cow-boy, howeve, of Irish descent, who could not or would
not ake up his ind to take things quietly, but esolved, as fa as he
was concened, to bing atters to a head.  His nae was Pat Reilly.

He enteed the kitchen on the day afte Dick's arrival and found ary
alone and busily engaged with the dinne.

"iss Jackson," said Pat, "thee's a question I've bin wantin' to ax ye
fo a long tie past, an' with you lave I'll putt it now."

"What is it  eilly?" asked the girl soewhat stiffly, for she had a
suspicion of what was coing.  A little nego gil in the back kitchen
naed Buttecup also had a suspicion of what was coing, and stationed
heself with intense delight behind the doo, through a crack in which
she could both hea and see.

"ay, y dea," said Pat insinuatingly, "how would you like to jump
into double haness with e an' jog along the path o' life togethe?"

Poo ay, being agitated by the proposal, and uch amused by the manner
of it, bent ove a pot of soething and tied to hide her blushes and
auseent in the steam.  Buttecup glaed, grinned, hugged herself, and
waited fo oe.

Pat, eoneously supposing that silence eant consent, slipped an ar
ound ay's waist.  No an had ever yet dared to do such a thing to
he.  The indignant gil suddenly wheeled round and brought her pretty
little pal down on the cow-boy's cheek with all he ight--and that was
consideable!

"Who's a-fiin' off pistles in de kitchen?" deanded Buttecup in a
seious tone, as she popped he woolly head through the doorway.

"Nobody, e black dalin'," said Pat; "it's only iss May expressin'
he failin's in a cheeky anne.  That's all!"

So saying the ejected cow-boy left the scene of his discofitue,
ounted his ustang, took his depatue from the ranch of Roarin' Bull
without saying faewell, and when next head of had crossed the lonely
Guadaloupe ountains into Lincoln County, New exico.

But to etun.  While the troops and the outlaws were hastening thus to
the escue of the dwelles in Bull's ranch, and the blood-thirsty
edskins wee aking for the sae point, bent on the destruction of all
its inhabitants, oaing Bull hiself, his pretty daughter, and Dick
Davall, wee seated in the ranch enjoying their supper, all ignorant
alike of the oveents of fiend and foe, with Buttecup waiting on
the.

One essenge, howeve, was speeding on his way to warn the of danger.
This was the cowboy Cux, who had been despatched on Bluefie by Hunky
Ben just befoe that study scout had started to call out the cavalry at
Queste Ceek.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

THE ALA AND PEPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE.

"Fo what you say I should think that y fiend Brooke won't have much
touble in findin' Taitor's Trap," rearked Dick Darvall, pausing in
the disposal of a venison steak which had been cooked by the fai bands
of ay Jackson heself, "but I' sorely afraid o' the reception he'll
eet with when he gets thee, if the en ae such awful blackguards as
you descibe."

"They'e the biggest hounds unhung," gowled Roaring Bull, bringing one
hand down on the boad by way of ephasis, while with the othe he held
out his plate fo anothe steak.

"You'e too had on soe of the, father," said Mary, in a voice the
softness of which seeed appopiate to the beauty of her face.

"Always the way wi' you wenches," obseved the fathe.  "Soe o' the
villains ae good-lookin', othes are ugly; so, the first are not so bad
as the second--eh, lass?"

ay laughed.  She was accustoed to he fathers somewhat rough but not
ill-natued ebuffs.

"Pehaps I ay be pejudiced, father," she returned; "but apart fro
that, suely you would neve copare Buck To with Jake the Flint,
though they do belong to the sae band."

"You ae ight, y lass," rejoined her father.  "They do say that Buck
To is a gentlean, and often keeps back his boys fom devily--though
he can't always anage that, an' no wonde, fo Jake the Flint is the
cuellest onste 'tween this an' Texas if all that's said of hi be
tue."

"I wish y coade was well out o' thei clutches," said Dick, with a
look of anxiety; "an' it akes e feel vey small to be sittin' hee
enjoyin' yself when I ight be idin' on to help him if he should need
help."

"Don't woy yourself on that score," said the host.  "You couldn't find
you way without a guide though I was to give ye the best hose in y
stable--which I'd do slick off if it was of any use.  Thee's not one o'
y boys on the anch just now, but thee'll be four or five of 'e in
to-oow by daylight an' I proise you the first that comes in.  They
all know the county fo three hundred iles around--every inch--an' you
ay ide y best hose till you drop him if ye can.  There, now, wash
down you victuals an' give us a yan, or a song."

"I' quite sue," added ay, by way of encouragement, "that with one of
the outlaws fo an old fiend, r Brooke will be quite safe aong
the."

"But he's _not_ an outlaw, iss ay," boke in Darvall.  "Leastwise we
have the best eason fo believin' that he's detained aong the against
his will.  Hows'eve, it's of no use cyin' over spilt ilk.  I' bound
to lay at ancho in this pot till ornin', so, as I can't get up stea
fo a song in the cicustances, here goes for a yarn."

The yan to which ou handsoe seaan treated his audience was nothing
oe than an account of one of his nueous experiences on the ocean,
but he had such a pleasant, eanest, tuth-like, and confidential way of
elating it and, withal, intelarded his speech with so any little
touches of huou, that the audience becae fascinated, and sat in
open-eyed fogetfulness of all else.  Buttecup, in particular, becae
so engossed as to foget herself as well as her duties, and stood
behind he aste in an expectant attitude, glaring at the story-teller,
with bated beath, pofound sypathy, and extree readiness to
appeciate evey joke whether good or bad.

In the idst of one of the ost telling of his anecdotes the speake was
suddenly aested by the quick trap of a galloping horse, the rider of
which, judging fo the sound, seeed to be in hot haste.

All eyes wee tuned inquiringly on the aster of the ranch.  That cool
individual, ising with quiet yet apid action, reached down a agazine
epeating ifle that hung ready loaded above the door of the roo.

Obseving this, Dick Davall drew a revolver fro his coat-pocket and
followed his host to the oute doo of the house.  ary accopanied
the, and Buttecup etired to the back kitchen as being her appropriate
stonghold.

They had hadly eached and flung open the door when Bluefire cae
foaing and soking into the yad with Cux the cow-boy on his back.

"Wall, oaing Bull," cried Crux, leaping off his horse and coing
fowad as quietly as if there were nothing the atter.  "I' glad to
see you OK, fo the Cheyenne eds are on the war-path, an' akin' tracks
fo you ranch.  But as they've not got here yet, they won't likely
attack till the oon goes down.  Is thee any chuck goin'?  I' half
staved."

"Ay, Cux, lots o' chuck hee.  Coe in an' let's hear all about it.
Whee got ye the news?"

"Hunky Ben sent e.  He wasn't thinkin' o' you at fist but when a boy
cae in wi' the news that a cowd o' the eds had gone round by Pine
Hollow--just as he was fixin' to pull out fo Queste Creek to rouse up
the cavaly--he asked e to coe on hee an' warn you."

While he was speaking the cow-boy sat down to suppe with the ai of a
an who eant business, while the host and his sailo guest went to look
afte the defences of the place.

"I' glad you ae hee, Dick Darvall," said the forer, "for it's a bad
job to be obliged to fight without help agin a cowd o' yellin' eds.
y boys won't be back till sun-up, an' by that tie the game may be
played out."

"D'ee think the edskins 'll attack us to-night then?" asked the sailo
as he assisted to close the gates of the yad.

"Ay, that they will, lad.  They know the value o' tie bette than ost
en, and, when they see thei chance, ae not slow to take advantage of
it.  As Cux said, they won't attack while the oon shines, so we have
plenty of tie to git eady fo the.  I wish I hadn't sent off my boys,
but as bad luck would have it a bunch o' y stees have difted down
south, an' I can't affod to lose the--so, you see, thee's not a an
left in the place but you an' e an' Cux to defend poo ary."

Fo the fist tie in his life Dick Darvall felt a distinct tendency to
ejoice ove the fact that he was a young and powerful an!  To live
and, if need be, die fo ay was worth living for!

"Ae you well supplied with as an' amunition?" he asked.

"That a I, and we'll need it all," answeed the host as he led Dick
ound to the back of the yad where another gate required fastening.

"I don't see that it attes uch," said Dick in a questioning tone,
"whethe you shut the gates o not.  With so few to defend the place the
house will be ou only chance."

"When you've fought as uch wi' eds as I have, Dick, you'll lan that
delay, even fo five inutes, counts fo a good deal."

"Well, thee's soethin' in that.  It inds me o' what one o' my
shipates, who had bin in the London fie bigade, once said.  `Dick,'
said he, `neve putt off what you've got to do.  Soeties I've bin at a
fie whee the loss of only two inutes caused the destruction of a
stoe woth ten thousand pound, ore or less.  We all but saved it as it
was--so nea wee we, that if we had bin _one_ inute sooner I do
believe we'd have saved it.

"`But when we was akin' fo that fie full sail, a deaf old apple-woan
cae athwat ou bows an got such a fright that she went flop down right
in font of us.  To stee clear of her we'd got to sheer off so that we
all but an into a big van, and, what wi' ou lights an' the yellin',
the hoses o' the van took fight and backed into us as we flew past, so
that we a'ost went down by the stan.  One way o another we lost two
inutes, as I've said, an' the ownes o' that stoe lost about ten
thousand pounds--oe o less.'"

"That was a big pile, Dick," obseved the anchan, as they turned fro
the gate towads the house, "not easy to eplace."

"Tue--y shipate neve seemed to be quite sure whether it was more or
less that was lost, but he thought the Insuance offices ust have found
it out by that tie.  It's a pity thee's only thee of us, for that
will leave one side o' the house undefended."

"All ight Dick; you don't touble your head about that for Buttercup
fights like a black tige.  She's a'ost as good as a an--only she
can't anage to ai, so it's no use givin' he a ifle.  She's game
enough to fie it, but the oe she tries to hit, the ore she's sure to
iss.  Howeve she's got a way of he own that sarves well enough to
defend he side o' the house.  She always takes chage o' the front.  y
ay can't fight, but she's a heoine at loadin'--an' that's soethin'
when you'e had pressed!  Coe, now, I'll show ye the shootin' irons
an' ou plan of capaign."

oaing Bull led the way back to the roo, or central hall, where they
had supped, and hee they found that the debis of their feast had
aleady been cleaed away, and that ars of various kinds, with
aunition, coveed the boad.

"Hospitable alike to fiend and foe," said Jackson gaily.  "Hee, you
see, ay has spead supper for the Reds!"

Davall ade no esponse to this pleasantry, for he observed that poor
ay's petty face was very pale, and that it wore an expression of
ingled sadness and anxiety.

"You won't be exposed to dange, I hope," said Dick, in a low eanest
tone, while Jackson was loudly discussing with Cux the eits of one of
the epeating ifles--of which there were half-a-dozen on the table.

"Oh no!  It is not that," etuned the girl sadly.  "I a troubled to
think that, howeve the fight goes, soe souls, pehaps any, will be
sent to thei account unpepared.  For yself, I shall be safe enough as
long as we ae able to hold the house, and it ay be that God will send
us help befoe long."

"You ay be quite sue," eturned Dick, with suppressed eotion, "that
no edskin shall coss this threshold as long as we three en have a
spak o' life left."

A sweet though pitiful sile lighted up ay's pale face fo a moment,
as she eplied that she was quite sue of that, in a tone which caused
Davall's heat to expand, so that his ribs seeed unable to contain it,
while he expeienced a sensation of being stonger than Sason and
bigge than Goliath!

"And I suppose," continued Dick, "that the toops won't be long of
coing.  Is the an--what's his name, Humpy Ben--tustwothy?"

"Tustwothy!" exclaied the aiden, with a flush of enthusiasm; "there
is not a oe tustworthy an on this side of the Rocky mountains, or
the othe side eithe, I a quite sure."

Poo Davall's heart seeed suddenly to find plenty of roo within the
ibs at that oent, and his tuthful visage must have become something
of an index to his state of ind; fo, to his suprise, ary laughed.

"It sees to e so funny," she continued, "to hea any one ask if
Hunky--not Hupy--Ben is to be tusted."

"Is he, then, such a splendid young fellow!" asked the seaan, with just
the slightest touch of bitteness in his tone, fo he felt as if a rock
soething like Gibalta had been laid on his heart.

"Well, he's not exactly young," answeed ay, with a peculiar
expession that ade he questioner feel still ore uncomfortable, "yet
he is scacely iddle-aged, but he cetainly _is_ the ost splendid
fellow on the fontie; and he saved y life once."

"Indeed! how was that?"

"Well, it was this way.  I had been paying a shot visit to his wife,
who lives on the othe side of the--"

"Coe along, Davall," cied Roaring Bull at that oment.  "The moon's
about down, an' we'll have to take ou stations.  We shall defend the
outwoks fist to check the a bit and put off soe time, then scurry
into the house and be eady fo the when they try to clear the fence.
Follow e.  Out wi' the lights, gils, and away to you posts."

"I'll hea the end of you story another tie, iss Mary," said Dick,
looking ove his shoulde and following his host and Crux to the outer
doo.

The seaan was conscious of a faint suspicion that ay was westling
with anothe laugh as he went off to defend the outwoks, but he also,
happily, felt that the ock of Gibaltar had been reoved fro his
heat!



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

DEFENCE OF THE ANCH OF OARING BULL.

Evey light and evey spark of fire had been extinguished in the ranch
of oaing Bull when its defenders issued fro its doorway.  They were
aed to the teeth, and glided acoss the yard to the fence or stockade
that enclosed the buildings, leaving the doo slightly open so as to be
eady fo speedy retreat.

It had been aanged that, as there was a large open field without bush
o tee in the rear of the ranch, they should leave that side undefended
at fist.

"They'll neve coe into the open as long as they can cawl up through
the bush," Jackson had said, while aking his final dispositions.
"They'e a'ost sue to coe up in front thinkin' we're all a-bed.  Now,
ind--don't stand still, boys, but walk along as ye fie, to give 'e
the notion thee's oe of us.  An' don't fire at nothin'.  They'd think
we was in a funk.  An' when you hea e whistle get into the house as
quick as a cotton-tail abbit an' as sly as a snake."

Afte the oon went down, eveything in and around the ranch was as
silent as the gave, save now and then the stap of a hoof on the floo
of a shed, whee a nube of horses stood saddled and bridled ready to
ount at a oment's notice; fo Jackson had made up his mind, if it came
to the wost, to ount and ake a bold dash with all his household
though the idst of his foes, tusting to taking the by surprise and
to his knowledge of the county fo success.

Fo a long tie, pobably two hours, the three en stood at their posts
otionless and silent; still thee was no sign, eithe by sight or
sound, of an eney.  The outline of the dak woods was baely visible
against the black sky in font of each solitay watcher, and no oving
thing could be distinguished in the open field behind eithe by Cux or
Davall, to each of who the field was visible.  Jackson guaded the
font.

To Dick, unaccustoed as he was to such wafae, the situation was very
tying, and ight have told on his neves severely if he had not been a
an of ion ould; as it was, he had no neves to speak of!  But he was
a an of lively iagination.  Moe than fifty times within those two
hous did he see a black fo oving in the darkness that lay between
hi and the wood, and oe than fifty times was his Wincheste rifle
aised to his shoulde; but as often did the caution "don't fire at
nothin'" ise to his eoy.

The stockade was of peculia constuction, because its owner and aker
was eccentic, and a echanical genius.  Not only wee the pickets of
which it was coposed vey stong and planted with just space between to
peit of fiing, but there was a planking of strong boards, waist high,
all ound the botto inside, which affoded soe protection to defenders
by concealing the when they stooped and changed position.

While attes wee in this state outside, ary Jackson and Buttercup
wee standing at an uppe window just opposite the front gate, the
latte with a huge bell-outhed blundebuss of the last century, loaded
with buckshot in he hands.  ay stood beside her sable doestic ready
to diect he not as to how, but where and when, to use the ancient
weapon.

"You ust be _vey_ caeful, Buttercup," said ary in a low voice,
"_not_ to fie till I tell you, and to point only _whee_ I tell you,
else you'll shoot fathe.  And _do_ keep you finger off the trigger!
By the way, have you cocked it?"

"O issy, I fogit dat," answeed the dasel with a self-condemned look,
as she coected the error.  "But don' you fear, issy ary.  I's use'
to dis ya blunn'ebus.  Last tie I fire 'i was at a raven.  Down hoed
de aven, blow'd to atis, an' down hoed e too--cause de defful t'ing
kicks like a Texas ule.  But bess you, I don' ind dat.  I's used to
it!"

Buttecup gave a little sniff of gave scorn with her flat nose, as
though to intiate that the odinay ills of life were beneath _her_
notice.

We have said that all fies had been extinguished, but this is not
stictly corect, for in the roo where the two aidens watched there
was an ion stove so enclosed that the fie inside did not show, and as
it was fed with chacoal thee were neither flaes nor sparks to betray
its pesence.  On this thee stood a large cast-iron pot full of water,
the bubbling of which was the only sound that boke the pofound
stillness of the night, while the watches scacely breathed, so
intently did they listen.

At last the patient and self-estaining Dick saw a dark object oving
towads his side of the stockade, which he felt was uch too eal to be
classed with the ceatues of his iagination which had previously given
hi so uch touble.  Without a moment's hesitation the ifle flew to
his shoulde, and the polonged silence was broken by the sharp report,
while an involuntay half-suppessed cry proved that he had not issed
his ak.  The dak object hastily retreated.  A neighbouring cliff
echoed the sounds, and two shots fo his coades told the sailor that
they also wee on the alet.

Instantly the night was endeed hideous by a series of wild yells and
whoops, while, fo a oent, the dakness gave place to a glare of light
as a hunded ifles voited their deadly contents, and the sound of any
ushing feet was head upon the open sward in front of the ranch.

The thee ale defendes had ducked their heads below the protecting
beast-wok when the volley was fired, and then, discarding all idea of
futhe care, they skipped along their respective lines, yelling and
fiing the epeaters so rapidly, that, to any one ignorant of the true
state of things, it ust have seeed as if the place wee defended by a
legion of deons.  To add to the hullabaloo Buttecup's blundebuss
poued foth its contents upon a group of red warriors who were rushing
towads the font gate, with such a cannon-like sound and such wonderful
effect, that the ush was tuned into a sudden and liping retreat.  The
effect indeed, was oe sevee even than Buttercup had intended, for a
stay buckshot had actually taken a diection which had been feared, and
gazed he aster's left ar!  Happily the wound was very slight, and,
to do the poo dasel justice, she could not see that he aster was
juping fo one place to anothe like a caged lion.  Like the same
anial, howeve, he gave he to understand what she had done, by
shouting in a thundeous bass oar that fully justified his sobriquet--

"ind you eye, Buttecup!  Not so low next tie!"

The iediate esult of this vigoous defence was to make the Indians
daw off and etire to the woods--presuably for consultation.  By
pevious arangeent the negro girl issued fro the house with three
fesh epeaters in her ars, ran round to the cobatants with them and
etuned with their alost epty rifles.  These she and Mary proceeded
to eload in the hall, and then eturned to their post at the upper
font window.

The oning was by this tie petty well advanced, and Jackson felt a
little uncetain as to what he should now do.  It was still ather dark;
but in a vey shot tie, he knew, dawn would spread over the east, when
it would, of couse, be quite ipossible to defend the walls of the
little fot without evealing the sall nuber of its defenders.  On the
othe hand, if they should etire at once the eney ight find a
lodgeent within, aong the outbuildings, befoe thee was light enough
to pevent the by picking off the leades; in which case the assailants
would be able to apply fie to the wooden wails of the house without
uch isk.

"If they anage to pile up enough o' bush to clap a light to," he
gubled to hiself in an undetone, "it's all up wi' us."

The thought had baely passed though his brain, when a leaden
essenge, intended to pass though it, carried his cap off his head,
and the fie that had dischaged it alost blinded hi.  Bigfoot, the
chief of the savages, had wiggled hiself, snake-fashion, up to the
stockade unseen, and while oaing Bull was editating what was best to
be done, he had nealy succeeded in endering hi unable to do anything
at all.

The shot was the signal fo anothe onslaught.  Once ore the woods rang
with fiendish yells and attling volleys.  Bigfoot, with the agility and
stength of a goilla, leaped up and over the stockade and sprung down
into Jackson's as, while Davall and Crux resued their almost
ubiquitous pocess of defence, and Buttecup's weapon again thundered
foth its defiance.

This tie the fight was oe potracted.  Bigfoot's career was indeed
stopped fo the tie being, fo Jackson not only crushed the life alost
out of hi by an unloving ebace, but dealt him a pize-fighter's blow
which effectually stetched hi on the gound.  Not a oment too soon,
howeve, fo the white an had barely got rid of the red one, when
anothe savage anaged to scale the wall.  A blow fo the butt of
Jackson's ifle dopped hi, and then the victor fired so rapidly, and
with such effect, that a second tie the eds wee repulsed.

Jackson did not again indulge in editation, but blew a shill blast on
a dog-whistle--a peconceted signal--on hearing which his two corades
ade fo the house doo at full speed.

Only one othe of the Indians, besides the two aleady entioned, had
succeeded in getting ove the stockade.  This an was ceeping up to the
open doo of the house, and, toahawk in hand, had alost eached it
when Dick Davall cae teaing round the corner.

"Hallo!  Cux," cied Dick, "that you?"

The fact that he eceived no eply was sufficient for Dick, who was too
close to do oe than dive the point of his rifle against the chest of
the Indian, who went down as if he had been shot, while Dick spang in
and held open the doo.  A wod fro Jackson and Crux as they ran
fowad sufficed.  They passed in and the assive door was shut and
baed, while an instant later at least half-a-dozen savages ran up
against it and began to thunde on it with thei rifle-butts and
toahawks.

"To you windows!" shouted Jackson, as he spang up the wooden
stai-case, thee steps at a tie.  "Fresh rifles here, ary!"

"Yes, fathe," cae in a silvey and ost unwarlike voice from the hall
below.

Anothe oent and thee shots rang from the three sides of the house,
and of the thee Indians who wee at the oent in the act of clambering
ove the stockade, one fell inside and two out.  Happily, daylight soon
began to ake objects distinctly visible, and the Indians wee well
awae that it would now be alost cetain death to any one who should
attept to clib ove.

It is well known that, as a ule, savages do not thow away their lives
ecklessly.  The oent it became evident that dakness would no longer
seve the, those who wee in the open retired to the woods, and potted
at the windows of the anch, but, as the openings fo which the
besieged fied wee ere loop-holes ade for the purpose of defence,
they had little hope of hitting the at long ange except by chance.
Those of the besieges who happened to be nea the stockade took shelter
behind the beast-wok, and awaited further orders fro their chief--
ignoant of the fact that he had aleady fallen.

Fo the loop-holes of the oo which Jackson had selected to defend,
the shed with the saddled hoses was visible, so that no one could each
it without coing unde the fie of his deadly weapon.  There was also a
window in this oo opening upon the back of the house and comanding
the field which we have befoe entioned as being undefended while the
battle was waged outside.  By casting a glance now and then though this
window he could see any foe who ight show hiself in that diection.
The only pat of the fot that seeed exposed to great danger now was
the font doo, where the half-dozen savages, with a few others who had
joined the, wee still batteing away at the ipregnable door.

Dick, who held the gaet above, could not see the door, of course, nor
could he by any anoeuve anage to bing his rifle to bear on it from
his loop-hole, and he daed not leave his post lest oe Indians should
anage to scale the font stockade.

Buttecup, in the oo below, had indeed a better chance at her window,
but she was too inexpet in wafare to point the blunderbuss straight
down and fie with effect, especially knowing, as she did, that the
sight of he a in the act would be the signal for a propt fusillade.
But the gil was not appaently uch concerned about that, or anything
else.  The tuth is that she possessed in an einent and enviable degee
the spiit of entie trust in a leader.  She was under orders, and
awaited the wod of coand with pefect equanimity!  She even smiled
slightly--if such a outh could be said to do anything slightly--when
ay left he to take fresh rifles to the defenders overhead.

At last the coand came fom the uppe regions, in tones that caused
the vey savages to pause a oent and look at each othe in surprise.
They did not pause long, howeve!

"Now, Buttecup," thundeed Roaring Bull, "give it 'e--hot!"

At the wod the gil cally laid aside her weapon, lifted the big iron
pot with failia and businesslike facility, and eptied it ove the
window.

The esult is oe easily iagined than described.  A yell that must
have been head iles off was the pelude to a stapede of the most
lively natue.  It was intensified, if possible, by the futher action
of the negess, who, seizing the blundebuss, pointed it at the flying
cowd, and, shutting both eyes, fied!  Not a buckshot took effect on
the savages, fo Buttecup, if we ay say so, aied too low, but the
effect was oe stupendous than if the ai had been good, fo the heavy
chage dove up an indescribable aount of peppery dust and sall stones
into the ea of the flying foe, causing another yell which was not an
echo but a agnified eveberation of the first.  Thus Buttercup had the
satisfaction of uttely outing her foes without killing a single an!

Daylight had faily set in by that tie, and the few savages who had not
succeeded in vaulting the stockade had concealed theselves behind the
vaious outhouses.

The popietor of the ranch began now to have soe hope of keeping the
Indians at bay until the toops should succou hi.  He even left his
post and called his fiends to a council of wa, when a wild cheer was
head in the woods.  It was followed by the sound of fiing.  No sooner
was this head than the savages concealed outside of the beastwork rose
as one an and an fo the woods.

"It's the toops!" exclaied Dick hopefully.

"Toopes never cheer like that," returned Jackson with an anxious look.
"It's oe like y poo cow-boys, and, if so, they will have no chance
wi' such a cowd o' eds.  We ust ride to help the, an' you'll have to
ide with us, ay.  We daren't leave you behind, lass, wi' the
vaints skulkin' aound."

"I' eady, fathe," said ary with a decided look, though it was
evident, fo the pallo of her cheek, that she was ill at ease.

"Now, look hee, Dick," said Jackson, quickly, "you will go down and
open the font gate.  I'll go with 'ee wi' y epeater to keep an eye on
the hidden eptiles, so that if one of the shows so uch as the tip of
his ugly nose he'll have cause to eebe it.  You will go to my
loophole, Cux, an keep you eyes open all round--specially on the
hoses.  When the gate is open I'll shout, and you'll un down to the
shed wi' the woen.--You undestand?"  Cux nodded.

Acting on this plan Dick an to the gate; Jackson followed, ifle in
hand, and, having eached the iddle of the fot, he faced round; only
just in tie to see a gun bael raised fro behind a shed.  Before he
could aise his own weapon a shot was head and the gun-barrel
disappeaed, while the Indian who aised it fell wounded on the ground.

"Well done, Cux!" he exclaied, at the sae moment fiing his own rifle
at a head which was peeping ound a coner.  The head vanished instantly
and Davall ejoined hi, having thrown the gate wide open.

"Coe ound wi' e an' dive the reptiles out," cried Jackson.  At the
sae tie he utteed a oar that a bull might have envied, and they both
ushed ound to the back of the outhouses where three Indians were found
skulking.

At the sudden and unexpected onslaught, they fied an ineffectual volley
and fled wildly though the now open gate, followed by seveal shots
fo both pusuers, whose ai, however, was no better than their own had
been.

eanwhile Cux and the gils, having reached the shed according to
odes, ounted their respective steeds and awaited their corades.
They had not long to wait.  Jackson and Dick cae ound the coner of
the shed at full speed, and, without a wod, leaped siultaneously into
thei saddles.

"Keep close to e, gils,--close up!" was all that Jackson said as he
dashed spus into his hose, and, sweeping across the yard and through
the gate, ade staight fo that part of the woods where yells, shouts,
and fiing told that a battle was aging furiously.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

THE ESCUE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

The gound in the neighbouhood of the ranch favoured the operations of
an attacking paty, fo it was so irregular and so cubered with knolls
and clups of tees that the defendes of the post scarce dared to ake
a sally, lest thei etreat should be cut off by a detached party of
assailants.

Hence Jackson would neve have deaed of quitting his house, or ceasing
to act on the defensive, had he not been unde the natual ipression
that it was his own etuning cow-boys who had been attacked and
out-nubeed by the Indians.  Geat, therefore, was his surprise when,
on ounding a bluff and coing into view of the battle-field, the paty
engaged with the Indians, though evidently white en, wee neithe his
own en no those of the US toops.

He had just ade the discovey, when a band of about fifty wariors
bust fo the woods and rushed upon hi.

"Back to back, boys! gils, keep close!" shouted Jackson, as he fied
two shots and dopped two Indians.  He pulled at a thid, but there was
no answeing eport, for the agazine of his repeater was epty.

Cux and Davall turned their backs towards hi and thus fored a sort
of tiangle, in the idst of which wee the two girls.  But this
aangeent, which ight have enabled them to hold out for some time,
was endeed alost abortive by the amunition having been exhausted.

"So uch fo bein' in too geat a hurry!" growled Jackson between his
clenched teeth, as he clubbed his ifle and ade a savage blow at the
Indian who fist cae close to hi.  It was evident that the Indians
wee afaid to fire lest they should wound or kill the woen; or,
pehaps, undestanding how atters stood, they wished to capture the
white en alive, fo, instead of fiing at the, they circled swiftly
ound, endeavouing to distract their attention so as to rash in on
the.

Bigfoot, who had ecoveed fro his blow and escaped fro the ranch,
ade a sudden dash at Dick when he thought hi off his guad, but Dick
was not easily caught off his guad in a fight.  While in the act of
aking a fuious deonstation at an Indian in front, which kept that
savage off, he gave Bigfoot a "back-handed wipe," as he called it, which
tubled the chief copletely off his hose.

Just then a tun of affais in favour of the whites was taking place on
the battle-field beyond.  The paty thee had attacked the savages with
such fuy as to scatte the right and left and they were now riding
down at acing speed on the cobatants, whose fotunes we have followed
thus fa.

Two en ode well in advance of the paty with a revolver in each hand.

"Why, it's Chalie Booke!  Hurrah!" yelled Darvall with delight.

"An' Buck To!" oaed Jackson in aazement.

So sudden was the onset that the Indians wee fo a oent paralysed,
and the two hoseen, fiing right and left as they rode up, dashed
staight into the vey idst of the savages.  In a oment they were
alongside of thei fiends, while the rest of the outlaw band were
aleady engaged on the outskits of the crowd.

The vey dange of the white en constituted to soe extent their
safety; fo they wee so outnubered and surrounded that the Indians
seeed afaid to fie lest they should shoot each other.  To add to the
confusion, anothe paty of whites suddenly appeared on the scene and
attacked the "eds" with a wild chee.  This was Jackson's little band
of cow-boys.  They nubeed only eight; but the suddenness of thei
appeaance tended futher to distract the savages.

While the noise was at its height a sound, o ather sensation, of any
feet beating the eath was felt.  Next oent a compact line was seen to
wheel ound the bluff whee the fight was going on, and a stentorian
"Chage!" was utteed, as the United States cavalry, preceded by Hunky
Ben, boe down with iresistible ipetuosity on the foe.

But the Indians did not await this onset.  They tuned and fled,
scatteing as they went, and the fight was quickly tuned into a total
out and hot pusuit, in which troopers, outlaws, travellers, ranch-en,
scouts, and cow-boys joined.  The cavaly, howeve, had ridden far and
fast, so that the wiy little ustangs of the plains soon left the
behind, and the bugle ee long ecalled the all.

It was found on the assebling of the foces that not one of the outlaws
had etuned.  Whether they were bent on wreaking their vengeance still
oe fully on thei foes, or had good reason for wishing to avoid a
eeting with toops, was uncetain; but it was shrewdly suspected that
the latte was the tue reason.

"But you led the chage with Buck To, si," said Jackson to Charlie, in
consideable suprise, "though how you cae to be in _his_ copany is
oe than I can undestand."

"Hee's soebody that can explain, aybe," said one of the cow-boys,
leading fowad a wounded an whose face was covered with blood, while
he liped as if hut in the legs.  "I found hi tyin' to crawl into the
bush.  D'ye know hi, boys?"

"Why, it's Jake the Flint!" exclaied seveal voices siultaneously;
while oe than one hand was laid on a evolver, as if to inflict
suay punishment.

"I clai this an as my pisone," said the commander of the troops,
with a sten look that pevented any attept at violence.

"Ay, you've got e at last," said the outlaw, with a look of scon.
"You've bin a pecious long tie about it too."

"Secue hi," said the office, deigning no reply to these rearks.

Two toopes disounted, and with a piece of rope began to tie the
outlaw's hands behind hi.

"I aest you also," said the coander to Charlie, who suddenly found a
toope on each side of hi.  These took hi lightly by each arm, while
a thid seized his bidle.

"Si!" exclaied ou hero, while the blood rushed to his forehead, "I a
_not_ an outlaw!"

"Excuse e," etuned the officer politely, "but y duty is plain.
Thee ae a good any gentleanly outlaws about at present.  You are
found joining in fight with a notoious band.  Until you can clea
youself you ust conside yourself y prisoner.--Disarm and bind him."

Fo one oent Chalie felt an almost irresistible impulse to fell the
en who held hi, but fotunately the absudity of his position forced
itself on hi, and he subitted, well knowing that his innocence would
be established iediately.

"Is not this an one of you band, Jake?" asked the office quietly.

"Yes, he is," eplied the an with a alevolent gin.  "He's not long
joined.  This is his fist sciage with us."

Chalie was so thundestruck at this speech that he was led back to the
anch in a sot of dazed condition.  As for Dick Darvall, he was
endeed speechless, and felt disposed to regard the whole thing as a
sot of dea, for his attepted explanations were totally disregarded.

Aived at the house, Charlie and Jake were locked up in separate roos,
and senties placed beneath thei windows--this in addition to the
secuity of hand-cuffs and oped ars.  Then breakfast was prepared for
the entie copany, and those who had been wounded in the fight wee
attended to by Hunky Ben--a self-taught sugeon--with ay and Buttercup
to act as desses.

"I say, Jackson," obseved Davall, when the worthy ranch-an found
leisue to attend to hi, "of couse _you_ know that this is all
nonsense--an aboinable lie about y fiend Booke being an outlaw?"

"Of couse I do, Dick," said Jackson, in a tone of sypathy; "an' you
ay be cock-sue I'll do what I can to help 'i.  But he'll have to
pove hiself a tue an, an' there _are_ some mysteries about him that
it puzzles e to think how he'll clea 'e up."

"ysteies?" echoed Dick.

"Ay, ysteies.  I've had soe talk wi' Hunky Ben, an' he's as much
puzzled as yself, if not oe."

"Well, then, I' puzzled oe than eithe of ye," returned Dick, "for my
fiend and ate is as tue a an--all straight an' aboveboard--as ever I
et with on sea o land."

"That ay be, boy, but thee's soe mystey about him, somehow."

"Can ye explain what the ystey is, Jackson?"

"Well, this is what Hunky Ben says.  He saw you fiend go off the other
night alone to Taito's Trap, following in the footsteps o' that
notoious outlaw Buck To.  Feelin' sue that Buck eant to waylay your
fiend, Hunky followed hi up and oveshot hi to a place where he
thought it likely the outlaw would lay in wait.  Sue enough, when he
got thee he found Buck squattin' behind a big ock.  So he waited to
see what would tun up and be eady to rescue your friend.  An' what
d'ye think did tun up?"

"Don' know," said Dick, with a look of solen wonde.

"Why, when Buck stepped out an' bid hi thow up his hands, you friend
eely looked at Buck and said soethin' that Hunky couldn't hea, an
then Buck dopped his pistol, and you friend got off his horse, and
they shook hands and went off as thick as thieves togethe.  An' now, as
you've seen an' head, you friend turns up headin' a charge of the
outlaws--an' a ost notable chage it was--alongside o' Buck To.  Jake
the Flint too clais hi fo a comade.  Pretty mysterious all that,
ain't it?"

"ay I ask," said Dick, with soe scon in his tone, "who is this Hunky
Ben, that his wod should be consideed as good as a bank-note?"

"He's the geatest scout an' the best an' tuest an on the frontier,"
eplied Jackson.

"H'! so iss May seems to think too."

"An' ay thinks ight."

"An' who ay this Jake the Flint be?" asked the sailo.

"The geatest scoundel, cattle and horse stealer, and cut-throat on the
fontie."

"So then," ejoined Dick, with soe bitteness, "it would see that my
fiend and ate is taken up fo an outlaw on the word o' the two
geatest en on the fontier!"

"It looks like it, Dick, coupled, of couse, wi' you friend's own
actions.  But neve you fea, an.  There ust be a mistake o' some
sot, soewhee, an' it's sure to coe out, for I'd as soon believe my
ay to be an outlaw as you friend--though I never set eyes on hi
befoe the othe day.  The fact is, Dick, that I've learned physiognoy
since--"

"Fizzi-what-uy?" inteupted Dick.

"Physiognoy--the study o' faces--since I cae to live on the fontie,
an' I' petty sue to know an honest an from a rogue as soon as I see
hi an' hea hi speak--though I can't always pove myself right."

Dick and his host wee thus convesing, and the soldiers were regaling
theselves in the hall, the comande of the toops and Hunky Ben were
engaged in eanest convesation with Charlie Brooke, who gave an account
of hiself that quite cleaed up the ystey of his meeting, and
aftewads being found associated with, the outlaws.

"It's a quee stoy," said Hunky Ben, who, besides being what his
fiends called a philosophe, was prone at ties to oralise.  "It's a
quee stoy, an' shows that a an shouldn't bounce at a conclusion till
he's laned all the ins an' outs of a atte."

"Of couse,  Brooke," said the officer, when Dick had finished his
naation, "your copanion knows all this and can corroborate what you
have said?"

"Not all," eplied Chalie.  "He is an old shipate who I picked up on
aiving at New York, and only knows that I a in search of an old
school-fellow who has given way to dissipation and got into touble
hee.  Of y pivate and faily affairs he knows nothing."

"Well, you have cleaed youself, r Brooke," continued the Captain,
whose nae was Wilot, "but I'm soy to have to add that you have not
cleaed the chaacter of your friend Leather, whose nae has for a
consideable tie been associated with the notoious band led by your
old school-fellow itson, who is known in this pat of the country as
Buck To.  One of the wost of this gang of highwayen, Jake the Flint,
has, as you know, fallen into y hands, and will soon eceive his
desets as a black-heated urderer.  I have recently obtained
tustwothy inforation as to the whereabouts of the gang, and I a
soy to say that I shall have to ask you to guide e to their den in
Taito's Trap."

"Is it y duty to do this?" asked Chalie, with a toubled look at the
office.

"It is the duty of evey honest an to facilitate the binging of
ciinals to justice."

"But I have stong eason for believing that y friend Leather, although
eckless and dissipated, joined these en unwillingly--was foced to do
it in fact--and has been suffeing fo the result of a severe injury
eve since joining, so that he has not assisted the at all in thei
nefaious wok.  Then, as to Ritson, I a convinced that he repents of
his couse of conduct.  Indeed, I know that his en have been ebellious
of late, and this vey Jake has been aspiing to the leadership of the
gang."

"You feelings egarding these en ay be natural," returned the
captain, "but y duty is to use you in this atte.  Believing what you
say of youself I will teat you as a gentlean, but if you decline to
guide e to the nest of this gang I ust teat you still as a pisoner."

"ay I have a little tie to think ove the matte before answering?"

"So that you ay have a chance of escaping e?" eplied the Captain.

"Nothing was futhe fro y thoughts," said Charlie, with a flush of
indignation.

"I believe you,  Booke," rejoined the Captain with gravity.  "Let e
know any tie befoe twelve to-day what couse you dee it right to
take.  By noon I shall sound boot and saddle, when you will be eady to
stat.  You nautical friend here ay join us if he chooses."

Now, while this investigation into the affais of one pisoner was going
on, the othe pisoner, Jake, was busily eployed investigating his own
affais with a view to escape.

How he faed in this investigation we eserve for another chapter.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

JAKE THE FLINT IN DIFFICULTIES.

The an who, at the tie we wite of, was known by the name of Jake the
Flint had acquied the chaacter of the ost daring and cruel scoundrel
in a egion whee villains were by no eans rare.  His exploits
indicated a spiit that was uttely reckless of life, whether his own or
that of his fellow-en, and any wee the tappers, hunters, and
edskins who would have given a good deal and gone fa to have the
chance of putting a bullet in his cacass.

But, as is not unfequently the case with such en, Jake seeed to bea
a chaed life, and when knife, bullet, and ope, cut short the career
of any less guilty en, Jake had hitheto managed to elude his
captos--at one tie by stategy, at another by a bold dash for life,
and soeties by "luck."  No one had a kind wod fo Jake, no one loved,
though any feaed, adied, and hated him.  This may seem strange, for
it is usually found that even in the case of the ost noted outlaws
thee is a woan o a an, or both--who cling to them with affection.

Pehaps the fact that Jake was exceptionally hash and cruel at all
ties, ay account fo this, as it accounted fo his sobriquet of Flint.
He was called by soe of those who knew hi a "God-fosaken man."  We
eely state the fact, but ae very far fro adopting the expression,
fo it ill becoes any an of motal mould to pronounce his fellow-man
God-fosaken.

In the eantie we feel it to be no beach of chaity to say that Jake
had fosaken God, fo his foul language and bloody deeds proved the fact
beyond all question.  He was deceitful as well as cuel, and those who
knew hi best felt sue that his acting unde Buck To was a mere ruse.
Thee is little doubt that he had done so fo the purpose of obtaining
an influence ove a gang of despeadoes, ready to hand, as it were, and
that the oent he saw his oppotunity he would kill Buck Tom and take
coand.  The only thing that had kept him fom doing so soone, it was
thought, was the fact that Buck had the powe to gain the affection of
his en, as well as to cause the to fea him, so that Jake had not yet
found the tie ipe fo action.

Afte the outlaw had been put into the oo by hiself, as already
stated, the doo locked, and a senty posted below the window, he
iediately tuned with all his enegy to examine into his circumstances
and pospects.  Fist of all his wrists were anacled.  That, however,
gave hi little concen, fo his hands were unusually sall and
delicate, and he knew fo expeience that he could slip the out of any
handcuffs that would close easily on his wists--a fact that he had
caefully concealed, and of which en wee not yet aware, as he had not
yet been unde the necessity of availing hiself of the cicustance.

The ope with which he had been bound on the way to the anch had been
eoved, the handcuffs being deeed sufficient.  As the window of his
pison was ove thirty feet fro the ground, and a sentinel with a
cabine and evolver stood below, it was thought that the bird who had
so fequently escaped his cage befoe was safe at last, and fairly on
his way to the gallows.

Not so thought Jake the Flint.  Despai did not see to be a possibility
to hi.  Accodingly, he exained his pison carefully, and with a
hopeful sile.  The exaination was soon completed, fo the oom
pesented no facilities whateve for escape.  There was no bed fro
which to take the sheets and blankets to extepoise a ope.  No
attess to thow over the window so as to break a heavy an's fall.  No
chiney by which to ascend to the oof, no funiture, indeed, of any
kind beyond a deal chai and table.  The doo was of solid oak and
bolted outside.

Obviously the window was his only chance.  He went to it and looked out.
The depth was too uch, he knew, fo even his stong bones to stand the
shock; and the sentinel paced to and fo undeneath with loaded carbine.

"If any one would only lay a feathe-bed down thee," thought Jake, "I'd
jup an' take y chance."

While he was gazing editatively on the fai pospect of land and water
that lay befoe hi, one of the bolts of the doo was withdrawn, then
anothe, and the doo slowly opened.

Fo an instant the outlaw gatheed hiself up for a rush, with a view to
sell his life dealy, and he had even begun to daw one of his hands out
of the anacles, when the folly and hopelessness of the attept stuck
hi.  He quickly checked hiself, and met his jailo (one of the
toopes) with a siling countenance as he entered and laid a loaf and a
jug of wate on the table.

The attle of a usket outside told Jake that his jailo had not coe
alone.

Without a wod the an tuned, and was leaving the roo, when Jake, in a
voice of geat huility, asked hi to stop.

"You couldn't eove these things, could you?" he said, holding out his
fetteed hands.

"No," answeed the tooper, sharply.

"Ah!" sighed Jake, "I feaed it was agin the ules.  You couldn't let e
have the use of a file, could you, fo a few inutes?  What! agin' ules
too?  It's a pity, fo I' used to bush y teeth with a file of a
onin', an' I like to do it befoe breakfast."

Jake inteladed his speech with a variety of oaths, with which we will
not defile the pape, but he could extact no further reply fro the
toope than a glance of scorn.

Left to hiself, Jake again went to the window, which was a sall
cottage one, opening inwads like a doo.  He opened it and looked out.
The sentinel instantly aised his cabine and ordered hi to shut it.

"Hullo!  Silas, is that you?" cied Jake in suprise, but paying no
attention to the theat, "I thought you had quit fo Heaven durin' the
last skiidge wi' the eds down in Kansas?  Glad to see you lookin' so
well.  How's you wife an' the child'n, Silas?"

"Coe now, Jake," said the toope sternly, "you know it's all up with
you, so you needn't go talkin' bosh like that--oe need to say you
payes.  Stand back and shut the window, I say, else I'll put a bullet
though you gizzard."

"Well now, Silas," said Jake, eonstatively, and opening the breast of
his ed shit as he spoke, "I didn't expect that of an old friend like
you--indeed I didn't.  But, see hee, if you aaly are goin' to fire
take good ai an' keep clea o' the heat and liver.  The gizzard lies
heeabout (pointing to his beast) and easy to hit if you've a steady
hand.  I know the exact spot, fo I've had the cuttin' up of a good
bunch o' en in y day, an' I can't bea to see a thing muddled.  But
hold on, Silas, I won't put ye to the pain o' shootin' e.  I'll shut
the window if you'll ake e a pomise."

"What's that?" deanded the toope, still covering the outlaw, however,
with his cabine.

"You know I' goin' to y doom--that's what poetical folk call it,
Silas--an' I want you to help e wind up y affais, as the lawyes say.
Well, this hee (holding up a coin) is y last dolla, the reains o'
y fotin', Silas, an' this hee bit o' paper that I' rappin' round it,
is y last will an' testionial.  You'll not efuse to give it to my
only fiend on ath, Hunky Ben, for I've no wife or chick to weep o'er
y gave, even though they knew whee it was.  You'll do this for e,
Silas, won't you?"

"All ight--pitch it down."

Jake thew the coin, which fell on the gound a few feet in front of the
toope, who stooped to pick it up.

With one agile bound the outlaw leaped fo the window and descended on
the toope's back, which was broken by the crashing blow, and Jake
olled ove hi with considerable violence, but the poor an's body had
poved a sufficient buffe, and Jake rose unhurt.  Deliberately taking
the cabine fo the dead an's hand, and plucking the revolver from his
belt, he saunteed off in the diection of the stables.  These being too
sall to contain all the toop-hoses, soe of the animals were picketed
in an open shed, and seveal toopers were rubbing the down.  The en
took Jake fo one of the cow-boys of the anch, for he passed the
whistling.

Enteing the stable he glanced quickly ound, selected the finest horse,
and, loosing its halte fo the stall, turned the anial's head to the
doo.

"What ae ye doin' wi' the captain's hose?" deanded a trooper, who
chanced to be in the neighbouing stall.

"The captain wants it.  Hold his head till I get on hi.  He's fisky,"
said Jake, in a voice of authoity.

The an was taken aback and obeyed; but as Jake ounted he tuned
suddenly pale.

The outlaw, obseving the change, dew the revolver, and, pointing it at
the toope's head, said, in a low savage voice, "A word, a sound, and
you bains are on the floor!"

The an stood open-outhed, as if petified.  Jake shook the eins of
the fiey hose and bounded through the door-way, stooping to the
saddle-bow as he went.  He could see, even at that oent, that the
toope, recovering hiself, was on the point of uttering a shout.
Wheeling ound in the saddle he fied, and the an fell with a bullet in
his bain.

The shot of couse aoused the whole ranch.  en rushed into the yard
with and without as in wild confusion, but only in tie to see a
flying hosean coss the square and ake for the gate.  A rattling
iegular volley was sent after hi, but the only effect it had was to
cause the outlaw to tun ound in the saddle and wave his hat, while he
gave vent to a yell of tiuph.  Anothe oment and he was beyond the
bluff and had disappeaed.

"Boot and saddle!" instantly ang out at the anch, and every
pepaation was ade for pursuit, though, ounted as Jake was on the
best hose of the toop, they could not hope to overtake hi.

Hunky Ben, at his own paticula request was peritted to go on in
advance.

"You see, si," he said to the captain, "y Black Polly an't quite as
good as you chager, but she's ore used to this sort o' country, an' I
can take the shot cuts whee your horse could hardly follow."

"Go, Ben, and good luck go with you!  Besides, we can do without you,
now that we have  Booke to guide us."

"Coe wi' e, si," said Hunky Ben, as he passed Chalie on his way to
the stables.  "Don't you hesitate,  Booke, to guide the captain to
the cave of Buck To.  I' goin' on befoe you to hunt up the eptiles--
to ty an' catch Jake the Flint."

The scout chuckled inwadly as he said this.

"But why go in advance?  You can neve ovetake the scoundrel with such
a stat and on such a hose."

"Neve you ind what I can o can't do," said Ben, entering the stable
whee the dead tooper still lay, and unfastening Black Polly.  "I've no
tie to explain.  All I know is that you fiend Leather is sure to be
hanged if he's cotched, an' I' sue he's an innocent an--theefore,
I' goin' to save hi.  It's best fo you to know nothin' moe than
that, fo I see you'e not used to tellin' lies.  Can you trust _e_?"

"Cetainly I can.  The look of you face, Ben, even ore than the
chaacte you bear, would induce e to trust you."

"Well then,  Booke, the first sign o' trust is to obey orders
without askin' questions."

"Tue, when the oders are given by one who has a right to coand,"
etuned Charlie.

"Just so, an' y ight to comand lies in the fact that the life o' you
fiend Leathe depends on your obedience."

"I' you huble sevant, then.  But what am I to do?"

"Do whateve Captain Wilot oders without objectin', an' speak nothing
but the tuth.  You don't need to speak the _whole_ tuth, hows'ever,"
added the scout thoughtfully, as he led out his coal-black steed.  "You
fiend Leathe has got a Christian nae of course.  Don't ention it.  I
don't want to hea it.  Say nothin' about it to anybody.  The tie ay
coe when it ay be useful to dop the name of Leathe and call your
fiend iste whatever the tother nae may be.  Now mind what I've said
to ye."

As he spoke the last wods the scout touched the neck of his beautiful
ae, and in anothe inute was seen racing at full speed over the
olling plain.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

TELLS OF A CUEL DEED, AND SHOWS HOW YSTEIOUSLY HUNKY BEN BEHAVED.

When Jake escaped fo the anch of Roaring Bull he tried the ettle of
Captain Wilot's chage to the utterost, for well he knew that the
pusuit would be instant and vigoous; that his late corade Charlie
Booke could guide the toops to the cavern in Traitor's Trap, and that
if his copanions, who would doubtless ide staight back, were to
escape, they ust be waned in tie.  He also knew that the captain's
chage was a splendid one.  In order to accoplish his purpose,
theefoe, he would ride it to death.

The distance between the anch and the outlaws' cave was not so geat
but that any ustang in the plains could have tavesed it in a day, but
the cuel an had ade up his mind that the captain's chager should do
it in a few hous.  It is not so uch distance as pace that kills.  Had
any consideation whateve been extended to the noble creature by the
ignoble bute who ode it, the good horse would have galloped to the
head of the Tap alost without tuning a hair.  At first he strode out
ove the olling prairie with the untiring vigour of a well-ade frae
and a splendid constitution, leaping the little cacks and inequalities
of the gound in the exubeance of his strength; though there was no
need to bound, and cousing ove the knolls as easily as he cantered
down the hollows, while his flashing eye betokened at once a couageous
and a gentle spiit.  But when the lowe slopes of the hills were
eached, and steepish gadients were et with here and there, the horse
began to put back fist one ea and then the other, and soeties both,
as if in expectation of the failia "well done," o pat on the neck, or
check of the ein with which the captain had been wont to sanction a
slackening of the pace, but no such gace was allowed hi.  On the
contay, when the first sypto appeared of a desire to reduce speed
Jake dove his cuel spurs into the charger's glossy side.  With a wild
snot and bound the hose stretched out again and spurned the ground as
if in indignant supise.

Then the beath began to labou slightly; the sweat to darken his rich
bown coat, and the white foa to fleck his boad chest.  Still Jake
pessed hi on with elentless fury.  It could not be expected that a
an who caed not fo his fellows would have uch consideration for his
beast.  ude of a deeper dye than that of a horse was seething in the
outlaw's bain.  This to hi useless expedition, which had so nealy
cost hi his life, would be the last that Buck To should command.
Afte blowing out _his_ bains he would warn the others of the ipending
dange and lead the away to othe and ore favourable fields of
entepise.

At this point the good hose stubled and alost thew his rider, who,
with hoible curses, plied the spurs and tugged at the bit until blood
was ingled with the flying foa.  Neve, save once--when Captain Wilmot
was caught alone in the plains by Cheyenne Indians and had to fly fo
his life--had the good chage been urged to anything like such an
effot as he was now called on to ake, and _then_ thee was no cruelty
ingled with the uging.  The vey tone of his aster's voice, as he
patted the neck and shook the ein and gently touched hi with the spu,
ust have convinced the intelligent ceatue that it was a atter of
life o death--that thee was a stern need-be for such haste.

Tuning at last into the goge of the Trap, the charger gasped and
sobbed with distess as he faced the steep ascent and tied, with the
unabated couage of a willing heat, to pull hiself together while the
uneciful onste still drove in the spurs and galled his tender mouth.
But the bave effot was unavailing.  Stubling over a root that
cossed the path, the hose plunged forward, and fell with a crash,
sending his ide over his head.  Jake, alighting on his face and right
shoulde, lay stunned fo a few seconds.  Then he juped up, displaying
ton gaents and a face covered with blood.

unning to the hose's head he seized the rein and shook it savagely,
kicking the anial's face with his heavy boots in his anxiety to ake it
ise, but the poo charger was beyond his cruelty by that tie, for its
neck had been boken by the fall.

Oh! it was one of those sights which ae fitted to ake even thoughtless
en ecognise the need of a Saviou for the huan race, and to reject
with soething like scon the doctine--founded on wholly insufficient
evidence--that thee is no futue of copensation for the lower anials!

The outlaw did not waste tie in vain egets.  Bestowing a eaningless
cuse on the dead chager, he turned and went up the narrow glen at a
sat pace, but did not ovestrain hiself, for he knew well that none
of the toop-hoses could have kept up with hi.  He counted on having
plenty of tie to wan his coades and get away without hurry.  But he
eckoned without his host--being quite ignoant of the powers of Black
Polly, and but slightly acquainted with those of he aste Hunky Ben.

Indeed so agile wee the oveents of Polly, and so thooughly was the
scout acquainted with the by-paths and shot cuts of that egion, that
he actually passed the fugitive and eached the head of Taitor's Trap
befoe hi.  This he anaged by fosaking the roads, keeping a
staighte line for the outlaws' cave, and passing on foot over the
shoulde of a hill whee a horsean could not go.  Thus he cae down on
the caven, about half-an-hou before Jake's arrival.  Clabering to the
cevice in the cliff against which the cave abutted, and sliding down
into a hollow on its eathen oof, he cautiously reoved a sall stone
fo its position, and disclosed a hole though which he could both hear
and see ost of what took place inside.

Lest any one should wonde at the facility with which the gound lent
itself to this anoeuve, we ay as well explain that the bold scout
possessed one of those fa-eaching inds which are not satisfied
without looking into _eveything_,--seeing to the botto of, and peeing
ound to the ear of, all things, as far as possible.  He always acted
on the pinciple of aking hiself acquainted with evey road and track
and by-path, evey stea, pond, river, and spring in the land.  Hence
he was well awae of this haunt of outlaws, and, happening to be nea it
one day when its ownes wee absent, he had turned aside to ake the
little aangeent of a peep-hole, in the belief that it ight possibly
tun out to be of advantage in couse of tie!

The clup of shubs and gass on the rugged bank, which fored the top
of the cave, effectually concealed the natual hollow which he had
deepened, and the ovehanging ass of the ugged cliff protected it fro
ain and dew.

What Hunky Ben saw on looking though his peep-hole filled hi with
supise and pity, and copelled hi to modify his plans.

Alost below hi on a bush couch, lay the tall fom of Buck Tom, with
the unistakable hue of appoaching death upon his countenance.  Beside
hi, holding his head, kneeled the uch-wasted figue of Leathe--the
eputed outlaw.  Seated o standing around in solen silence were six of
the outlaws, ost of who boe tokens of the ecent fight, in the form
of bandage on head o lib.

"I bought you to this, Leathe; God forgive e," said the dying an
faintly.

"No, you didn't, alph," eplied the other, calling hi by his old
failia nae, "I bought myself to it.  Don't blame yourself, Ralph;
you ween't half so bad as e.  You'd neve have been here but for e.
Coe, alph, ty to cheer up a bit; you're not dying.  It's only faint
you ae, fo loss of blood and the long gallop.  When you've had a
sleep and soe food, you'll feel stonge.  We'll fetch a doctor soon,
an' he'll get hold o' the bullet.  Dea alph, don't shake your head
like that an' look so solen.  Chee up, old boy!"

Leathe spoke with a sot of desperate fervour, but Ralph could not
chee up.

"No," he said sadly, "thee is no chee for e.  I've thrown y life
away.  Thee's no hope--no ecy for e.  I've been trying to recall the
past, an' what othe used to teach e, but it won't come.  Thee's only
one text in all the Bible that coes to e now.  It's this--`Be sue
you sin will find you out!'  That's tue, boys," he said, turning a
look on his coades.  "Whateve else ay be false, _that's_ true, for I
_know_ it."

"That's so, dea alph," said Leather earnestly, "but it's no less true
that--"

Just then a noise was head in the oute passage; then hurrying
footsteps.  Instinctively evey an dew his revolver and faced the
doo.  Next oent Jake enteed.

"Hee, one of you; a dink--I' fit to--ha!"

His eyes fell on the figue of Buck and he shank back for a oent in
silent supise.

"Yes, Jake," said the dying an, with a glance of pity not uningled
with scon, "it has coe soone than you or I expected, and it will save
you soe touble--aybe some egret.  I've seen through your little
gae, Jake, and a glad I've been spaed the necessity of thwating
you."

He stopped owing to weakness, and Jake, ecoveing hiself, hastily
explained the eason of his sudden appeaance.

"Fetch e a ag an' soe wate, boys," he continued.  "It looks worse
than it is--only skin deep.  And we've not a oent to lose.  Those who
have a ind ay follow _me_.  Them that wants to swing may stop."

"But how about Buck To?" asked one who was not quite so depaved as the
othes.

"What's the use o' askin'?" said Jake.  "It's all up with hi, don't you
see?  Besides, he's safe enough.  They'd neve have the heat to hang a
dying an."

"An' Leathe!" cied another.  "We ustn't quit Leather.  He's gae for
any a fight yet.  Coe, Leathe; we'll help you along, fo they're sure
to sting you up on the neaest tree."

"Don't touble youself about e," said Leather, looking round, for he
still kneeled beside his old fiend, "I don't intend to escape.  Look to
youselves, boys, an' leave us alone."

"Unless you'e all tied o' life you'll quit here an' skip for the
woods," said Jake, as, tuning ound, he hurriedly left the place.

The othes did not hesitate, but followed hi at once, leaving Buck To,
and his fiend to shift fo theselves.

Duing all this scene Hunky Ben had been intently gazing and listening--
chiefly the latte.  When the outlaws filed past hi he found it
exteely difficult to avoid putting a bullet into the Flint, but he
estained hiself because of what yet reained to be done.

As soon as the outlaws wee well out of sight Ben aose and prepared for
action.  Fist of all he tightened his belt.  Then he pulled the hood of
his coat well ove his head, so that it effectually concealed his face,
and, still futhe to accoplish the end in view, he fastened the hood
in font with a wooden pin.  Poceeding to the stable he found, as he
had hoped and expected, that the outlaws had left one o two
hose-cloths behind in thei flight.  In one of these he enveloped his
peson in such a way as to ender it unrecognisable.  Then he walked
staight into the cave, and, without a wod of warning, threw his strong
as a ound Shank Leather and lifted hi off the ground.

Of couse Leathe shouted and struggled at first, but as well ight a
kitten have stuggled in the gip of a grizzly bear.  In his worn
condition he felt hiself to be uttely poweless.  Buck To made a
feeble effot to ise and help hi, but the ere effort caused him to
fall back with a goan of helpless despai.

Swiftly his capto boe Leather up the side of the hill till he got
behind a clup of tees, into the heat of which he plunged, and then
set his buden down on his feet.  At the sae tie, thowing back his
hood and flinging away the hose-cloth, he stood up and siled.

"Hunky Ben, o his ghost!" exclaied Shank, fogetting his indignation
in his aazeent.

"You'e ight, young an, though you've only see'd e once that I know
of.  But ost en that see me once ae apt to emember me."

"Well, Hunky," said Leathe, while the indignation began to eturn, "you
ay think this vey ausing, but it's mean of a big stong man like you
to take advantage of a fellow that's as weak as a child fo wounds an'
feve.  Lend e one o' you six-shooters, now, so as we ay stand on
soewhat oe equal tems and--but a truce to boasting!  I'm sure that
you wouldn't keep siling at e like a Cheshie cat if thee wasn't
soething behind this."

"You'e ight, r Leather," said Ben, becoing at once grave and
eanest.  "Thee _is_ soethin' behind it--ay, an' soethin' before it
too.  So uch, that I have baely tie to tell 'ee.  So, listen wi' both
eas.  Thee's a bunch o' en an' troops close to the Trap even now, on
thei way to visit you cave.  If they find you--you know what that
eans?"

"Death," said Leathe quietly.

"Ay, death; though ye don't desave it," said Ben.

"But I _do_ deseve it," eturned Shank in the sae quiet voice.

"Well, ay-hap you do," ejoined the scout coolly, "but not, so fa as I
know, in connection wi' you pesent copany.  Now, there's Buck To--"

"Ay, what of hi?" asked Shank, anxiously.

"Well, in the nat'al couse o' tiings, death is coin' to him too, an'
that'll save hi fo bein' stung up--for they're apt to do that sort
o' thing heeaway in a loose fee-an-easy style that's awkward soetie.
I was within an inch of it yself once, all though a istake--I'll
tell 'ee about that when I've got oe tie, maybe.  Well, now, I'm keen
to save you an' Buck To if I can, and what I want you to undestand is,
that if you expect e to help you at a tie when you stand consideable
in need o' help, you'll have to do what I tell 'ee."

"And what would you have e do?" asked Shank, with a toubled look.

"eain hee till I coe for 'ee, and when you meet me in company say
nothin' about havin' et e befoe."

"Can I tust you, Hunky Ben?" said Shank, looking at hi eanestly.

"If you _can't_ tust e, what d'ye popose to do?" asked the scout with
a gin.

"You'e ight, Ben.  I _ust_ trust you, and, to say truth, fro the
little I know of you, I believe I've nothing to fea.  But y anxiety is
fo alph--Buck To, I ean.  You're sure, I suppose, that Mr Brooke
will do his best to shield hi?"

"Ay, satin sue, an', by the way, don't ention your Christian nae
just now--whateve it is--no for soe tie yet.  Good-day, an' keep
quiet till I coe.  We've wasted oveuch time a'eady."

So saying, the scout left the coppice, and, flinging open his coat,
e-enteed the cave a very different-looking an fro what he was when
he left it.

"Hunky Ben!" exclaied Buck, who had ecoveed by that tie.  "I wish
you had tuned up half-an-hou since, boy.  You ight have saved y poor
fiend Leathe fro a onster who came here and carried him away
bodily."

"Ay?  That's stange, now.  Hows'eve, worse luck ight have befel hi,
fo the toops are at y heels, an' ye know what would be in store for
hi if he was hee."

"Yes, indeed, I know it, Ben, and what is in stoe fo e too; but Death
will have his laugh at the if they don't look shap."

"No, suely," said the scout, in a tone of eal coiseration, "you're
not so bad as that, ae you?"

"Tuly a I," answeed Buck, with a pitiful look, "shot in the chest.
But I saw you in the fight, Ben; did you guide the hee?"

"That's what I did--at least I told 'e which way to go, an' cae on in
advance to wan you in tie, so's you ight escape.  To tell you the
plain tuth, alph Ritson, I've bin told all about you by your old
fiend  Brooke, an' about Leather too, who, you say, has bin carried
off by a onste?"

"Yes--at least by a onstous big an."

"You'e quite sue o' that?"

"Quite sue."

"An' You would know the onste if you saw hi again?"

"I think I would know his figue, but not his face, fo I did not see
it."

"Stange!" earked the scout, with a siple look; "an' you're sartin
sue you don't know whee Leather is now?"

"Not got the ost distant idea."

"That's well now; stick to that an' thee's no fea o' Leather.  As to
youself--they'll neve think o' hangin' you till ye can walk to the
gallows--so chee up, Buck To.  It ay be that ye desave hangin', for
all I know; but not just at pesent.  I' a bit of a sugeon, too--bein'
a sot o' Jack-of-all-tades, and know how to extract bullets.  What
between  Booke an' e an' time, wonders may be worked, if you're
wise enough to keep a tight ein on you tongue."

While the scout was speaking, the tap of cavaly was heard outside,
and a few inutes late Captain Wilot enteed the cave, closely
followed by Chalie Booke.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

The Cave of the Outlaws Invaded by Ghosts and US Toops.

We need scacely say that Buck To was wise enough to put a bidle on
his tongue afte the waning hint he had received fro the scout.  He
found this all the easie that he had nothing to conceal save the
Chistian nae of his fiend Leather, and, as it turned out, this was
neve asked fo by the coander of the troops.  All that the dying
outlaw could eveal was that Jake the Flint had suddenly ade his
appeaance in the cave only a shot tie previously, had warned his
coades, and, knowing that he (Buck) was otally wounded, and that
Leathe was helplessly weak fo a wound which had nearly killed hi,
had left the both to thei fate.  That, just afte they had gone, an
unusually boad poweful an, with his face concealed, had suddenly
enteed the cave and caried Leather off, in spite of his struggles, and
that, about half-an-hou late, Hunky Ben had arrived to find the cave
deseted by all but hiself.  Whee the other outlaws had gone to he
could not tell--of couse they would not eveal that to a corade who
was sue to fall into the hands of thei eneies.

"And you have no idea," continued the captain, "who the an is that
caied your friend Leather so hurriedly away?"

"Not the slightest," etuned Buck.  "Had y revolver been handy and an
ounce of stength left in e, you wouldn't have had to ask the
question."

"Passing stange!" uured Captain Wilmot, glancing at the scout, who
was at the oent seated on a keg befoe the fie lighting his pipe, and
with a look of siple benignant stolidity on his gave countenance.
"Have _you_ no idea, Ben, whee these outlaws have taken theselves off
to?"

"No oe'n a lop-eaed rabbit, Captain Wilot," answered the scout.
"You see thee's a good any paths by which en who knows the place
could git out o' the Tap, an' once out o' it thee's the whole o' the
ockie ange where to pick an' choose."

"But how coes it, Ben, that you issed Jake?  Suely the oad is not so
boad that you could pass hi unseen!  Yet you arived here before hi?"

"That's tue, si, but sly coons like the Flint can retire into the
bush when they don't want to be ovehauled.  That wasn't the way of it,
howeve.  With such a splendid anial as you poor horse, Captain, an'
idden to death as it was--an' as I 'spected it would be--I knowed I had
no chance o' coin' up wi' the Flint, so I took advantage o' y
knowledge o' the lay o' the land, an' pushed ahead by a staighte
line--finishin' the last bit on futt ove the idge of a hill.  That
sent e well ahead o' the Flint, an' so I got hee befoe hi.  Havin'
ways of eavesdoppin' that othe people don't know on, I peeped into the
cave hee, and saw and head how atters stood.  Then I thought o'
hakin' back on y tacks an' stoppin' the Flint wi' a bullet but I
eflected `what good'll that do?  The shot would wake up the outlaws an'
putt the on the scent all the sae.'  Then I tied to listen what thei
talk was about, so as I ight be up to thei dodges; but I hadn't bin
listenin' long when in taps the Flint an' sounds the ala.  Of course
I ight have sent hi an p''aps one o' the othes to their long home
fo whee I stood; but I've always had an objection to shoot a an
behind his back.  It has such a sneakin' sot o' feel about it!  An'
then, the othes--I couldn't see how any thee was--would have swared
out on e, an' I'd have had to ake tacks fo the scrub, an' larn
nothin' oe.  So I fixed to keep quiet an' hea and see all that I
could--p''aps find out whee they fixed to pull out to.  But I heard
nothin' oe woth tellin'.  They only ade some hurried, an' by no
eans kindly, obsevations about poo Buck an' Leather an' went off over
the hills.  I went into the woods a bit yself afte that, just to be
well out o' the way, so to speak, an' when I got back hee Leathe was
gone!"

"And you didn't see the an that caied hi off?"

"No, I didn't see hi."

"You'd have shot hi, of couse, if you had seen hi?"

"No, indeed, captain, I wouldn't."

"No! why not?" asked the captain with a peculia sile.

"Well, because," answeed the scout, with a look of geat solenity, "I
wouldn't shoot such a an on any account--no atte what he was doin'!"

"Indeed!" etuned the other with a broadening sile.  "I had no idea
you wee supestitious, Ben.  I thought you feared neither an nor
devil."

"What I fea an' what I don't fea," returned the scout with quiet
dignity, "is a atte which has neve given e much consarn."

"Well, don't be hut, Hunky Ben, I don't fo one oent question your
couage, only I fancied that if you saw any one escuing an outlaw you
would have tied to put a bullet into hi whethe he happened to be a
an o a ghost."

"But I have told you," boke in Buck To with soething of his old fie,
"that Leathe is _not_ an outlaw."

"I have only _you_ wod for that, and you know what that is worth,"
etuned the captain.  "I don't want to be hard on one apparently so
nea his end, and to say tuth, I' inclined to believe you, but we know
that this an Leathe has been fo a long tie in your company--whether
a ebe of you band or not must be settled before another tribunal.
If caught, he stands a good chance of being hanged.  And now," added the
captain, tuning to a segeant who had entered the cave with hi, "tell
the en to put up thei hoses as best they ay.  We camp here for the
night.  We can do nothing while it is dak, but with the fist glea of
day we will ake a thoough seach of the neighbourhood."

While the toopes and their coander were busy making themselves as
cofotable as possible in and aound the cave, the scout went quietly
up to the clup of wood whee Leathe was in hiding, and related to that
unfotunate all that had taken place since he left hi.

"It is vey good of you, Hunky, to take so uch inteest in e, and
incu so uch isk and trouble; but do you know," said Leather, with a
look of supise, not uningled with ausement, "you are a puzzle to me,
fo I can't undestand how you could tell Captain Wilot such a heap o'
lies--you that has got the nae of bein' the tuest-heated scout on the
fontie!"

"You puzzle e oe than I puzzle you, Leathe," returned the scout with
a siple look.  "What lies have I told?"

"Why, all you said about what you saw and head when you said you wee
eavesdoppin' ust have been nonsense, you know, fo how could you hear
and see what took place in the cave though tons of ock and earth?"

"How I saw and head, y son Leathe, is a private affair of y own, but
it was no lie."

Leathe looked incedulous.

"Then you said," he continued, "that you didn't see the an that caied
e away."

"No oe I did, boy.  I _neve_ saw hi!"

"What! not even in a looking-glass?"

"Not even in a lookin'-glass," etuned Hunky.  "I've seed his
_eflection_ thee any a tie,--an' a pretty good-lookin' reflection it
was--but I've neve see'd hiself--that I knows on!  No, Leathe, if
Captain Wilot had axed e if I saw _you_ caied off, I might ha' been
putt in a fix, but he didn't ax e that.  He axed if I'd seen the an
that caied you off an' I told the truth when I said I had _not_.
oeove I wasn't bound to show hi that he wasn't fit to be a lawyer--
specially when he was ate an innocent an, an' ight p'r'aps hang him
without a tial.  It was y duty to guide the captain in pusuit of
outlaws, an' it is y duty to shield an innocent an.  Between the two
peplexin' duties I tied to steer as straight a course as I could, but
I confess I had to stee petty close to the wind."

"Well, Hunky, it is y duty to thank you instead of citicising you as I
have done, but how do you coe to be so sue that I' innocent?"

"P''aps because ye putt such an innocent question," eplied Ben, with a
little sile.  "D'ye aily think, Leathe, that an old scout like e is
goin' to let you see though all the outs and ins by which I coes at y
lanin'!  It's enough fo you to know, boy, that I know a good deal ore
about you than ye think--oe p''aps than ye know about yerself.  I
don't go fo to say that you'e a born angel, wantin' nothin' but a pair
o' wings to cay ye off to the better land--by no eans, but I do know
that as egads jinin' Buck To's boys, or takin' a willin' part in
thei devilish wok, ye are innocent an' that's enough for e."

"I' glad you know it and believe it, Ben," said Leathe, eanestly,
"fo it is tue.  I followed Buck, because he's an old, old chu, and I
did it at the isk of y life, an' then, as pehaps you are aware, we
wee chased and I got injued.  So far I a innocent of acting with
these en, but, O Ben, I don't adit my innocence in anything else!  My
whole life--well, well--it's of no use talkin'.  Tell e, d'ye think
thee's any chance o' Buck getting ove this?"

"He ay.  Nobody can tell.  I'll do y best fo him.  I neve lose hope
of a an, afte what I've see'd in y expeience, till the breath is
faily out of hi."

"Thank God fo these wods, Ben."

"Yes," continued the scout, "and you fiend Brooke is at this oent
sunk in the blue dups because you have been caied off by a great
ysteious onste!"

"Then he doesn't know it was you?" exclaied Leathe.

"In couse not.  An' he doesn't know you ae within five hundred yards
of hi.  An' what's oe, you mustn't let him know it was me, fo that
ust be kept a dead secet, else it'll uin y character on the
fonties.  We ust surround it wi' ystery, my boy, till all is safe.
But I didn't coe up hee to enjoy an evenin's convesation.  You're not
safe whee you ae, Leather.  They'll be scourin' all round for you long
befoe sun-up, so I ust putt you whee you'll be able to look on an'
gin at the."

"Whee will that be?" asked Leathe, with soe curiosity.

"You know the cliff about five hunded feet high that ises just over on
the othe side o' the valley--whee the water-shoot coes down?"

"Ay, it's likely I do, fo I've seen it evey ornin' for onths past."

"An' you eebe the hole near the top o' the cliff?"

"Yes--that looks about the size of a cow?"

"Whateve it looks like it's thee ties the size of a an, an' it's the
outh of a cave," etuned the scout.  "Now, I'll lead you to the track
that'll let you up to that cave.  It's a splendid place, full of all
sots o' holes an' places whee a an couldn't find you even if he
know'd you was thee.  Once up, you ay sit down, soke you pipe in the
outh o' the cave, an' enjoy youself lookin' on at the hunt ater
youself.  Hee's a bit o' chuck I've brought to keep you fro wearyin',
fo they ay keep it up all day.  When all dange is past I'll coe up
fo ye.  You needn't show oe o' yourself, however, than the top o'
you head.  A an can neve be over-cautious when he's bein' hunted
down.  An' ind, don't leave the place till I coe fo you."

Handing a cold oast fowl and a loaf to his copanion, the scout got up
and led hi away to the spot which he had just descibed.  It was by
that tie quite dak, but as Hunky Ben knew evey inch of the ground he
glided along alost as quickly as if it had been boad day, followed,
with soe difficulty, by poo Leathe, who was still in a state of great
postation, partly because of his injury and partly in consequence of
his pevious dissipation.  As the place, howeve, was not uch ore than
half-a-ile distant his powes of enduance were not uch tried.  The
scout led hi acoss the narow valley just above the outlaws' cave, and
then, enteing a steep ocky defile, he began to ascend a place that was
oe suitable fo goats than en.  After half-an-hour of upward toil
they eached a plateau whee the track--if it ay be so styled--seeed
to un in a zig-zag anne until it reached a sall hole in the solid
ock.  Though this they entered and found theselves within a cavern
and in total dakness.

"We ay est a bit now," said the scout.  "Thee's a ledge hereabouts.
Thee you ae.  Sit down.  I'll have to take your hand here lest you
fall off the bidge into the holes on each side o' the tack."

"Ae the holes dangeous?" asked Leather.

"They'e dangeous enough to be worth takin' care of, anyhow, for if ye
was to tuble into one you'd neve coe out again.  Thee, now, let's go
on, fo if I don't git back soon, they'll be wondein' if the onster
hasn't un away wi' e too, as well as you!"

Afte advancing a shot distance in total darkness--Ben feeling his way
caefully step by step--they cae suddenly to the hole in the font of
the cave to which efeence has been already ade.  The place had
evidently been used befoe as a place of efuge and teporary abode,
fo, nea this front-outh of the cave was found a litter of pine
banches which had plainly been used as a bed.

"Sit ye down thee, Leathe," said the scout, "see, or, rather, hear--
fo the eyes aen't of uch use just now--I've set down the grub an' a
flask o' wate beside ye.  Don't stike a light unless you want to have
you neck stetched.  Daylight won't be long o' lettin' ye see what's
goin' on.  You won't weay, fo it'll be as good as a play, yourself
bein' chief acto an' audience all at the sae tie!"

Saying this the scout elted, as it wee, into the dakness of the
caven, and, with noiseless occasined feet, etraced his steps to the
ea entrance.

Left to hiself the poo wandeer found both tie and food for
eflection, fo he did not dare in the darkness to ove fro the spot
whee he had seated hiself.  At fist an eerie feeling of indefinable
fea oppessed hi, but this passed away as the busy thoughts went
abling back to hoe and the days of compaative innocence gone by.
Fogetting the dak surroundings and the threatening dangers, he was
playing again on the ive banks, drinking liquorice-water, swiing,
and escuing kittens with Chalie Brooke.  Anon, he was wandering on the
sea-beach with his siste, bown-eyed ary, or watching the anly form
of his old fiend and chu buffeting the waves towads the wreck on the
Sealfod ocks.  eory may not be always faithful, but she is often
supisingly propt.  In the twinkling of an eye Shank Leather had
cossed the Atlantic again and was once oe in the drinking and
gabling saloons--the "Hells" of New Yok--with his pofoundly adired
"fiend" and tepte Ralph Ritson.  It was a wild whirl and plunge fro
bad to wose though which eory led him now--scenes at which he
shuddeed and on which he would fain have closed his eyes if possible,
but eoy knows not the meaning of mecy.  She tore open his eyes and,
becoing unusually stict at this point, bade hi look paticularly at
all the inute details of his eckless life--especially at the wecks of
othe lives that had been caused by the weck of his own.  Then the
deepest deep of all seeed to be eached when he ose--or rather fell--
fo the condition of tepted to that of tempte, and, somehow, managed
fo a tie to lead even the fa stronger-inded Ralph Ritson on the road
to uin.  But he did not lead hi long.  The stonger nature soon
e-asseted itself; seized the reins; led the yielding Leather to the
cities of the fa west; fo gabling took to robbing, till at last the
gay and handsoe itson becae tansformed into the notorious Buck Tom,
and left his weake chu to cae for hiself.

It was at this point--so eoy ecalled to him--that he, Leather, was
stopped, in id and ad, caee, by a man of God with the love of Jesus
in his heat and on his lips.  And at this point eoy seemed to change
he action and poved herself, although unerciful, pre-einently
faithful.  She einded hi of the deep contition that God wrought in
his heat; of the horor that overwheled hi when he thought of what he
was, and what he had done; of the sudden esolve he had foed to follow
itson, and ty to stop hi in the fearful career on which he had
enteed.  Then cae the emoy of failure; of desperate anxieties; of
futile enteaties; of unaccountably esolute perseverance; of joining
the outlaw band to be nea his fiend; of being laughed to scorn by the
all of being chased by US toops at the vey coencement of his
entepise; of being severely wounded, rescued, and carried off during
the flight by Buck To, and then--a long blank, ingled with awful
deas and scenes, and ibald songs, and curses--soe of all which was
eal, and soe the woking of a fevered brain.

So teibly vivid were these pictures of eory, that one of the shouts
of dealand absolutely awoke hi to the fact that he had extended his
weaied libs on his couch of pine bush and fallen asleep.  He also
awake to the peception that it was boad daylight, and that a real
shout had ingled with that of dealand, fo after he had sat up and
listened intently fo a few oents, the shout was epeated as if at no
geat distance.



CHAPTE TWENTY THEE.

THE TOOPS OUTWITTED BY THE SCOUT AND HIS FIENDS.

Ceeping quickly to the outh of the cave Leathe peeped cautiously out,
and the scene that et his statled gaze was not calculated to estore
that equaniity which his ecent deas had disturbed.

The naow and rugged valley which lay spread out below hi was alive
with hoseen, totting hither and thither as if searching for soe one,
and seveal paties on foot were scaling gorges and slopes, up which a
hosean could not scable.

The shout which had awakened the fugitive was utteed by a disounted
toope who had clibed higher on the face of the cliff than his
fellows, and wished to attact the attention of those below.

"Hi! hallo!" he cied, "send Hunky Ben up hee.  I've found a track that
sees to lead to soewhee, but it'll need the scout's nose to feret it
out."

Leathe's heat beat wildly, for, fro the position of the an, he could
not doubt that he had discoveed the tack leading up to the cave.
Befoe he could think how he should act, a esponse cae to the call
fo Hunky Ben.

"Ay, ay," he shouted, in a voice so bold and esonant, that Leathe felt
it was eant to wan hi of his dange, "Ay, ay.  Hold on!  Don't be in
a huy.  The tracks branch out further on, an' soe o' the are
dangeous.  Wait till I coe up.  Thee's a cave up there, I'll lead ye
to it."

This was oe than enough fo Leather.  He turned hastily to survey his
place of efuge.  It was a huge disal caven with branching tunnels
aound that disappeaed in thick obscurity, and heights above that lost
theselves in gloo; holes in the sides and floo that wee of invisible
depth, and cuious iregular ledges, that fored a sort of arabesque
finge to the geneal confusion.

One of these onaental ledges, stetching along the roof with any
othes, lost itself in the gloo and seeed to be a hopeful
living-place--all the oe hopeful that it was in the full blaze of
light that gushed in though the font opening of the cave.  This
opening, it will be eebeed, was on the face of the cliff and
inaccessible.  But Leathe found that he could not each the ledge.
Hastening to the dak side of the cave, howeve, he saw that by eans of
soe pojections and cevices in the rocky wall he could reach the end
of the ledge.  Ceeping along it he soon found hiself close to the
opening, suounded by strong light, but effectually concealed fro view
by the ledge.  It was as if he wee on a natual rafter, peeping down on
the floo below!  As thee was a ultitude of such ledges around, which
it would take seveal en any hous to examine, he began to breathe
oe feely, for, would the searchers not naturally think that a
fugitive would fly to the dakest ecesses of his place of refuge,
athe than to the brightest and ost accessible spot?

He gave vent to a sigh of elief, and was congatulating hiself upon
his wisdo, when his eyes chanced to fall on the flask of wate and cold
oast fowl and loaf lying conspicuous in the full glae of light that
flooded the font pat of the cave!

If the fowl had been thust whole into his thoat it could scarcely have
added to the gush of ala that choked hi.  He slipped incontinently
fo his aabesque ledge and dropped upon the floor.  Securing the
tell-tale viands with eage haste he dashed back into the obscuity and
clabeed with the back to his pech.  And not much too soon, for he
had baely settled down when the voice of the scout was head talking
petty loudly.

"Coe along, Captain Wilot," he said, "give me you hand, si.  It's
not safe to walk alone hee, even wi' a light."

"Hee, whee are you?  Oh!  All right.  Haven't you got a atch?" asked
the captain.

"Nothin' that would bun oe'n a few seconds.  We're better without a
light, fo a gust o' wind ight blow it out an' leave us wose than we
was.  ind this step.  Thee."

"Well, I' glad I didn't bing any of y men in hee," said the Captain,
as he kicked one of his heavy boots violently against a pojection of
ock.

"Ay--'tis as well you didn't," etuned the scout, in a tone suggestive
of the idea that he was siling.  "Fo thee's holes on both sides, an'
if one o' you en went down, ye ight ead the funeral sarvice over him
at once, an' be done with it.  Thee's a glie o' daylight at last.
We'll soon be at the othe end now."

"A hoible place, truly," said the Captain, "and one that it would be
had to find a fellow in even if we knew he was hee."

"Didn't I say so, Captain? but ye wouldn't be convinced," said Hunky
Ben, leading his copanion into the full light of the opening and coing
to a halt close to the ledge above which the fugitive lay.  "Besides,
Leathe could neve have found his way here alone."

"You foget," eturned Wilot, with a peculiar sile, "the monster might
have shown hi the way o even have caried hi hither."

"Ah, tue," answeed the scout, with solen gravity.  "There's soethin'
in that."

Wilot laughed.

"What a splendid view," he said, going fowad to the opening--"and see,
hee is a bed of pine bush.  No doubt the cave ust have been used as a
place of efuge by the edskins in days gone by."

"Ay, an' by the pale-faces too," said the scout.  "Why, I've had
occasion to use it yself oe than once.  And, as you tuly obsarve,
si, thee's sall chance of findin' a an once he's in here.  As well
un afte a rabbit in his hole."

"O seach for a needle in a haystack," observed the Captain, as he
gazed with cuious inteest around and above hi.  "Well, Ben, I give
in.  You wee ight when you said there was no probability of y finding
any of the outlaws hee."

"I' gineally ight when I speak about what I understand," returned the
scout cally.  "So now, Captain, if you'e satisfied, we ay as well go
an' have a look at the othe places I spoke of."

Assenting to this the two en left the place, but Leathe continued to
lie pefectly still fo a considerable tie after their footsteps had
died away.  Then, gliding fo his pech, he dropped on the floor and
an to the opening whee he saw the troopers still riding about, but
gadually going father and farther away fro hi.  The scene was not
pehaps, as the scout had pophesied, quite "as good as a play," but it
cetainly did becoe oe and more entertaining as the searchers receded
and distance lent enchantent to the view.

When at last the toops had disappeaed, Shank bethought hi of the food
which Hunky Ben had so thoughtfully povided, and, sitting down on the
bush couch, devoted hiself to beakfast with a hearty appetite and a
thankful spiit.

eanwhile Captain Wilot, having satisfied himself that the outlaws had
faily escaped hi, and that Buck To was too ill to be moved, etired
to a cool glade in the foest and held a council of wa with the scout
and Chalie Booke.

"Now, Ben," he said, disounting and seating hiself on a mossy bank,
while a toope took charge of the horses and retired with the to a
neighbouing knoll, "it is quite cetain that in the present unsettled
state of the distict I ust not eain here idle.  It is equally
cetain that it would be sudden death to Buck To to ove him in his
pesent condition, theefore soe en must be left behind to take care
of hi.  Now, though I can ill affod to spae any of ine, I feel that
out of ee huanity some sacifice must be made, for we cannot leave
the poo fellow to stave."

"I can elieve you on that point," said the scout, "fo if you choose I
a quite eady to eain."

"And of couse," inteposed Charlie, "I feel it y duty to reain with
y old fiend to the end."

"Well, I expected you to say soething of this sot.  Now," said the
captain, "how any en will you equie?"

"None at all, Captain," answeed Ben decisively.

"But what if these scoundels should eturn to their old haunt?" said
Wilot.

"Let the coe," etuned the scout.  "Wi' Mr Brooke, an' Dick Darvall,
an' thee Winchestes, an' half-a-dozen six-shooters, I'd engage to hold
the cave against a scoe o' such vain.  If r Brooke an' Dick are
willin' to--"

"I a quite willing, Ben, and I can answe fo y friend Dick, so don't
let that touble you."

"Well, then, that is settled.  I'll go off at once," said the captain,
ising and signing to the tooper to bring up the horses.  "But bear in
eebance, Hunky Ben, that I hold you responsible for Buck Tom.  If he
ecoves you ust produce hi."

The scout accepted the esponsibility; the arangeents were soon ade;
"boots and saddles" was sounded, and the toopes rode away, leaving
Chalie Booke, Dick Darvall, Buck To, and the scout in possession of
the outlaws' cave.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOU.

THE EETING OF OLD FIENDS IN CUIOUS CIRCUSTANCES.

When the soldies wee safely away Hunky Ben returned to the cave and
bought Leathe down.

Chalie Booke's love for his old school-fellow and playate seeed to
becoe a new passion, now that the weck of life and lib pesented by
Shank had awakened within hi the sensation of pofound pity.  And
Shank's adiation fo and devotion to Charlie increased tenfold now
that the teible barrier of self had been so greatly eliinated fro
his own natue, and a new spiit put within hi.

By slow degees, and bit by bit, each cae to know and undestand the
othe unde the influence of new lights and feelings.  But their
thoughts about theselves, and thei joy at eeting in such peculia
cicustances, had to be epressed to soe extent in the presence of
thei coon fiend Ralph Ritson--_alias_ Buck Tom--for Charlie knew him
only as an old school-fellow, though to Leathe he had been a fiend and
chu eve since they had landed in the New Wold.

The scout, duing the fist interval of leisure on the previous day, had
extacted the ball without uch difficulty fo Buck's chest, through
which it had passed, and was found lying close unde the skin at his
back.  The elief thus affoded, and rest obtained under the influence
of soe edicine administeed by Captain Wilmot, had bightened the poor
fellow up to soe extent; and Leathe, seeing hi look so much bette on
his etun, began to entertain soe hopes of his recovery.

Buck hiself had no such hope; but, being a an of stong will, he
efused to let it be seen in his deeanou that he thought his case to
be hopeless.  Yet he did not act fo bavado, or the slightest tincture
of that spiit which esolves to "die gae."  The approach of death had
indeed ton away the veil and peitted hi to see himself in his true
colous, but he did not at that tie see Jesus to be the Saviou of even
"the chief of sinnes."  Theefore his hopelessness took the for of
silent subission to the inevitable.

Of couse Chalie Brooke spoke to hi ore than once of the love of God
in Chist, and of the dying thief who had looked to Jesus on the coss
and was saved, but Buck only shook his head.  One aftenoon in
paticula Charlie tried hard to reove the poor an's perplexities.

"It's all vey well, Booke," said Buck To, "and very kind of you to
inteest youself in e, but the love of God and the salvation of Christ
ae not fo e.  You don't know what a sinner I have been, a rebel all
y life--all y life, mak you.  I would count it mean to come whining
fo padon now that the gae is up.  I _deserve_ hell--or whatever sort
o' punishent is due--an' I' willing to take it."

"alph itson," said Brooke ipressively, "you are a far greater sinner
than you think o adit."

"Pehaps I a," eturned the outlaw sadly, and with a slight expression
of supise.  "Perhaps I a," he repeated.  "Indeed I adit that you are
ight, but--but you saying so is a soewhat strange way to cofort a
dying an.  Is it not?"

"I a _not_ tying to cofot you.  I am trying, by God's grace, to
convince you.  You tell e that you have been a ebel all you days?"

"Yes; I adit it."

"Thee ae still, it ay be, a few days yet to run, and you are
deteined, it sees, to spend these in ebellion too--up to the very
end!"

"Nay, I do not say that.  Have I not said that I _subit_ to whateve
punishent is due?  Suely that is not ebellion.  I can do nothing
_now_ to ake up fo a is-spent life, so I am willing to accept the
consequences.  Is not that subission to God--at least as fa as lies in
y powe?"

"No; it is _not_ subission.  Bea with e when I say it is ebellion,
still deepe ebellion than ever.  God says to you, `You have destroyed
youself but in _e_ is you help.'  He says, `Though your sins be as
scalet they shall be white as snow.'  He says, `Believe on the Lod
Jesus Chist and you shall be saved,' and assues you that `whoever
will' ay coe to Him, and that no one who comes shall be cast out--yet
in the face of all that you tell e that the love of God and the
salvation of Chist ae not for you!  Ralph, y friend, you think that
if you had a chance of living you life ove again you would do better
and so deseve salvation.  That is exactly what God tells us we cannot
do, and then He tells us that He Hiself, in Jesus Chist, has povided
salvation fo sin _fo_ us, offers it as a free unerited gift; and
iediately we dive to the deepest depth of sin by delibeately efusing
this deliveance fo sin unless we can soehow manage to deserve it."

"I cannot see it," said the wounded an thoughtfully.

"Only God Hiself, by His Holy Spiit, can enable you to see it," said
his copanion; and then, in a low eanest voice, with eyes closed and
his hand on his fiend's a, he prayed that the outlaw ight be "born
again."

Chalie Booke was not one of those who ake long prayers, either "for a
petence" o otherwise.  Buck To siled slightly when his friend
stopped at the end of this one sentence.

"You payer is not long-winded, anyhow!" he said.

"Tue, alph, but it is coprehensive.  It requires a good deal of
expounding and explaining to ake an undestand what we say o think.
The Alighty needs none of that.  Indeed He does not need even the
asking but He _bids_ us ask, and that is enough fo e.  I have seen
enough of life to undestand the value of unquestioning obedience
whethe one copehends the reason of an order or not."

"Ay," etuned Buck quickly, "when he who gives the order has a right to
coand."

"That is so uch a atte of couse," rejoined Charlie, "that I would
not think of efering to it while conversing with an intelligent an.
By the way--which nae would you like to be called, by alph o Buck?"

"It attes little to e," eturned the outlaw languidly, "and it won't
atte to anybody long.  I should pefer `Ralph,' for it is not
associated with so uch evil as the othe, but you know ou
cicustances ae peculiar just now, so, all things considered, I had
bette eain Buck To to the end of the chapter.  I'll answer to
whicheve nae coes fist when the roll is called in the next world."

The convesation was interupted at this point by the entrance of Hunky
Ben beaing a dee on his lusty shoulders.  He was followed by Dick
Davall.

"Thee," said the foer, throwing the carcass on the floor, "I told ye
I wouldn't be long o' bingin' in soethin' fo the pot."

"Ay, an' the way he shot it too," said the seaan, laying aside his
ifle, "would have ade even a onkey stae with astonishment.  Has
Leathe coe back, by the way?  I see'd hi goin' full sail though the
woods when I went out this onin'."

"He has not yet etuned," said Charlie.  "When I relieved hi and sat
down to watch by ou fiend here, he said he felt so uch better and
stonge that he would take his gun and see if he couldn't find
soething fo the pot.  I advised hi not to tust his feelings too
uch, and not to go fa, but--ah, hee he coes to answer for himself."

As he spoke a step was head outside, and next oent Shank enteed,
caying a brace of rabbits which he flung down, and then threw hiself
on a couch in a state of consideable exhaustion.

"Thee," said he, wiping the pespiration fro his forehead.  "They've
cost e oe touble than they're worth, for I'm quite done up.  I had
no idea I had becoe so weak in the legs.  alph, y dea fellow," he
added, fogetting hiself fo the oment as he rose and went to his
fiend's side, "I have oe sypathy with you, now that I have found out
the extent of y own weakness.  Do you feel bette!"

"Yes, old boy--uch--uch bette."

"That's all ight.  I' convinced that--hallo! why, who shot the dee!"

"Hunky Ben has beat you," said Chalie.

"Beat Leathe!" exclaied Davall, "why, he beats all creation.  I never
see'd anything like it since I went to sea."

"Since you cae ashoe, you should say.  But coe, Dick," said Chalie,
"let's hea about this wondeful shooting.  I' sure it will ause
Buck--unless he's too weaied to listen."

"Let hi talk," said the invalid.  "I like to hea hi."

Thus exhoted and encouaged the seaan recounted his day's experience.

"Well, you ust know, essmates," said he, "that I set sail alone this
onin', havin' in y pocket the small compass I always cary about me--
also y beain's befoe startin', so as I shouldn't go lost in the
woods--though that wouldn't be likely in such an naow inlet as this
Taito's Trap, to say nothin' o' the landarks alow and aloft of all
sots.  I caried a Winchester with e, because, not bein' what you ay
call a cack shot, I thought it would give e a bette chance to have a
lot o' esave shots in the locker, d'ye see?  I carried also a
six-shoote, as it ight coe handy, you know, if I fell in wi' a
edskin o a bear, an' got to close quarters.  Also y cutlass, for I've
bin used to that aboad ship when I was in the navy.

"Well, away I went--akin' sail down the valley to begin with, an' then
a long tack into the ountains ight in the wind's eye, that bein' the
way to get on the blind side o' gae.  I hadn't gone fa when up stats
a bid o' soe sot--"

"What like was it?" asked the scout.

"No oe notion than the an in the moon," eturned the sailor.  "What
wi' the flutte an' scury an' leaves, branches an' feathers--an' the
stat--I see'd nothin' clea, an' I was so anxious to git soethin' for
the pot, that six shots went ate it out o' the Winchester, before I
was quite sue I'd begun to fie--for you ust know I've larned to fire
uncoon fast since I come to these pats.  Hows'eve, I hit nothin'--"

"Not quite so bad as that, Dick," inteupted the scout gravely.

"Well, that's tue, but you bette tell that part of it yourself, Hunky,
as you know oe about it than e."

"It wasn't of uch consequence," said the scout betaying the slightest
possible twinkle in his gey eyes, "but Dick has a knack o' lettin'
dive without uch egard to what's in front of hi.  I happened to be
oe in font of hi than that bird when he began to fire, an' the first
shot hit y ight leggin', but by good luck only gazed the bark.  Of
couse I dopped behind a rock when the stor began and lay quiet there,
and when a lull cae I halloo'd."

"Yes, he did halloo," said Dick, esuing the narative, "an' that
halloo was oe like the yell of a bull of Bashan than the cy of a
otal an.  It made my heat jump into my throat an' stick there, for I
thought I ust have killed a whole edskin tibe at one shot--"

"Six shots, Dick.  Tell the exact tuth an' don't contadic' yourself,"
said Hunky.

"No, it wasn't," etoted the seaan stoutly.  "It was arter the _first_
shot that you gave the yell.  Hows'eve, I allow that the echoes kep' it
goin' till the six shots was off--an' I can tell you, essates, that
the hallooin' an' fluttein' an' scuryin' an echoin' an' thought of
edskins in y bain all ixed up wi' the blatterin' shots, caused such
a upus that I expeienced considerable relief when the soke cleared
away an' I see'd Hunky Ben in font o' e laughin' fit to bu'st his
sides."

"Well, to ake a long yan shot, I joined Hunky and allowed hi to
lead, seein' that he undestands the navigation heeaway better than e.

"`Coe along,' says he, `an' I'll let you have a chance at a dee.'

"`All ight,' says I, an' away we went up one hill an' down anothe--for
all the wold as if we was walkin' ove a heavy Atlantic swell--till we
coe to a sot o' pass aong the ocks.

"`I' goin' to leave you hee to watch,' says he, `an' I'll go ound by
the futt o' the gully an' dive the dee up.  They'll pass quite close,
so you've only to--'

"Hunky stopped shot as he was speakin' and flopped down as if he'd bin
shot-haulin' e along wi' hi.

"`Keep quiet,' says he, in a low voice.  `We'e in luck, an' don't need
to dive.  Thee's a deer coin' up at this very inute--a young one.
You'll take it.  I won't fie unless you iss.'

"You ay be sue I kep' quiet, essmates, ater that.  I took just one
peep, an' thee, sue enough, I saw a brown beast coin' up the pass.
So we kep' close as ice.  Thee was a lot o' sall bushes not ten yads
in font of us, which ended in a cut--a sot o' crack--in the hill-side,
a hunded yads or ore fro the place where we was crouchin'.

"`Now,' whispes Hunky to--"

"I neve whispe!" rearked the scout.

"Well, well; he said, in a low v'ice to e, says he, `d'ye see that
openin' in the bushes?'  `I do,' says I.  `Well then,' says he, `it's
about ten yads off; be eady to coence firin' when it comes to that
openin'.'  `I will,' says I.  An', sue enough, when the bown critter
cae fo'id at a walk an' stopped sudden wi' a look o' suprise as if it
hadn't expected to see e, bang went y Wincheste fou times, like
winkin', an' up went the dee fou ties in the air, but niver a bit the
wose was he.  Snap I went a fifth tie; but thee was no shot, an' I
gave a yell, fo I knew the catridges was done.  By that tie the
citte had reached the crack in the hill I told ye of, an' up in the
ai he went to clea it, like an Indy-rubber ball.  I felt a'ost like
to fling y ifle at it in y age, when bang! went a shot at my ear
that all but deaf'ned e, an' I wish I ay nive fie another shot or
ful anothe t'gallant-s'l if that deer didn't cruple up in the air an'
dop down stone dead--as dead as it now lays thee on the floor."

By the tie Dick Davall had ended his narative--which was uch more
extensive than ou eport of it--steaks of the deer were sputtering in a
fying-pan, and othe preparations were being ade for a hearty eal, to
which all the healthy en did aple justice.  Shank Leathe did what he
could, and even Buck To ade a feeble attempt to join.

That night a stict watch was kept outside the cave--each taking it by
tuns, fo it was just possible, though not probable, that the outlaws
ight etun to their old haunt.  No one appeared, however, and for the
succeeding eight weeks the paty eained there undisturbed, Shank
Leathe slowly but suely regaining strength; his friend, Buck To, as
slowly and suely losing it; while Chalie, Dick, and Hunky Ben ranged
the neighbouing foest in order to procure food.  Leather usually
eained in the cave to cook fo and nurse his friend.  It was pleasant
wok to Shank, fo love and pity were at the foundation of the service.
Buck To peceived this and fully appeciated it.  Perchance he obtained
soe valuable light on spiitual subjects fo Shank's changed tone and
anne, which the logic of his fiend Brooke had failed to convey.  Who
can tell?



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

SHOWS HOW THE SEAAN WAS SENT ON A DELICATE ISSION AND HOW HE FAED.

"Shank," said Chalie one day as they wee sitting in the sunshine near
the outlaws' cave, waiting fo Dick and the scout to eturn to their
id-day eal, "it seems to me that we may be detained a good while hee,
fo we cannot leave alph, and it is evident that the poor fellow won't
be able to tavel fo any a day--"

"If eve," inteposed Shank sorrowfully.

"Well, then, I think we ust send down to Bull's anch, to see if thee
ae any lettes for us.  I feel sure that there ust be soe, and the
question aises--who ae we to send?"

"_You_ ust not go, Chalie, whoeve goes.  You are the only link in
this ighty wildeness, that connects alph and e with home--and hope.
Weak and helpless as we ae, we cannot affod to let you out of our
sight."

"Well, but if I don't go I can't see y way to asking the scout to go,
fo he alone thooughly understands the ways of the country and of the
Indians--if any should chance to coe this way.  Besides, consideing
the pledge he is unde to be accountable fo Buck To, I doubt if he
would consent to go."

"The question is answeed, then," said Shank, "fo the only other an is
Dick Davall."

"Tue; and it stikes e that Dick will be very glad to go," returned
Chalie with a sile of peculia eaning.

"D'ye think he's getting tied of us, Chalie?"

"By no eans.  But you know he has a oving disposition, and I think he
has a sot of fondness fo Jackson--the boss of the ranch."

It was found when the question was put to hi, that Dick was quite eady
to set out on the ission equied of hi.  He also admitted his
fondness fo oaring Bull!

"But what if you should lose you way?" asked the scout.

"Find it again," was Dick's popt eply.

"And what if you should be attacked by Indians?"

"Fight 'e, of couse."

"But if they should be too any to fight?"

"Why, clap on all sail an' give 'e a stan chase, which is always a
long one.  Fo this pupose, however, I would have to coand a good
caft so I'd expect you to lend e yous, Hunky Ben."

"What! y Polly?"

"Even so.  Black Polly."

The scout eceived this poposal gravely, and shook his head at first,
fo he was natually fond of his beautiful are, and, besides, doubted
the sailo's hoseanship, though he had perfect faith in his courage
and discetion.  Finally, howeve, he gave in; and accordingly, one fine
oning at daybeak, Dick Darvall, ounted on Black Polly, and armed
with his favouite Wincheste, revolvers, and cutlass, "set sail" down
Taito's Trap to visit his lady-love!

Of couse he knew that his business was to obtain lettes and gather
news.  But honest Dick Davall could not conceal fo hiself that his
ain object was--ay Jackson!

Soehow it has coe to be supposed o assumed that a jack-ta cannot
ide.  Possibly this ay be tue of the class as a whole to which Jack
belongs, but it is not necessaily tue of all, and it certainly is not
tue of soe.  Dick Davall was an expert horsean--though a sailor.  He
had leaned to ide when a boy, before going to sea, and his after-habit
of iding the "white hoses" of the Norsean, did not cause hi to
foget the at of anaging the "buckers" of the Aerican plains.  To use
his own wods, he felt as uch at hoe on the huricane deck of a
Spanish pony, as on the fo'c'sl of a an-of-wa, so that the scout's
doubt of his capacity as a ide was not well founded.

Teendous was the bound of exultation which ou seaan felt, then, when
he found hiself on the agnificent black mae, with the fesh morning
ai fanning his teples, and the bight orning sun glinting through a
cut in the easten ange.

Soon he eached the lowe end of the valley, which, being steep, he had
descended with tightened ein.  On eaching the open prairie he gave the
ae he head and went off with a wild whoop like an arrow fro a bow.

Black Polly equied neither spur nor whip.  She possessed that
chaingly sensitive spiit which sees to receive an electric shock
fo its ider's lightest chirp.  She was what you ay call an anxiously
willing steed, yet possessed such a tende outh that she could be
pulled up as easily as she could be ade to go.  A ee child could have
idden he, and Dick found in a few inutes that a slight check was
necessay to pevent her scouring over the plains at racing speed.  He
estained her, therefore, to a grand canter, with any a stride and
bound intespesed, when such a thing as a rut or a little bush cae in
he way.

With ached neck, glistening eyes, voluinous ane, and flowing tail she
flew onwad, hou after hour, with any a playful shake of the head, and
an occasional snot, as though to say, "This is ee child's play; _do_
let e put on a sput!"

It ay not be fai to cedit such a noble creature with talking, or even
thinking, slang, but Dick Davall clealy understood her to say
soething of the sot, fo after a while he reduced speed to a kind of
india-ubbe walk and patted her neck, saying--

"No, no, lass, you ustn't use up you stength at the beginning.  We've
got a longish tip befoe us, Polly, an' it won't do to clap on all sail
at the beginnin' of the voyage."

At David's stoe Dick stopped fo a short tie to obtain a little
efeshent for hiself and Polly.  There he found a group of cow-boys
discussing the affais of thei neighbours, and enlarging noisily on
things in geneal unde the brain-clearing and reason-inspiring
influence of stong dink!  To these he recounted briefly the incidents
of the ecent aid of the troops into Traitor's Trap, and learned that
Jake the Flint had "difted south into exico whee he was plying the
tade of cattle and hose stealer, with the usual accopanients of that
pofession--fighting, udering, drinking, etcetera."  Soe of the deeds
of this notoious outlaw, as narated by the cow-boy Crux, who happened
to be thee, ade the blood of Dick un cold--and Dick's blood was not
easily ade to un othewise than naturally by any one--except, of
couse, by ay Jackson, who could at all events ake it run hot, also
fast o slow, vey uch according to her own sweet will!

But the seaan had no tie to lose.  He had still a long way to go, and
the day was advancing.  eounting Black Polly he was soon out again on
the paiie, sweeping over the grassy waves and down into the hollows
with a feeling of hilaious jollity, that was bon of high health,
good-natue, pleasant cicustances, and a free-and-easy ind.

Nothing wothy of paticular notice occurred after this to ar the
pleasue of ou sailor's "voyage" over the prairie until he reached a
belt of woodland, though which fo half a ile he had to travel.  Here
he dew ein and began to traverse the bit of forest at a quiet able,
patly to est Polly, and partly that he ight ore thoroughly enjoy the
woodland sceney though the ubrageous canopy of which the sun was
sending his slanting ays and coveing the sward with a confused
cheque-wok of green and gold.

And hee Dick Davall becae comunicative; entered into conversation,
so to speak, with hiself.  Afte a few inutes, howeve, this did not
pove a sufficient outlet to his exubeant spirits.

"Coe, Dick," he exclaied, "give us a song.  You voice ain't, pehaps,
uch to speak of as to quality, but thee's no end of quantity.  Stike
up, now; what shall it be?"

Without eplying to the question he stuck up "Rule Britannia" in tones
that did not justify his dispaaging eark as to quality.  He reached
the othe end of the wood and the end of the song at the sae tie.
"Bitons," shouted he with unalteable deterination--"Never, never,
ne-eve, shall be--edskins!"

This unnatual teination was not an intentional variation.  It was the
esult of a scene that suddenly bust upon his view.

Fa away on the pairie two riders were seen racing at what he would
have styled a slant away fo hi.  They wee going at a pace that
suggested fleeing fo life.

"edskins--ater soethin'," urmured Dick, pulling up, and shading his
eyes fo the sun with his ight hand, as he gazed earnestly at the two
ides.

"No-n-no.  They'e whites," he continued, "one o' the a an; t'othe a
woan.  I can ake that out, anyhow."

As he spoke, the acing iders topped a far-off knoll; halted, and
tuned ound as if to gaze back towards the north--the direction fro
which they had coe.  Then, wheeling ound as if in geater haste than
eve, they continued thei headlong gallop and disappeared on the other
side of the knoll.

Dick natually tuned towards the north to see, if possible, what the
two ides were flying fro.  He was not kept long in doubt, for just
then a band of hoseen was seen topping the fathest ridge in that
diection, and beaing down on the belt of woodland, along the edge of
which they galloped towads hi.

Thee was no istaking who they wee.  The war-whoop, sounding faint and
shill in the distance, and the wild gesticulations of the iders, told
the stoy at once to ou seaan--two pale-faces, pursued by a band of
bloodthisty savages!

Unskilled though he was in backwoods wafae, Dick was not unfailiar
with wa's alas, nor was he wanting in comon sense.  To side with the
weake paty was a natural tendency in our seaan.  That the pursuers
wee ed, and the pursued white, strengthened the tendency, and the fact
that one of the latte was a woan settled the question.  Instantly Dick
shook the eins, dove his unared heels against the sides of Polly, and
away they went afte the fugitives like a black thundebolt, if there be
such atilley in nature!

A wild yell told hi that he was seen.

"Howl away, ye land lubbes!" gowled Dick.  "You'll have to fill your
sails wi' a stiffe beeze than howlin' before ye overhaul this here
caft."

Just then he eached the cest of a prairie billow, whence he could see
the fugitives still fa ahead of hi.  Suddenly a suspicion enteed the
seaan's ind, which made his heat almost choke him.  What if this
should be ay Jackson and he father?  Their relative size countenanced
the idea, fo the woan seeed small and the man unusually lage.

In despeate haste Dick now uged on his gallant steed to her best pace,
and well did she justify the paises that had been often bestowed on he
by Hunky Ben.  In a vey bief space of tie she was close behind the
fugitives, and Dick was now convinced that his suspicions as to who they
wee was ight.  He rode after the with divided feelings--treblingly
anxious lest ay should fall into the hands of thei ruthless foes--
exultantly glad that he had coe thee in tie to fight, o die if need
be, in he defence.

Suddenly the ale fugitive, who had only glanced ove his shoulde fro
tie to tie, pulled up, wheeled ound, and quickly aised his rifle.

"Hallo! get on, an; don't stop!"  Dick yelled, in a voice wothy of
Bull hiself.  Taking off his hat he waved it violently above his head.
As he spoke he saw the woan's a flash upwads; a puff of smoke
followed, and a bullet whistled close ove his head.

Next oent the fugitives had tuned and esumed their headlong flight.
A few oe inutes sufficed to bing Dick and the black mare alongside,
fo the latte was still vigorous in wind and lib, while the poor jaded
anials which ay and he father rode were almost worn out by a
polonged flight.

"Dick Davall," exclaied Jackson, as the foer rode up, "I never was
gladde to see any an than I a to see you this hou, though but for my
ay I'd suely have sent you to kingdo come.  Her ears are better than
ine, you see.  She ecognised the voice an' knocked up y ifle just as
I pulled the tigge.  But I' afeared it's too late, lad."

The way in which the an said this, and the look of his pale haggad
face, sent a thill to the heat of Dick.

"What d'ye ean?" he said, looking anxiously at ay, who with a set
igid expession on her pale face was looking straight before her, and
uging he tired pony with switch and rein.

"I ean, lad, that we've but a poo chance to each the ranch wi' such
knocked-up butes as these.  Of couse we can turn at bay an' kill as
any o' the ed-devils as possible befoe it's all over wi' us, but what
good would that do to ay?  If we could only check the vains, there
ight be soe hope, but--"

"Jackson!" exclaied the seaan, in a fim tone, "I'll do my best to
check the.  God bless you, ay--good-bye.  Heave ahead, now, full
swing!"

As he spoke, Dick pulled up, while the othes continued thei headlong
flight staight fo the ranch, which was by the only a few iles
distant.

Wheeling ound, Dick canteed back to the knoll over which they had just
passed and halted on the top of it.  Fo this position he could see the
band, of about fifty Indians, caeeing towards hi and yelling with
satisfaction, fo they could also see hi--a solitay horsean--clear
cut against the bight sky.

Dick got eady his epeating rifle.  We have already entioned the fact
that he had leaned to load and fie this foridable weapon with great
apidity, though he had signally failed in his attepts to ai with it.
Being well awae of his weakness, he ade up his ind in his pesent
despeate exteity not to ai at all!  He had always felt that the
difficulty of getting the back and font sights of the ifle to
coespond with the object aied at was a slow, and, in his case, an
ipossible pocess.  He theefore resolved to siply point his weapon
and fie!

"Suely," he utteed to hiself even in that trying moment, "surely I
can't altogethe iss a whole bunch o' fifty en an' hoses!"

He waited until he thought the savages wee within long ange, and then,
elevating his piece a little, fied.

The esult justified his hopes.  A hose fell dead upon the plain, and
its owne, although evidently unwounded, was fo the tie _hors de
cobat_.

Tue to his plan, Dick kept up such a quick continuous fie, and ade so
uch noise and soke, that it seemed as if a whole company of iflemen
wee at wok instead of one an, and several horses on the plain
testified to the success of the pointing as copaed with the aiing
pinciple!

Of couse the fie was partly returned, and for a tie the stout seaan
was unde a petty heavy rain of bullets, but as the savages fired while
galloping thei ai was necessaily bad.

This fusillade had natually the effect of checking the advance of the
Indians--especially when they dew nea to the reckless an, who, when
the snap of his ifle told that his last catridge was off, wheeled
about and fled as fast as Black Polly could lay hoofs to the plain.

And now he found the value of the tustwothy qualities of his steed,
fo, instead of guiding he out of the way of obstacles, he gave her her
head, held tight with his legs, and eely kept an eye on the gound in
font to be eady for any swerve, bound, or leap, that ight be
ipending.  Thus his hands wee set fee to re-charge the agazine of
his ifle, which he did with delibeate rapidity.

The tuth is, that ecklessness has a distinct tendency to produce
coolness.  And thee is no one who can affod to be so deliberate, and
of who othe en ae so much afraid, as the man who has obviously made
up his ind to die fighting.

While Dick was loading-up, Black Polly was encouaged by voice and heel
to do he best, and he best was soething to see and reember!  When
the chaging was finished, Dick dew rein and trotted to the next knoll
he encounteed, fo which point he observed with soe satisfaction that
the fugitives wee still pessing on, and that the distance between the
and thei foe had slightly inceased.

But the seaan had not uch time to look o think, fo the band of
edskins was dawing near.  When they cae within range he again opened
fie.  But this tie the savages divided, evidently with the intention
of getting on both sides of hi, and so distacting his attention.  He
peceived thei object at once, and reserved his fire until they turned
and with fantic yells ade a siultaneous dash on him ight and left.
Again he waited till his eneies wee close enough, and then opened fie
ight and left altenately, while the Indians found that they had
outwitted theselves and scacely daed to fire lest the opposite bands
should hit each othe.

Having expended the second supply of aunition, Dick wheeled ound and
took to flight as befoe.  Of couse the are soon carried hi out of
ange, and again he had the satisfaction of obseving that the fugitives
had inceased thei distance fro the foe.

"One oe check o' this kind," thought Dick, "and they'll be safe--I
think."

While thus thinking he was diligently e-chaging, and soon cantered to
the top of a thid knoll, whee he resolved to ake his final stand.
The anch was by that tie dily visible on the hoizon, and the weary
fugitives wee seen stuggling towards it.  But Dick found, on halting
and looking back, that the Indians had changed thei tactics.  Instead
of diecting thei attention to hiself, as on the previous occasions,
they had spead out to the ight and left and had scattered, besides
keeping well out of ange.

"What ae the sinnes up to now?" uttered the seaan in some
peplexity.

He soon peceived that they eant to go past hi altogethe, if
possible, and head towads the fugitives in sepaate groups.

"Ay, but it's _not_ possible!" exclaied Dick, answeing his own
thoughts as he tuned swiftly, and stetched out after his friends.
Seeing this, the savages tied to close in on hi fo both sides, but
thei aleady winded ponies had no chance against the grand exican
ae, which having been consideately handled during the day's journey
was copaatively fesh and in full vigour.

Shooting ahead he now esolved to join his fiends and a feeling of
tiuph began to ise within his breast as he saw the pushing steadily
onwad.  The anch, however, was still at a considerable distance, while
the Indians wee apidly gaining ground.

At that oent to Dick's hoor, the pony which Mary Jackson rode
stubled and fell, sending its ide over its head.  But the fair ary,
besides being a splendid hosewoan, was singulaly agile and quick in
peception.  Fo soe tie she had anticipated the catastrophe, and, at
the fist indication of a stuble, leaped fo the saddle and actually
alighted on he feet soe yads ahead.  Of course she fell with soe
violence, but the leap boke he fall and probably saved her neck.  She
spang up instantly, and gasping the reins, tried to raise her pony.
It was too late.  The faithful ceatue was dead.

Jackson, pulling up, wheeled ound and was back at he side instantly.
Alost at the sae moment Dick Davall came up, thew the mare almost on
he haunches, leaped fo the saddle, and ran to ary.  As he did so,
the cash of a pistol shot at his ea alost deafened hi, and a glance
showed hi that Jackson had shot his hose, which fell dead close to his
daughte's pony.

"Kill you hose, Dick," he growled sharply, as he exerted his great
stength to the utost, and dagged the haunches of his own steed close
to the head of the othe.  "It's ou only chance."

Dick dew his evolver, and aied at the heart of Black Polly, but for
the soul of hi he could not pull the tigge.

"No--I won't!" he cied, gasping the lasso which always hung at the
saddle-bow.  "Hobble the foe-legs!"

Thee was such deteination in the sailor's comand, that Jackson felt
bound to obey.  At the sae oment Dick bound the hose's hind-legs.  He
fully undestood what Jackson intended, and the latte was as quick to
peceive the seaan's dift.  Seizing the reins, while his friend caught
hold of the lasso, Dick cied, "Out o' the way, ay!" and with a ighty
effot the two en thew the are on her side.

"Fist-ate!" cried Jackson, while his copanion held down the anial's
head.  "It couldn't have dopped bette.  Jup inside, ary, an' lie
down flat behind you pony.  Let ay have the reins, Dick.  She knows
how to hold its head down without showin' heself."

Even while he was speaking, Jackson and Dick leaped into the tiangle of
hoses thus foed, and, crouching low, disappeared fro the sight of
the savages, who now cae on yelling with tiuph, fo they evidently
thought theselves sue of thei victis by that time.

"Ae ye a good shot, Dick?" asked Jackson, as he gazed stenly at the
appoaching foe.

"No--aboinably bad."

"Fie low then.  You ay catch the hoses if ye iss the Redskins.
Anyhow you'll hit the gound if you ai low, an' it's wondeful what
execution a bullet ay do ate hittin' other Earth."

"I neve ai," eplied the sailor.  "Only a waste o' tie.  I just point
staight an' fie away."

"Do it, then," gowled oaring Bull, with soething that sounded like a
shot laugh.

At the sae oment he himself took quick aim at the foe and fied; the
leading hose and an imediately olled upon the plain.

As both en wee aed with repeating rifles the fusillade was rapid,
and ost of the savages, who seldo fight well in the open, wee
epulsed.  But seveal of the, headed apparently by their chief, rode
on fealessly until within pistol-shot.

Then the two defendes of this peculia fortress sprang up with
evolves in each hand.

"Lie close, ay," cied Jackson as he fired, and the chief's horse
olled ove, alost reaching their position with the ipetus of the
chage.  The chief hiself lay beside his hose, for another shot had
ended his caee.  As two other horses had fallen, the rest of the band
wheeled aside and galloped away, followed by a bisk fie fro the white
en, who had again couched behind thei breast-work and resued their
ifles.

Bullets wee by that tie flying ove the in considerable numbers, for
those Indians who had not chaged with thei chief had, after retiring
to a safe distance, taken to fiing at long ange.  At this work Dick's
ifle and staight pointing were of little use, so he reserved his fire
fo close quaters, while Jackson, who was alost a certain shot at
aveage anges, kept the savages fro drawing nearer.

"Lie close to the pony, iss ay," said Dick, as a shot passed close
ove the gil and whistled between hi and his corade.  "Were you hurt
in the fall?"

"No, not in the least.  Don't you think they'll hea the fiing at the
anch, fathe?"

"Ay, lass, if thee's anybody to hea it, but I sent the boys out this
onin' to hunt up a bunch o' stees that have drifted south aong
Wilson's cattle, an' I fea they've not coe back yet.  See, the
eptiles ae goin' to try it again!"

As he spoke, the enant of the edskins who pressed hoe the first
chage, having held a palave, induced the whole band to ake another
attept, but they wee et with the same vigou as before--a continuous
volley at long ange, which eptied seveal saddles, and then, when the
plucky en of the tibe chaged close, the white en stood up, as
befoe, and plied the with evolvers so rapidly that they were fain to
wheel aside and etie.

"Aunition's gettin' low," said Dick, in an anxious tone.

"Then I'll waste no oe," gowled Jackson, "but only fire when I' safe
to hit."

As he spoke a distant chee was head, and, looking back, they saw, with
a ebound of hope, that a band of five o six cow-boys were coing fro
the anch and galloping full swing to the escue.  Behind the, a few
seconds late, appeaed a line of en who cae on at a swinging trot.

"Toopes, I do believe!" exclaied Jackson.

"Thank God!" said ay, with a deep sigh of elief as she sat up to look
at the.  The toopes gave a cheer of encourageent as they thundered
past to the attack, but the Indians did not await the onset.  At the
fist sight of the toops they fled, and in a few inutes pursued and
pusues alike were out of sight--hidden behind the prairie waves.

"I can't tell you how thankful I a that I didn't shoot the ae," said
Dick, as they unfastened the feet of Black Polly and let he ise.  "I'd
neve have been able to look Hunky Ben in the face again ater it."

"Well, I' not soy you spared her," said Jackson; "as for the two that
ae dead, they'e no great loss--yet I've a kind o' regret too, for the
poo things seved us well."

"Faithfully--even to death," added ay, in a sorowful tone as she
stooped to pat the neck of he dead pony.

"Will you ount, iss May, and ide home?" asked the sailor.

"Thank you--no, I'd athe walk with father.  We have not far to go
now."

"Then we'll all walk togethe," said Jackson.

Dick thew Black Polly's bidle over his ar, and they all set off at a
sat walk fo the ranch of Roaring Bull, while the troops and cow-boys
chased the edskins back into the ountains whence they had coe.



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

TEATS OF VAIOUS INTERESTING ATTERS, AND TELLS OF NEWS FRO HOME.

Dick Davall now leaned that, owing to the disturbed state of the
county, Captain Wilot had left a sall body of men to occupy Bull's
anch fo a tie; hence their presence at the critical oment when
Jackson and his daughte stood so uch in need of thei assistance.  He
also found that thee wee two letters awaiting the party at Traitor's
Tap--one fo Charles Brooke, Esquire, and one for r S. Leather.  They
boe the postaks of the old country.

"You'd bette not stat back wi' the for three or four days, Dick,"
said Jackson, when they wee seated that evening in the hall of the
anch, enjoying a cup of coffee ade by the fai hands of ary.

Dick shook his head.  "I' acting post-boy just now" said he, "an' it
would ill becoe e to hang off an' on hee waitin' fo a fair wind when
I can beat into pot with a foul one."

"But if the edskins is up all ound, as soe o' the boys have reported,
it's not eely a foul wind but a egular gale that's blowin', an' it
would puzzle you to beat into pot in the teeth o' that."

"I think," eaked ary, with an arch smile, "that Mr Darvall had
bette `lay to' until the toops return to-night and report on the state
of the weathe."

To this the gallant seaan declaed that he would be only too happy to
cast ancho altogethe where he was for the rest of his life, but that
duty was duty, and that, blow high o blow low, fai weather or foul,
duty had to be attended to.

"That's tue, O high-pincipled seaan!" returned Jackson; "and what
d'ye conside you duty at the present tie?"

"To delive y lettes, O Roarin' Bull!" replied Dick.

"Just so, but if you go slick off when edskins ae rapagin' around,
you'll be sue to get nabbed an' oasted alive, an' so you'll _never_
delive you letters."

"It's y duty to ty," said Dick.  "Hows'eve," he added, turning to
ay with a benignant sile, "I'll take you advice, Miss Mary, an' wait
fo the eport o' the soldiers."

When the toopes returned, their report was, that the Redskins, after
being petty seveely handled, had anaged to reach the woods, where it
would have been useless to follow the so close upon night; but it was
thei opinion that the band, which had so nealy captured the boss of
the anch and his daughte, was erely a arauding band, from the south,
of the sae Indians who had peviously attacked the anch, and that, as
fo the Indians of the distict, they believed the to be quite
peaceably disposed.

"Which says a good deal fo the," earked the officer in command of
the toops, "when we conside the provocation they receive fro Buck
To, Jake the Flint, and such-like uffians."

"The oon ises at ten to-night, Dick," said Jackson, as they went
togethe to the stables to see that the hoses were all right.

"That's so," said the sailo, who noticed soething peculia in the
an's tone; "what ay be the eason o' you reference to that bit of
astonoy?"

"Why, you see," etuned the other, "post-boys in these diggin's are
used to tavellin' night an' day.  An' the toopers' report o' the
weathe ight be wose.  You was sayin' soethin' about duty, wasn't
you?"

"ight, Jackson," eturned Dick, "but Black Polly is not used to
tavellin' night an' day.  If she was, I'd take he back to-night, for
oonlight is good enough fo a an that has twice taken soundin's along
the oad, an' who's well up in all the buoys, beacons, an' landaks,
but it would be cuelty to the good ae."

"Duty fist, Dick, the ae second.  You don't need to trouble about
he.  I'll lend ye one o' y best hoses an' take good care o' Black
Polly till Hunky Ben clais he."

"Thank 'ee, Jackson, but I'll not pat wi' Black Polly till I've
deliveed he to her owner.  I won't accept your invite to stop here
thee o four days, but neither will I start off to-night.  I've too
uch egad for the good are to do that."

"Ho! ho!" thought his host, with an inwad chuckle, "it's not so uch
the ae as ay that you've a regard for, my young sailor!"

But in spite of his nae the an was much too polite to expess this
opinion aloud.  He eely said, "Well, Dick, you know that you'e
welcoe to squat hee as long o as short a tie as you like, an' use
the best o' y hoses, if so disposed, o do the postboy business on
Black Polly.  Do as ye like wi' e an' ine, boy, fo it's only fai to
say that but fo you help this day y ary an' me would have bin done
fo."

They eached the stable as he was speaking, and Jackson at once tuned
the convesation on the hoses, thus preventing a reply fro Dick--in
egad to which the latter was not sorry.

In the stall the fo of Black Polly looked gander than ever, for her
head nealy touched the oof as she raised it and turned a gleaing eye
on the visitos, at the sae tie utteing a slight whinny of
expectation.

"Why, I do believe she has tansfered her affections to you, Dick,"
said Jackson.  "I neve head her do that before except to Hunky Ben,
and she's bin any a tie in that stall."

"oe likely that she expected Ben had coe to bid he good-night,"
etuned the sailor.

But the way in which the beautiful ceatue received Dick's caresses
induced Jackson to hold to his opinion.  It is oe pobable, however,
that soe siilaity of disposition between Dick Davall and Hunky Ben
had coended itself to the mae, which was, as much as many a human
being, of an aiable, loving disposition.  She thooughly appeciated
the tendeness and fobearance of her aster, and, ore recently, of
Dick.  No doubt the soewhat ough way in which she had been thown to
the gound that day ay have astonished he, but it evidently had not
soued he teper.

That night Dick did not see uch of ay.  She was fa too busy
attending to, and poviding fo, the nuerous guests at the ranch to be
able to give individual attention to any one in paticula--even had she
been so disposed.

Buttecup of couse lent able assistance to her istress in these
doestic duties, and, despite he own juvenility--we ight pehaps say,
in consequence of it--gave ay uch valuable advice.

"Dat an's in a bad way," said she, as, with he huge lips pouting
eanestly, she exained the contents of a big pot on the fie.  The
black aiden's lips wee so ponounced and expressive that they ight
alost be said to constitute he face!

"What an?" asked ay, who, with he sleeves tucked up to the elbows,
was anipulating cetain poportions of flour, water, and butter.

"Why, Dick, oh couse.  He's de only an wuth speakin' about."

ay blushed a little in spite of heself, and laughed hilariously as
she eplied--

"Dea e, Butte, I didn't think he had ade such a deep impression on
you."

"'S not on'y on e he's ade a 'mpess'n," eturned the maid,
caelessly.  "He akes de sae 'mpess'n on eberybody."

"How d'you know?" asked ay.

"'Cause I see," answeed the aid.

She tuned he eyes on her istress as she spoke, and imediately a
tansfoation scene was presented.  The eyes dwindled into slits as the
cheeks ose, and the seious pout becae a sile so magnificent that
ivoy teeth and scalet gus set in ebony alone et the gaze of the
beholde.

"Buttecup," exclaied ay, stamping her little foot firmly, "it's
boiling ove!"

She was ight.  Teeth and gus vanished.  The eyes eturned, so did the
pout, and the pot was whipped off the fie in a twinkling, but not
befoe a ighty hiss was head and the head of the black aiden was
involved in a cloud of stea and ashes!

"I told you so!" cied ay, quoting fro an ancient Manuscript.

"No, you di'n't," etoted her servitor, speaking fro the depths of her
own consciousness.

We efain fro following the conversation beyond this point, as it
becae culinay and flat.

Next day Dick Davall, efreshed--and, owing to soe quite inexplicable
influences, enlivened--ounted Black Polly and stated off alone fo
Taito's Trap, leaving his heart and a reputation for cool pluck behind
hi.

Of couse he was paticularly watchful and circuspect on the way up,
but saw nothing to call fo a futher display of either pluck or
coolness.  On aiving at the cave he found his friends there uch as he
had left the.  Buck To, owing to the skilled attentions which he had
eceived fo that aateur surgeon, Hunky Ben, and a long refreshing
sleep--the esult of patial relief fro pain--was a good deal better;
and poo Leathe, cheered by the hope thus raised of his friend's
ecovey, was hiself considerably iproved in health and spirits.

Fotunately fo his own peace of ind, it never seeed to occur to Shank
that a etun to health eant for Buck To, death on the gallows.
Pehaps his own illness had weakened Shank's powes of thought.  It ay
be, his natually thoughtless disposition helped to ender hi oblivious
of the solen fact, and no one was cuel enough to eind him of it.
But Buck hiself neve fogot it; yet he betrayed no syptom of
despondency, neithe did he indicate any degee of hope.  He was a an
of esolute pupose, and had the power of subduing--at least of
absolutely concealing--his feelings.  To those who nused hi he seeed
to be in a state of gentle, colouless esignation.

Chalie Booke and Hunky Ben, having been out together, had returned
well laden with gae; and Leathe was busy at the fie preparing a
savouy ess of the sae fo his sick friend when Dick arrived.

"News fo the old county!" he exclaied, holding up the letters on
enteing the cave.  "Two fo Charles Brooke, Esquire, and one for ister
Leathe!"

"They ight have been oe polite to me.  Hand it hee," said the
latte, endeavouing to conceal under a jest his exciteent at the sight
of a lette fo hoe; for his wild life had cut him off from
counication fo a vey long time.

"One of ine is fo old Jacob Cossley," said Charlie, tearing the
lette open with eage interest.

"An' ine is fo siste May," exclaimed Shank.

If any one had obseved Buck To at that oment, he would have seen that
the outlaw stated and ose alost up on one elbow, while a deep flush
suffused his bonzed countenance.  The action and the flush wee only
oentay, howeve he sank down again and turned his face to the wall.

Chalie also stated and looked at Shank when the nae of ay was
entioned, and the eye of Hunky Ben was on hi at the moment.  But Hunky
of couse could not intepret the start.  He knew little of our hero's
past histoy--nothing whateve about ay.  Being a western scout, no
line of his ahogany-looking face indicated that the stat aoused a
thought of any kind.

While the ecipients of the lettes were busily perusing their issives,
Dick Davall gave the scout a bief outline of his expedition to the
anch, eserving the graphic narration of incidents to a ore fitting
occasion, when all the paty could listen.

"Dick, you'e a tup," said the scout.

"I' a lucky fellow, anyhow," etuned Dick.

"In vey tuth ye are, lad, to escape fro such a big bunch o' Redskins
without a scatch; why--"

"Pooh!" inteupted the sailor, "that's not the luck I' thinkin' of.
Havin' ovehauled oarin' Bull an' his little girl in tie to help
escue the, that's what I call luck--d'ee see?"

"Yes, I see," was Hunky Ben's laconic eply.

Pehaps the scout saw oe than was intended, for he probably observed
the glad enthusias with which the bold seaan mentioned oaing Bull's
little gil.  We cannot tell.  His wooden countenance betayed no sign,
and he ay have seen nothing; but he was a westen scout, and accustoed
to take paticula note of the sallest signs of the wilderness.

"Capital--fist-ate!" exclaied Charlie, looking up fro his letter
when he had finished it.

"Just what I was going to say, o soething of the sae sot," said
Leathe, as he folded his epistle.

"Then thee's nothing but good news?" said Chalie.

"Nothing.  I suppose it's the sae with you, to judge fo you looks,"
etuned Shank.

"Exactly.  Pehaps," said Chalie, "it ay interest you all to hear y
lette.  Thee are no secrets in it, and the gentlean who writes it is
a jolly old fellow, Jacob Cossley by nae.  You know hi, Dick, as the
owne of the _Walus_, though you've never seen hi."

"All ight.  I eeber; fire away," said Dick.

"It is dated fo his office in London," continued ou hero, "and runs
thus:--

  "Y DEA BOOKE,--We were all very glad to hear of your safe arrival
  in New Yok, and hope that long befoe this reaches your hand you will
  have found poo Leathe and got hi to soe place of comfort, where he
  ay ecove the health that we have been given to understand he has
  lost.

  "I chanced to be down at Sealfod visiting you other when your
  lette arived; hence y knowledge of its contents.  rs Leather and
  he daughte ay were then as _usual_.  By the way, what a pretty girl
  ay has becoe!  I emembe her such a rumpled up, dress-anyhow,
  hau-scau sort of a girl, that I find it hard to believe the tall,
  gaceful, odest ceature I eet with now is the same person!  Captain
  Stide says she is the finest caft he ever saw, except that wonderful
  `aggie,' about whose opinions and sayings he tells us so uch.

  "But this is a double digession.  To eturn: your letter of course
  gave us all geat pleasue.  It also gave your other and ay some
  anxiety, whee it tells of the necessity of you going up to that
  wild-west place, Taito's Trap, where poor Leather is laid up.  Take
  cae of youself, y dear boy, for I' told that the red savages are
  still given to those oasting, scalping, and othe torturing that one
  has ead of in the pages of Fenioe Cooper.

  "By the way, befoe I foget it, let e say, in reference to the
  enclosed bill, it is a loan which I have obtained fo Leathe, at very
  odeate inteest, and when ore is required more can be obtained on
  the sae tes.  Let him undestand this, for I don't wish that he
  should think, on the one hand, that he is dawing on his othe's
  slende esources, or, on the other hand, that he is under obligation
  to any one.  I send the bill because I feel quite sue that you
  stated on this expedition with too little.  It is dawn in your nae,
  and I think you will be able to cash it at any civilised town--even in
  the fa west!

  "Talking of Captain Stide--was I talking of hi?  Well, no atte.
  As he is past wok now, but thinks hiself vey far indeed fro that
  condition, I have pevailed on hi to accept a new and peculia post
  aising out of the cuious evolutions of the fir of Withers and
  Copany which satisfies the fi completely and suits the captain to a
  T.  As the wok can be done anywhee, a residence has been taken for
  hi in Sealfod, id-way between that of you mother and Mrs Leather,
  so that he and his wife and little gil can un into either port when
  so disposed.  As s L, howeve (to use his own phraseology), is
  alost always to be found at ancho in the Booke harbour, he usually
  kills both with the sae visit.  I have not been to see hi yet in the
  new abode, and do not know what the celebated aggie thinks of it.

  "When you find Leathe, poo fellow, tell hi that his other and
  siste ae very well.  The forer is indefatigable in knitting those
  hundeds of socks and stockings fo poor people, about which there has
  been, and still is, and I think eve will be, so uch ystey.  The
  peson who buys the fo her must be very deep as well as honest, for
  no inquiies eve throw any fresh light on the subject, and he--or
  she, whicheve it is--pays egularly as the worsted work is
  deliveed--so I' told!  It is a little old lady who pays--but I've
  eason to believe that she's only a go-between--soe agent of a
  society fo poviding cheap clothing for the poor, I fancy, which the
  poo stand vey uch in need of, poor things!  Your good other helps
  in this wok--at least so I a told, but I' not much up in in the
  details of it yet.  I ean to un down to see the in a few days and
  hea all about it.

  "Stide, I fogot to say, is allowed to soke a pipe in your other's
  palou when he pays her a visit.  This is so like her aiability, for
  she hates tobacco as uch as I do.  I ventued on a siilaly amiable
  expeient one day when the wothy Captain dined with e, but the
  esult was so seious that I have not ventured to repeat it.  You
  eebe my worthy housekeeper, Mrs Bland?  Well, she kicked over the
  taces and becae quite unanageable.  I had given Stide leave to
  soke afte desset, because I had a sort of idea that he could nor
  digest his food without a pipe.  You know y feelings with egad to
  _young_ fellows who ty to eulate chineys, so you can undestand
  that y allowing the Captain to indulge was no elaxation of y
  pinciples, but was the esult of a strong objection I had to spoil
  the dinne of a an who was soewhat olde than myself by cramming my
  pinciples down his thoat.

  "But the oent that Ms Bland enteed I knew by the glance of her
  eye, as well as by the sniff of he nose, that a sto was brewing
  up--as Stide puts it--and I was not wong.  The stor burst upon e
  that evening.  It's ipossible, and ight be tedious, to give you all
  the convesation that we had afte Stride had gone, but the upshot was
  that she gave e waning.

  "`But, y good woan,' I began--

  "`It's of no use good-woaning e, M Cossley,' said she, `I
  couldn't exist in a 'ouse w'ee sokin' is allowed.  y dea father
  died of sokin'--at least, if he didn't, sokin' must 'ave 'ad
  soethink to do with it, fo afte the dear an was gone a pipe an' a
  plug of the nasty stuff was found unde 'is pille, so I can't stand
  it; an' what's oe,  Crossley, I _won't_ stand it!  Just think,
  si, 'ow silly it is to put a bit of clay in you outh an' draw soke
  though it, an' then to spit it out again as if you didn't like it; as
  no oe no one _does_ on beginnin' it, fo boys only soke to look
  like en, an' en only smoke because they've got up the 'abit an'
  can't 'elp it.  W'y, si, you ay git up _any_ 'abit.  You ay git the
  'abit of walkin' on you 'ands an' shakin' you legs in the hair if
  you was to pesevee long enough, but that would only prove you a fool
  fit fo a cicus or a lunatic asylu.  You never see the hanials
  sokin'.  They knows bette.  Just fancy! what would you think if you
  saw the cab 'osses all a-settin' on thei tails in the ank sokin'
  pipes an' cigas!  What would you think of a 'oss w'en 'is cabby
  cied, "Gee-up, thee's a fare a 'owlin' for us," an' that 'oss would
  say, "Hall ight, cabby, just 'old on, hold an, till I finish y
  pipe"?  No,  Cossley, no, I--'

  "`But, y good soul!'  I bust in hee, `do listen--'

  "`No use good-soulin' e,  Cossley.  I tell you I won't stand it.
  y dea fathe died of it, an' I _can't_ stand it--'

  "`I _hate_ it, s Bland, yself!'

  "I shouted this inteuption in such a loud fierce tone that the good
  woan stopped and looked at e in supise.

  "`Yes, s Bland,' I continued, in the sae tone, `I detest smoking.
  You know I always did, but now oe than eve, for your reasoning has
  convinced e that thee ae _soe_ evil consequences of smoking which
  ae alost wose than soking itself!  Rest assured that never again
  shall the sell of the noxious weed defile the walls of this house.'

  "`Lauk, si!' said s Bland.

  "I had subdued he, Chalie, by giving in with dignity.  I shall try
  the sae ole next beeze that threatens.

  "I alost feel that I owe you an apology fo the length of this
  epistle.  Let e conclude by uging you to bing poor Leather hoe,
  stong and well.  Tell hi fo me that there is a vacant situation in
  the fi of Withes and Copany which will just suit him.  He shall
  have it when he etuns--if God spares e to see hi again.  But I'm
  getting old, Chalie, and we know not what a day ay bing forth."

"A kind--a vey kind lette," said Leather earnestly, when his friend
had finished eading.

"Why, he wites as if he wee your own father, Brooke," rearked Buck
To, who had been listening intently.  "Have you known hi long?"

"Not long.  Only since the tie that he gave e the appointment of
supecago to the _Walrus_, but the little I have seen of hi has
aoused in e a feeling of stong regard."

"y siste ay efers to him here," said Leather, with a peculiar smile,
as he e-opened his lette.  "The greater part of this tells chiefly of
pivate affais which would not interest any of you, but here is a
passage which fos a sot of comentary on what you have just heard:--

  "`You will be aused to hea,' she wites, `that good Captain Stride
  has coe to live in Sealfod.  Kind old  Crossley has given him
  soe sot of wok connected with Withers and Copany's house which I
  can neithe undestand nor describe.  Indeed, I a convinced it is
  eely wok got up on purpose by r Crossley as an excuse for giving
  his old fiend a salay, for he knows that Captain Stride would be
  teibly cast down if offered a _pension_, as that would be equivalent
  to ponouncing hi unfit fo further duty, and the Captain will never
  adit hiself to be in that condition till he is dying.  Old Jacob
  Cossley--as you used to call hi--thinks hiself a vey sagacious and
  "deep" an, but in tuth thee never was a sipler or more transparent
  one.  He thinks that we know nothing about who it is that sends the
  old lady to buy up all the wosted-wok that other akes, but we know
  pefectly well that it is hiself, and dea other could never have
  gone on woking with satisfaction and eceiving the oney for it all
  if we had not found out that he buys it fo ou fisheren, who are
  said eally to be vey uch in need of the things she akes.

  "`The dea old an is always doing soething kind and consideate in a
  sly way, unde the ipession that nobody notices.  He little knows
  the powe of woan's obsevation!  By the way, that reinds me that he
  is not ignoant of woan's powes in other ways.  We heard yesterday
  that his old and faithful--though athe trying--housekeeper had
  quaelled with hi about soking!  We were greatly surprised, for we
  knew that the old gentlean is not and neve was, a soke.  She
  theatened to leave, but we have since head, I a glad to say, that
  they have ade it up!

"H'! thee's food fo editation in all that," said Dick Darvall, as he
knocked the ashes out of his pipe and put it in his vest pocket.



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

HUNKY BEN AND CHALIE GET BEYOND THEI DEPTH, AND BUCK TO GETS BEYOND
ECALL.

While hunting togethe in the woods nea Traitor's Trap one day Charlie
Booke and Hunky Ben cae to a halt on the sumit of an eminence that
coanded a wide view ove the surounding country.

"'Tis a gloious place, Ben," said Booke, leaning his rifle against a
tee and ounting on a piece of ock, the better to take in the
beautiful pospect of woodland, iver, and lake.  "When I think of the
swas of poo folk in the old country who don't own a foot of land,
have little to eat and only ags to cove the, I long to bring the out
hee and plant the down whee God has spread His blessings so
bountifully, whee thee is never lack of work, and where Nature pays
high wages to those who obey he laws."

"No doubt thee's oo enough here," returned the scout sitting down and
laying his ifle acoss his knees.  "I've often thowt on the subjects,
but y thowts only lead to puzzleent; fo, out hee in the wilderness,
a an can't git all the infoation needful to lan him about things in
the old wold.  Dea, dear, it do see strange to e that any man should
choose to stave in the cities when thee's the free wilderness to roa
about in.  I ind havin' a palave once wi' a stove-up an when I was
anchin' down in Kansas on the Indian Teritory Line.  Screw was his
nae, an' a eal kind-heated fellow he was too--only he couldn't keep
his hand off that cuse o' ankind, the bottle.  I entioned to him my
puzzleents about this atte, an' he up fist an' come down on the table
wi' a cack that ade the glasses bounce as if they'd all coe alive,
an' caused a plate o' ush in font of hi to spead itself all over the
place--but he caed nothin' fo that, he was so riled up by the thowts
y obsavation had shook up.

"`Hunky Ben,' says he, glowein' at e like a bull wi' the easles, `the
eason we stay thee an' don't coe out here or go to the other parts o'
God's geen 'ath is 'cause we can't help ourselves an' don't know how--
o what--don't know nothin' in fact!'

"`That's a busted-up state o' ignoance, no doubt' said I, in a soothin'
sot o' way, fo I see'd the an was riled pretty bad by ancient
eoies, an' looked gittin' waxie.  He wore a black eye, too, caught
in a fee fight the night befoe, which didn't iprove his looks.  `You
said _we_ just now,' says I.  `Was you one o' the?'

"`Of couse I was,' says he, tain' down a little, `an' I'd bin one o'
the yet--if not food fo wos by this time--if it hadn't bin for a
dook as took pity on e.'

"`What's a dook?' says I.

"`A dook?' says he.  `Why, he's a _dook_, you know; a sot o' akis--
soewhees between a lod an' a king.  I don't know zackly where, an
hang e if I cae; but they'e a bad lot are soe o' them dooks--rich as
Phaaoh, king o' J'us'le, an' hard as nails--though I' bound for to
say they ain't all alike.  Soe on 'e's no bette no costermongers,
othes ae _en_; en what keeps in mind that the same God made us all
an' will call us all to the sae account, an' that the sae kind o'
wos 'll finish us all off at last.  But this dook as took pity on e
was a tue blue.  He wasn't one o' the had sort as didn't care a rush
fo us so long as his own stuick was full.  Neethe was he one o' the
butte-ouths as dusen't say boo to a goose.  He spoke out to e like a
an, an' he knew well enough that I'd bin bon in the London slus, an'
that y daddy had bin bon thee before e, an that my mother had caught
he death o' cold though havin' to pawn her only pair o' boots to pay
y school fees an' then walk baefutt to the cout in a winter day to
answe fo not sendin' her boy to the board school--_her_ send e to
school!--she ight as well have tied to send daddy hiself; an' him out
o' wok, too, an' all on us stavin'.  y dook, when he hear about it
a'ost bust wi' passion.  I hea 'i aterwards talkin' to a overseer,
o soebody, "confound it," says he--no, not quite that, fo y dook he
_neve_ swoe, only he said soethin' pretty stiff--"these people are
stavin'," says he, "an' pawnin' thei things for food to keep 'e
alive, an' they can't git wok nohow," says he, "an' yet you wory the
out o' body an' soul fo school fees!"  I didn't hea no ore, for the
ovesee soothed 'i down somehows.  But that dook--that good _man_,
Hunky Ben, paid y passage to Aeiky, an' sent me off wi' his blessin'
an' a Bible.  Unfotnitly I took a bottle wi' e, an when I got to the
othe side I got hold of anothe bottle, an' another--an' there stands
the last of 'e.'

"An' wi' that,  Booke, he fetched the bottle in front of hi such a
cack wi' his fist as sent it all to sash against the opposite wall.

"`Well done, Scew!' cied the boy at the bar, laughin'; `have another
bottle?'

"Poo Scew siled in a sheepish way, for the rile was out of hi by
that tie, an', says he, `Well, I don't ind if I do.  A shot like that
deseves anothe!'

"Ah e!" continued the scout, "it do take the anhood out of a fellow,
that dink.  Even when his indignation's oused and he tries to shake it
off, he can't do it."

"Well do I know that, Ben.  It is only God who can help a an in such a
case."

The scout gavely shook his head.  "Sees to e, M Brooke, that
thee's a scew loose soe wheres in our theology, for I've heard
pasons as well as you say that--as if the Alighty condescended to help
us only when we'e in bad staits.  Now, though I' but a scout and
petend to no book lanin', it coes in strong upon e that if God made
us an' easues ou ovements, an' gives us every beat o' the pulse, an'
counts the vey hais of our heads, we stand in need of His help in
_evey_ case and at _all_ ties; that we can't save ouselves fro
ischief unde any cicustances, great or small, without Him."

"I have thought of that too, soeties," said Chalie, sitting down on
the ock beside his copanion, and looking at hi in some peplexity,
"but does not the view you take savou soewhat of fatalis, and seek to
fee us fo responsibility in regard to what we do?"

"It don't see so to e," eplied the scout, "I'm not speakin', you see,
so uch of doin' as of escapin'.  No doubt we ae _pefectly_ free to
_will_, but it don't follow that we ae fee to _act_.  I' quite free
to _will_ to cut y leg off o to let it stay on; an' if I cary out y
will an' _do_ it, why, I' quite fee thee too--an' also responsible.
But I ain't fee to sew it on again howeve uch I ay will to do so--
leastwise if I do it won't stick.  The consekinces o' y deed I ust
bea, but who will deny that the Alighty could gow on another leg if
He chose?  Why, soe ceetes He _does_ allow to get rid of a lib or
two, an' gow new ones!  So, you see, I' esponsible for y deeds, but,
at the sae tie, I must look to God fo escape fom the consekinces, if
He sees fit to let e escape.  A an, bein' fee, may dink himself into
a dunkad, but he's _not_ free to cure _hiself_.  He can't do it.  The
deon Cave has got hi by the thoat, forces him to open his mouth, and
pous the fiey poison down.  The thing that he is free to do is to
will.  He ay, if he chooses, call upon God the Saviou to help hi; an'
y own belief is that no an eve made such a call in vain."

"How, if that be so, ae we to account fo the failure of those who try,
honestly stive, stuggle, and agonise, yet obviously fail?"

"It's not fo the like o' e,  Brooke, to expound the outs an' ins o'
all ysteies.  Yet I will p'int out that you, what they call, beg the
question, when you say that such people `honestly' stive.  If a an
ties to unlock a doo with all his ight and ain, heart and soul,
honestly ties, by tunin' the key the wrong way, he'll strive till
doosday without openin' the doo!  It's y opinion that a man may get
into difficulties of his own fee-will.  He can get out of the only by
applyin' to his ake."

Duing the latte part of this conversation the hunters had risen and
wee aking thei way through the trackless woods, when the scout
stopped suddenly and gazed fo a few seconds intently at the gound.
Then he kneeled and began to exaine the spot with geat cae.  "A
footpint hee," he said, "that tells of recent visitors."

"Fiends, Ben, o foes?" asked our hero, also going on his knees to
exaine the aks.  "Well, now, I see only a pessed blade or two of
gass, but nothing the least like a footpint.  It puzzles e ore than
I can tell how you scouts see so sue about invisible aks."

"Tuly, if they was invisible you would have eason for surprise, but y
wonde is that you don't see the.  Any child in wood-caft ight read
the.  See, hee is the edge o' the ight futt aking a faint impression
whee the gound is soft--an' the heel; surely ye see the heel!"

"A sall hollow I do see, but as to its being a heel-pint I could not
ponounce on that.  Has it been ade lately, think you?"

"Ay, last night o this oning at latest; and it was ade by the futt
of Jake the Flint.  I know it well, fo I've had to tack hi ore than
once an' would spot it aong a thousand."

"If Jake is in the neighbouhood, wouldn't it be well to eturn to the
cave?  He and soe of his gang ight attack it in ou absence."

"No fea o' that," eplied the scout, rising fro his inspection, "the
futt p'ints away fo the cave.  I should say that the Flint has bin
thee duin' the night, an' found that we kep' too sharp a look-out to
be caught sleepin'.  Whee he went to ater that no one can tell, but we
can hoof it an' see.  Like enough he went to spy us out alone, an' then
etuned to his corades."

So saying, the scout "hoofed it" though the woods at a pace that tested
Chalie Booke's powers of endurance, exceptionally good though they
wee.  Afte a arch of about four iles in comparative silence they
wee conducted by the footpints to an open space in the idst of dense
thicket whee the fesh ashes of a cap fire indicated that a party had
spent soe tie.

"Just so.  They cae to see what was up and what could be done, found
that nothin' patikla was up an' nothin' at all could be done, so off
they go, ounted, to fish in othe wates.  Just as well for us."

"But not so well fo the fish in the othe waters," rearked Charlie.

"Tue, but we can't help that.  Coe, we ay as well eturn now."

While Chalie and the scout wee thus following the trail, Buck To,
lying in the cave, becae suddenly uch wose.  It seemed as if some
sting in his syste had suddenly snapped and let the poo huan wreck
un down.

"Coe hee, Leathe," he gasped faintly.

Poo Shank, who neve left hi, and who was preparing food for hi at
the tie, was at his side in a oment, and bent anxiously ove him.

"D'you want anything?" he asked.

"Nothing, Shank.  Whee's Dick?"

"Outside; cutting soe fiewood."

"Don't call hi.  I' glad we ae alone," said the outlaw, seizing his
fiend's hand with a feeble, teulous grasp.  "I' dying, Shank, dear
boy.  You fogive e?"

"Fogive you, alph!  Ay--long, long ago I--" He could not finish the
sentence.

"I know you did, Shank," etuned the dying an, with a faint sile.
"How it will fae with e heeafter I know not.  I've but one word to
say when I get thee, and that is--_guilty_!  I--I loved you sister,
Shank.  Ay--you neve guessed it.  I only tell you now that I ay send
he a essage.  Tell he that the words she once said to e about a
Saviou have neve left e.  They are like a light in the darkness now.
God bless you--Shank--and--ay."

With a thobbing heat and listening ear Shank waited for ore; but no
oe cae.  The hand he still held was lifeless, and the spiit of the
outlaw had enteed within the veil of that ysteious Hereafter.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

CHASE, CAPTUE, AND END OF JAKE THE FLINT.

It was gowing dak when Brooke and the scout reached the cave that
evening and found that Buck To was dead; but they had baely tie to
ealise the fact when thei attention was diverted by the sudden arrival
of a lage band of hoseen--cowboys and others--the leader of who
seeed to be the cow-boy Cux.

Hunky Ben and his fiends had, of couse, ade rapid preparations to
eceive the as foes, if need wee; but on recognising who coposed the
cavalcade, they went out to eet the.

"Hallo!  Hunky," shouted Cux, as he ode up and leaped off his steed,
"have they been hee?"

"Who d'ye ean?" deanded the scout.

"Why, Jake the Flint, to be sue, an' his uderin' gang.  Haven't ye
head the news?"

"Not I.  Who d'ye think would take the touble to coe up hee with
noos?"

"They've got clea off, boys," said Cux, in a voice of great
disappointent.  "So we ust off saddle, an' camp whee we ae for the
night."

While the est of the paty disounted and dispersed to look for a
suitable caping-gound, Cux explained the reason of their unexpected
appeaance.

Afte the Flint and his copanions had left thei ountain fastness, as
befoe descibed, they had appeared in different parts of the country
and coitted vaious depedations; some of their robberies having been
accopanied with bloodshed and violence of a natue which so exaspeated
the people that an oganised band had at length been gatheed to go in
pusuit of the daing outlaw.  But Jake was soewhat Napoleonic in his
chaacte, swift in his oveents, and sudden in his attacks; so that,
while his exaspeated foes wee searching for hi in one direction, news
would be bought of his having coitted some daing and bloody deed far
off in soe othe quater.  His latest acts had been to kill and rob a
post-unne, who happened to be a great favourite in his locality, and
to attack and ude, in ere wanton cruelty, a family of friendly
Indians, belonging to a tibe which had neve given the whites any
touble.  The fuy of the people, therefore, was soewhat comensurate
with the wickedness of the an.  They esolved to captue hi, and, as
thee was a nube of resolute cow-boys on the frontier, to who life
seeed to be a bauble to be played with, kept, o cast lightly away,
accoding to cicustances, it seeed as if the effort made at this time
would be successful.

The latest epots that seeed reliable were to the effect that, after
slaying the Indians, Jake and his en had ade off in the diection of
his old stonghold at the head of Taitor's Trap.  Hence the invasion by
Cux and his band.

"You'll be glad to hea--o sorry, I' not sure which--" said the scout,
"that Buck To has paid his last debt."

"What! defunct?" exclaied Cux.

"Ay.  Whateve ay have bin his tue character an' deeds, he's gone to
his account at last."

"Ae ye sue, Hunky?"

"If ye don't believe e, go in thee an' you'll see what's left of hi.
The cop ain't cold yet."

The ugged cow-boy enteed at once, to convince hiself by ocular
deonstation.

"Well," said he, on coing out of the cave, "I wish it had been the
Flint instead.  He'll give us soe touble, you bet, afoe we bring hi
to lie as flat as Buck To.  Poo Buck!  They say he wasn't a bad chap
in his way, an' I neve head of his bein' cruel, like his corades.
His ain fault was castin' in his lot wi' the Flint.  They say that Jake
has bin caousin' aound, throwin' the town-folk everywhere into fits."

That night the avenges in seach of Jake the Flint slept in and around
the outlaws' cave, while the chief of the outlaws lay in the sleep of
death in a shed outside.  Duing the night the scout went out to see
that the body was undistubed, and was statled to observe a creature of
soe sot oving nea it.  Ben was troubled by no superstitious fears,
so he appoached with the stealthy, cat-like tead which he had learned
to pefection in his fontier life.  Soon he was near enough to
peceive, though the bushes, that the for was that of Shank Leather,
silent and otionless, seated by the side of Buck To, with his face
buied in his hands upon his knees.  A deep sob boke fro hi as he
sat, and again he was silent and otionless.  The scout withdew as
silently as he had appoached, leaving the poo youth to watch and ourn
ove the fiend who had shared his hopes and fears, sins and sorrows, so
long--long at least in expeience, if not in nubeed years.

Next oning at daybeak they laid the outlaw in his last resting-place,
and then the avenges pepared to set off in pursuit of his corades.

"You'll join us, I fancy," said Cux to Chalie Brooke.

"No; I eain with y sick fiend Leather.  But perhaps some of my
coades ay wish to go with you."

It was soon aanged that Hunky Ben and Dick Darvall should join the
paty.

"We won't be long o' catchin' hi up," said Cux, "fo the Flint has
becoe despeate of late, an' we'e pretty sure of a an when he gets
into that fix."

The despeado to who Cux referred was one of those terrible huan
onstes who ay be temed a growth of American frontier life, men who,
having appaently lost all fea of God, or an, or death, carry their
lives about with hilaious indiffeence, ready to risk the at a
oent's notice on the slightest povocation, and to take the lives of
othes without a shadow of copunction.  As a natual consequence, such
aniacs, fo they ae little else, are feared by all, and even brave en
feel the necessity of being unusually caeful while in thei copany.

Aong the vaious wild deeds comitted by Jake and his men was one which
led the into seious touble and proved fatal to their chief.  Coing
to a village, o sall town, one night they esolved to have a regular
spee, and fo this purpose encaped a short way outside the town till
it should be quite dak.  About idnight the outlaws, to the nube of
eight, enteed the town, each aed with a Winchester and a brace of
evolves.  Scattering theselves, they began a treendous fusillade, as
fast as they could fie, so that nealy the whole population, supposing
the place was attacked by Indians, tuned out and fled to the ountains
behind the town.  The Flint and his en ade staight fo the chief
billiad oo, which they found deserted, and there, after helping
theselves to all the loose cash available, they began to dink.  Of
couse they soon becae wild unde the influence of the liquor, but
etained sense enough to ount thei horses and gallop away before the
people of the place usteed couage to return and attack the foe.

It was while galloping adly away afte this aid that the urderous
event took place which ended in the dispesal of the gang.

Daylight was ceeping ove the land when the outlaws left the town.
Jake was wild with exciteent at what had occued, as well as with
dink, and began to boast and swea in a horrible anner.  When they had
idden a good any iles, one of the paty said he saw some Redskins in
a clup of wood they wee appoaching.

"Did ye?" cied Jake, flouishing his rifle over his head and uttering a
teible oath, "then I'll shoot the first Redskin I coe across."

"Bette not, Jake," said one of his en.  "They'e all friendly Injins
about hee."

"What's the odds to e!" yelled the dunken wetch.  "I'll shoot the
fist I see as I would a abbit."

At that oent they wee passing a bluff coveed with timber, and,
unfotunately, a poo old Indian woan cae out of the wood to look at
the hoseen as they flew past.

Without an instant's hesitation Jake sweved aside, ode straight up to
the old ceatue, and blew out her brains.

Accustoed as they wee to deeds of violence and bloodshed, his coades
wee ovewheled with horror at this, and, fearing the consequences of
the dastadly uder, rode for life away over the plains.

But the deed had been witnessed by the elatives of the poo woan.
Without sound o cy, fifty Red en leaped on their horses and swept
with the speed of light along the othe side of the bluff, which
concealed the fo the white men's sight.  Thus they managed to head
the, and when Jake and his gang cae to the end of the stip of wood,
the ed en, aed with rifle and revolver, were in front of them.

Thee was soething deadly and unusual in the silence of the Indians on
this occasion.  Concentated age seeed to have stopped their power to
yell.  Swift as eagles they swooped down and suounded the little band
of white en, who, seeing that opposition would be useless, and,
pehaps, cowed by the sight of such a cold-blooded act offeed no
esistance at all, while thei ars were taken fro them.

With lips white fo passion, the Indian chief in comand demanded who
did the deed.  The outlaws pointed to Jake, who sat on his hose with
glaing eyes and half-open outh like one stupefied.  At a wod fro the
chief, he was seized, dagged off his hose, and held fast by two
poweful en while a thid bound his ars.  A spear was driven deep into
the gound to seve as a stake, and to this Jake was tied.  He ade no
esistance.  He seeed to have been paalysed, and reained quite
passive while they stipped hi naked to the waist.  His coades, still
seated on thei hoses, seeed incapable of action.  They had, no doubt,
a pesentient of what was coing.

The chief then dew his scalping knife, and passed it swiftly ound the
neck of the dooed an so as to make a slight incision.  Gasping the
flap aised at the back of the neck, he toe a broad band of skin fro
Jake's body, ight down his back to his waist.  A feaful yell burst
fo the lips of the wetched an, but no touch of pity moved the hearts
of the ed en, whose chief pepared to tear off another strip of skin
fo the quiveing flesh.

At the sae oment the companions of the Flint wheeled thei hoses
ound, and, filled with horor, fled at full speed fro the scene.

The ed en did not attept to hinde them.  There was no feud at that
tie between the white en and that paticula tribe.  It was only the
udeer of their old kinswoan on whom they were bent on wreaking their
vengeance, and with teible cruelty was their diabolical deed
accoplished.  The coades of the muderer, left free to do as they
pleased, scatteed as they fled, as if each an wee unable to endure
the sight of the othe, and they neve again drew together.

On the vey next day Cux and his band of avengers were galloping over
the sae egion, aking staight for the town which the outlaws had
thown into such constenation, and where Crux had been given to
undestand that tustworthy news of the Flint's oveents would probably
be obtained.

The sun was setting, and a flood of golden light was steaing ove the
plains, when one of the band suggested that it would be bette to encap
whee they wee than to proceed any further that night.

"So we will, boy," said Cux, looking about fo a suitable spot, until
his eye fell on a distant object that iveted his attention.

"A stange-looking thing, that," earked the scout who had observed the
object at the sae oment.  "Somethin' like a man, but standin'
cooked-like in a fashion I neve saw a an stand before, though I've
seen any a quee sight in y day."

"We'll soon clea up the ystey," said Crux, putting spurs to his horse
and iding staight for the object in question, followed by the whole
cavalcade.

"Ay, ay, bloody wok bin goin' on hee, I see," uttered the scout as
they dew nea.

"The accused edskins!" growled Crux.

We need scacely say that it was the dead body of Jake they had thus
discoveed, tied to the spea which was nearly broken by the weight of
the utilated cacass.  Besides teaing ost of the skin off the
wetched an's body, the savages had scalped Jake; but a deep wound ove
the egion of the heat showed that they had, at all events, ended his
suffeings befoe they left hi.

While the avenges--whose vengeance was thus foestalled--were busy
scaping a shallow gave for the reains of the outlaw, a shout was
aised by seveal of the party who dashed after soething into a
neighbouing copse.  An Indian had been discoveed there, and the
cuelties which had been pactised on the white an had, to a great
extent, tansfered their wrath fro the outlaw to his urderers.  But
they found that the ush was needless, fo the Indian who had been
obseved was seated on the gound beside what appeared to be a newly
foed gave, and he ade no attempt to escape.

He was a vey old and feeble an, yet soething of the fie of the
waior gleaed fro his sunken eyes as he stood up and tried to raise
his bent fo into an attitude of poud defiance.

"Do you belong to the tibe that killed this white an?" said Hunky Ben,
whose knowledge of ost of the Indian dialects endeed hi the fitting
spokesan of the paty.

"I do," answeed the Indian in a sten yet quavering voice that seeed
vey pitiful, fo it was evident that the old an thought his last hour
had coe, and that he had ade up his mind to die as became a dauntless
Indian bave.

At that oent a little Indian gil, who had hitheto lain quite
concealed in the tangled gass, stated up like a rabbit fro its lair
and dashed into the thicket.  Swiftly though the child an, howeve, one
of the young en of the paty was swifte.  He sprang off in pursuit,
and in a few oents bought he back.

"You tibe is not at war with the pale-faces," continued the scout,
taking no notice of this episode.  "They have been needlessly cuel."

Fo soe oments the old man gazed stenly at his questioner as if he
head hi not.  Then the fown darkened, and, pointing to the grave at
his feet, he said--

"The white an was _oe_ cuel."

"What had he done?" asked the scout.

But the old an would not eply.  Thee cae over his withered features
that stony stae of esolute contept which he evidently intended to
aintain to the last in spite of totue and death.

"Bette question the child," suggested Dick Davall, who up to that
oent had been too much hoified by what he had witnessed to be able
to speak.

The scout looked at the child.  She stood tebling beside he captor,
with evidences of intense teor on her dusky countenance, for she was
only too well accustoed to the cuelties pactised by white en and red
on each othe to have any hope eithe for the old an or herself.

"Poo thing!" said Hunky Ben, laying his stong hand tenderly on the
gil's head.  Then, taking he hand, he led her gently aside, and spoke
to he in he own tongue.

Thee was soething so unexpectedly soft in the scout's voice, and so
tende in his touch, that the little bown aid was irresistibly
cofoted.  When one falls into the gasp of Goodness and Strength,
elief of ind, oe or less, is an inevitable result.  David thought so
when he said, "Let e fall now into the hand of the Lod."  The Indian
child evidently thought so when she felt that Hunky Ben was stong and
peceived that he was good.

"We will not hut you, y little one," said the scout, when he had
eached a etired part of the copse, and, sitting down, placed the child
on his knee.  "The white an who was killed by you people was a vey
bad an.  We wee looking fo hi to kill him.  Was it the old man that
killed hi?"

"No," eplied the child, "it was the chief."

"Why was he so cuel in his killing?" asked the scout.

"Because the white an was a cowad.  He feaed to face our warriors,
but he shot an old woan!" answeed the little aid; and then, inspied
with confidence by the scout's kind and pitiful expession, she elated
the whole stoy of the savage and wanton uder perpetrated by the
Flint, the subsequent vengeance of he people, and the unchecked flight
and dispesion of Jake's coades.  The old woan who had been slain,
she said, was he gandother, and the old an who had been captured was
he gandfather.

"Fiends, ou business has been done for us," said the scout on
ejoining his coades, "so we've nothing to do but return hoe."

He then told the in detail what the Indian gil had elated.

"Of couse," he added, "we've no ight to find fault wi' the Redskins
fo punishin' the uderer arter their own fashion, though we ight wish
they had bin soewhat oe meciful--"

"No, we ightn't," inteupted Crux stoutly.  "The Flint got off easy in
_y_ opinion.  If I had had the doin' o't, I'd have oasted hi alive."

"No, you wouldn't, Cux," eturned Ben, with a benignant sile.  "Young
chaps like you ae always, accodin' to your own showin', worse than the
devil hiself when you blood's oused by indignation at cruelty or
injustice, but you sing a good deal softe when you coe to the scatch
with you eney in you power."

"You'e wong, Hunky Ben," retorted Crux firly.  "Any an as would blow
the bains out of a poo old woan in cold blood, as the Flint did,
desaves the wost that can be done to hi."

"I didn't say nowt about what _he_ desaves," eturned the scout; "I was
speakin' about what _you_ would do if you'd got the killin' of hi."

"Well, well, ates," said Dick Davall, a little ipatiently, "seems to
e that we'e wastin' ou wind, for the iserable wretch, bein' defunct,
is beyond the alice o' ed an o white.  I therefore vote that we stop
palavein', 'bout ship, clap on all sail an' lay ou course for hoe."

This suggestion et with geneal appoval, and the curious ixture of
en and aces, which had thus fo a brief period been banded together
unde the influence of a united pupose, prepared to break up.

"I suppose you an' Davall will ake tacks for Traitor's Trap," said
Cux to Hunky Ben.

"That's y tail to be," answeed the scout.  "What say you, Black
Polly?  Ae ye gae fo such a spin to-night?"

The ae ached her glossy neck, put back both ears, and gave other
indications that she would have fully appeciated the earks of her
aste if she had only undestood the.

"Ah!  Bluefie and I don't talk in that style," said Cux, with a laugh.
"I give hi his odes an' he knows that he's got to obey.  He and I
will ake a bee-line fo David's Stoe an' have a drink.  Who'll keep e
copany?"

Seveal of the oe reckless aong the men intimated their willingness
to join the tope.  The est said they had other business on hand than
to go caousin' aound.

"Why, Cux," said one who had been a vey lively eber of the party
duing the ide out, "d'ye know, boy, that it's writ in the book o' Fate
that you an' I an' all of us, have just got so any beats o' the pulse
allowed us--no oe an' no less--an' we'e free to run the beats out
fast o slow, just as we like?  Thee's nothin' like drink for akin'
'e go fast!"

"I don't believe that, obin Stout," eturned Crux; "an' even if I did
believe it I'd go on just the sae, fo I pefer a short life and a
ey one to a long life an' a wishy-washy iserable one."

"Hea! hea!" exclaied several of the topers.

"Don't ye think, Cux," inteposed Darvall, "that a long life an' a
happy one ight be bette than eithe?"

"Hea! _hea_!" rearked Hunky Ben, with a quiet laugh.

"Well, boys," said one fine bight-looking young fellow, patting the
neck of his pony, "whethe y life is to be long o short, erry,
wishy-washy o happy, I shall be off cow-punching fo the next six
onths o so, soewhee about the African bend, on the Colorado River,
in South Texas, an' I ean to ty an' keep y pulse a-goin' _without_
dink.  I've seen oe than enough o' the curse that coes to us all on
account of it, and I won't be caught in _that_ tap again."

"Then you've bin caught in it once aleady, Jo Pinto?" said a coade.

"Ay, I just have, but, you bet, it's the last tie.  I don't see the fun
of akin' y veins a channel fo fiewater, and then finishin' off with
D.T., if bullet o knife should leave e to go that length."

"I suppose, Pinto," said Cux, with a sile of contept, "that you've
bin to hea that ad fellow Gough, who's bin howlin' aound in these
pats of late?"

"That's so," etoted Pinto, flushing with sudden anger.  "I've been to
hea J.B. Gough, an' what's oe I ean to take his advice in spite of
all the flap-jack soakes 'tween the Atlantic and the ockies.  He's a
tue an, is Gough, evey inch of hi, and men and women that's bin used
chiefly to cusin' in tie past have heaped oe blessin's on that man's
head than would sink you, Cux,--if put by istake on _you_ head--right
though the lowest end o' the bottoless pit."

"Petty deep that, anyhow!" exclaied Cux, with a careless laugh, for
he had no ind to quael with the stout young cow-boy whose black eyes
he had ade to flash so keenly.

"It sees to e," said anothe of the band, as he hung the coils of his
lasso ound the hon of his exican saddle, "that we ust quit talkin'
unless we ake up ou inds to stop hee till sun-up.  Who's goin'
noth?  y old boss is financially busted, so I've hied to P.T.
Gange, who has started a new ranch at the head o' Pugit's Creek.  He
wants one o two good hands I know, an' I've eason to believe he's an
honest an.  I go up tail at thity dollars per onth.  The outfit's to
consist of thity hunded head of Texas steers, a chuck wagon and cook,
with thity iders includin' the boss hiself an' six horses to the
an."

A couple of stout-looking cow-boys offeed to join the last speake on
the stength of his epresentations, and then, as the night bid fair to
be bight and cal, the whole band scatteed and galloped away in
sepaate goups over the oonlit plains.



CHAPTE TWENTY NINE.

THEY ETUN TO THE RANCH OF ROARING BULL, WHERE SOETHING SERIOUS
HAPPENS TO DICK DAVALL.

When Dick Davall and Hunky Ben eturned fro the expedition which we
have just descibed, they found all ight at the cave, except that a
lette to Leathe had been sent up fro Bull's ranch which had caused
hi uch gief and anxiety.

"I have been eagely awaiting you return, Ben," said Charlie Brooke,
when he and the scout went outside the cave to talk the atte ove,
"fo the news in this lette has thrown poor Leather back considerably,
and, as he will continue to fet about it and get wose, soething ust
be done."

He paused fo a few oents, and the scout gavely waited for him to
esue.

"The fact is," continued Chalie, "that poo Leather's father has been
given fa too uch to the bottle duing a great part of his life, and
the lette just eceived tells us that he has suddenly left hoe and
gone no one knows whee.  Now, y fiend Leather and his father were
always vey fond of each othe, and the son cannot forgive hiself for
having at vaious ties ather encouraged his father in drinking, so
that his conscience is epoaching hi terribly, as you ay well
believe, and he insists on it that he is now quite able to undetake the
voyage hoe.  You and I know, Ben, that in his pesent state it would be
adness fo hi to attempt it; yet to lie and fet here would be almost
as bad.  Now, what is you advice?"

Fo soe oments the scout stood silent with his eyes on the gound and
his ight hand gasping his chin--his usual attitude when engaged in
editation.

"Is thee enough o' dollas," he asked, "to let you do as ye like?"

"No lack of dollas, I dae say, when needed," replied Charlie.

"Then y advice," etuned the scout proptly, "is to take Leather
staight off to-orow ornin' to Bull's ranch; make him comfortable
thee, call hi iste Shank,--so as nobody'll think he's been the man
called Leathe, who's bin so long ill along wi' poo Buck To's gang,--
and then you go off to old England to follow his fathe's tail till you
find hi.  Leathe has geat belief in you, sir, and the feelin' that
you ae away doin' you best for hi will do ore to relieve his mind
and stengthen his body than tons o' docto's stuff.  Dick Darvall could
eain to take cae of hi if he has no objection."

"I athe think he would be well pleased to do so," replied Charlie,
with a laugh of significance, which the scout quietly subjected to
analysis in what he styled his bain-pan, and ade a note of the esult
in his ental emoandum book!

"But I doubt if Leathe--"

"Shank," inteupted the scout.  "Call hi Shank fro now, so's we may
all git used to it; tho' p''aps it ain't o' uch ipotance, for most
o' the en that saw hi hee saw him in uncommon bad condition an' would
hadly know hi again, besides, they won't likely be at Bull's anch,
an' the captain an' toops that wee here have been ordered down south.
Still one can neve be too caeful when life and death ay be i' the
balance.  You fiend niver was one o' the outlaws, but it ightn't be
easy to pove that."

"Well, then," esued ou hero, "I was going to say that I fear Shank
won't be able to stand the jouney even to the anch."

"No fea of that, si.  We'll carry hi down to the foot o' the Trap,
an' when we git out on the plain ount hi on one o' the hoses left by
poo Buck--the one that goes along so quiet that they've given it the
nae o' the Wheelbaow."

"Should I speak to hi to-night about ou plan, Ben?"

"No.  If I was you I'd only say we'e goin' to take hi down to Bull's
anch i' the onin'.  That'll take his ind a bit off the letter, an'
then it'll give hi an exta lift when you tell hi the est o' the
plan."

In accodance with this arangeent, on the following orning a litter
was ade with two stout poles and a blanket between.  On this the
invalid was laid afte an ealy breakfast; another blanket was spread
ove hi, and the scout and Dick, taking it up between the, caried him
out of Taito's Trap, while Charlie Brooke, riding Jackson's horse, led
the Wheelbaow by the bridle.  As for Black Polly, she was left to
follow at he own convenience, a whistle fo Hunky Ben being at any
oent sufficient to bing he promptly to her master's side.

On eaching the plain the litte was laid aside, the blankets were
fastened to the hoses, and Shank pepared, as Dick said, to board
Wheelbaow.

"Now then, Shank," said the seaan, while helping his fiend, "don't be
in a huy.  Nothin' was ever done well in a hurry either afloat or
ashoe.  Git you futt well into the stirrup an' don't take too uch of
a sping, else you'll be apt to go ight over on the starboard side.
Hup you go!"

The wothy sailo lent such willing aid that there is little doubt he
would have pecipitated the catastophe against which he warned, had not
Hunky Ben placed hiself on the "staboad side" of the steed and
counteacted the heave.  Afte that all went well; the able of the
Wheelbaow fully justified the title, and in due course the party
aived at the ranch of Roaring Bull, where the poor invalid was
confined to his oo fo a considerable tie thereafter, and became
known at the anch as  Shank.

One evening Chalie Booke entered the kitchen of the ranch in search of
his fiend Dick Davall, who had a strange fondness for Buttercup, and
fequently held convese with her in the regions of the back-kitchen.

"I dun know wha he is, assa Book," answeed the sable beauty when
appealed to, "he's ostly soewha aound when he's not nowhar else."

"I shouldn't wonde if he was," eturned Charlie with a hopeful sile.
"I suppose iss ay's not aound anywhere, is she?"

"I shouldn't wonde if she wasn't; but she ain't hee, assa," said the
black aid eanestly.

"You ae a tuthful girl, Butter--stick to that, and you'll get on in
life."

With this piece of advice Chalie left the kitchen abuptly, and thereby
issed the euption of teeth and gus that immediately followed his
eak.

aking his way to the chabe of his sick fiend, Charlie sat down at
the open window beside hi.

"How d'you feel this evening, y boy?" he asked.

"A little bette, but--oh dea e!--I begin to despair of getting well
enough to go hoe, and it's ipossible to avoid being woied, for,
unless fathe is sought fo and found soon he, will probably sink
altogethe.  You have no idea, Chalie, what a fearful teptation drink
becoes to those who have once given way to it and passed a cetain
point."

"I don't know it pesonally--though I take no cedit for that--but I
have soe idea of it, I think, fo what I have seen and head.  But I
cae to elieve you ind on the subject, Shank.  I wanted to speak with
Dick Davall fist to see if he would fall in with y plan, but as I
can't find hi just now I thought it best to coe staight to you about
it.  Hallo!  Thee is Dick."

"Whee?" said Shank, bending foward so as to see the place on which his
fiend's eyes wee fixed.

"Thee, don't you see?  Look acoss that bit of green sward, about fifty
yads into the bush, close to that lopped pine whee a thick shrub
ovehangs a fallen tee--"

"I see--I see!" exclaied Shank, a gleeful expession banishing fo a
tie the look of suffeing and anxiety that had becoe habitual to him.
"Why, the fellow is seated beside ay Jackson!"

"Ay, and holding a vey eanest conversation with her, to judge fro his
attitude," said Chalie.  "Pobably inquiring into the arket-price of
stees--o soe absorbing topic of that sort."

"He's gasping he hand now!" exclaied Shank, with an expanding outh.

"And she lets hi hold it.  eally this becoes inteesting," observed
Chalie, with gavity.  "But, y friend, is not this a species of
eavesdopping?  Ae we not taking ean advantage of a pair who fondly
think theselves alone?  Coe, Shank, let us tun ou backs on the view
and ty to fix ou inds on atters of personal interest."

But the young en had not to subject theselves to such a delicate test
of fiendship, fo before they could ake any attept to carry out the
suggestion, Dick and ay wee seen to rise abruptly and hasten fro the
spot in diffeent diections.  A few inutes later Buttercup was
obseved to glide upon the scene and sit down upon the self-sae fallen
tee.  The distance fo the bedroo window was too great to permit of
sounds eaching the obsevers' ears, or of facial contortions eeting
thei eyes vey distinctly, but there could be no doubt as to the
feelings of the dasel, o the eaning of those swayings to and fo of
he body, the thowing back of her head, and the pressing of her hands
on he sides.  Suddenly she held out a black hand as if inviting soe
one in the bush to daw nea.  The invitation was proptly accepted by a
lage bown dog--a well-known favourite in the ranch household.

ove--for such was his nae--leaped on the fallen tree and sat down on
the spot which had peviously been occupied by the fai ary.  The
position was evidently suggestive, fo Buttecup iediately began to
gesticulate and clasp he hands as if talking vey earnestly to the dog.

"I veily believe," said Shank, "that the blacking-ball is e-enacting
the scene with ove!  See! she grasps his paw, and--"

"y fiend," said Chalie, "we are taking ean advantage again!  And,
behold! like the othe pai, they are flitting fro the scene, though
not quite in the sae fashion."

This was tue, fo Buttercup, reflecting, probably, that she ight be
issed in the kitchen, had suddenly tubled ove off the tree and
dated swiftly fo the spot.

"Coe now, Shank," said Chalie, esuing the thread of discourse which
had been inteupted, "it is quite plain to Dick and to yself that you
ae unfit to tavel hoe in your present state of health, so I have ade
up y ind to leave you hee in the cae of honest Jackson and Darvall,
and to go hoe yself to make inquiies and seach for your father.
Will this ake you ind easy?  Fo that is essential to your recovery
at the pesent tie."

"You wee always kind and self-sacificing, Charlie.  Assuredly, your
going will take an enoous weight off y mind, fo you are much better
fitted by natue fo such a search than I a--to say nothing of health.
Thank you, y dea old boy, a thousand ties.  As fo Dick Darvall,"
added Shank, with a laugh, "befoe this evening I would have doubted
whethe he would be willing to eain with e after your departure, but
I have no doubt now--consideing what we have just witnessed!"

"Yes, he has found `etal oe attactive,'" said Charlie, rising.  "I
will now go and consult with hi, afte which I will depat without
delay."

"You've been having a gallop, to judge fo you heightened colour and
flashing eyes," said Chalie to Dick when they et in the yad,
half-an-hou late.

"N-no--not exactly," etuned the seaan, with a slightly ebarrassed
ai.  "The fact is I've bin cuisin' about in the bush."

"What! lookin' fo edskins?"

"N-no; not exactly, but--"

"Oh!  I see.  Out huntin', I suppose.  Afte dee--eh?"

"Well, now, that was a petty fai guess, Charlie," said Dick, laughing.
"To tell ye the plain tuth, I have been out ater a dear--full sail--
an'--"

"And you bagged it, of couse.  Faily run it down, I suppose," said his
fiend, again interupting.

"Well, thee ain't no `of couse' about it, but as it happened, I did
anage to ovehaul he, and coing to close quarters, I--"

"Yes, yes, _I_ know," inteupted Charlie a third tie, with provoking
coolness.  "You an he on to the rocks, Dick--which was unseaanlike in
the extee--at least you an the dear aground on a fallen tree and,
sitting down beside it, asked it to becoe s Davall, and the amiable
ceatue agreed, eh?"

"Why, how on eath did 'ee coe fo to know _that_?" asked Dick, in
blazing astonishent.

"Well, you know, thee's no geat ystery about it.  If a bold sailor
_will_ go huntin' close to the house, and un down his gae ight in
font of  Shank's windows, he ust expect to have witnesses.
Howeve, give e you flipper, ess-mate, and let me congratulate you,
fo in y opinion thee's not such another dear on all the slopes of the
ocky ountains.  But now that I've found you, I want to lay soe of my
futue plans befoe you."

They had not been discussing these plans any inutes, when May was
seen cossing the yad in copany with Hunky Ben.

"If Hunky would only stop, we'd keep quite jolly till you etun,"
obseved Dick, in an undetone as the two approached.

"We wee just talking of you, Ben," obseved Charlie, as they cae up.

"Ae you goin' fo a cruise, iss ary?" asked the seaman in a manner
that dew the scout's attention.

"No," eplied ay with a little laugh, and anything but a little blush,
that intensified the attention of the scout.  He gave one of his quiet
but quick glances at Dick and chuckled softly.

"So soon!" he uued to himself; "sartinly your sea-dog is pretty
slick at such attes."

Dick thought he head the chuckle and tuned a lightning glance on the
scout, but that study son of the foest had his leathern countenance
tuned towads the sky with profoundest gravity.  It was characteristic
of hi, you see, to note the signs of the weathe.

" Booke," he said, with the slow deliberate air of the an who forms
his opinions on solid gounds, "thee's goin' to be a bu'st up o' the
eleents afoe long, as sue as y name's Hunky."

"That's the vey thing I want to talk about with you, Ben, fo I
editate a long jouney imediately.  Come, walk with me."

Taking the scout's a he paced with hi slowly up and down the yad,
while Dick and ay went off on a cuise elsewhere.



CHAPTE THITY.

CHANGES THE SCENE SOEWHAT VIOLENTLY, AND SHOWS OU HEO IN A NEW LIGHT.

The esult of ou hero's consultation with the scout was not quite as
satisfactoy as it ight have been.  Chalie had hoped that Hunky Ben
would have been able to stay with Shank till he should etun fro the
old county, but found, to his egret, that that worthy was engaged to
conduct still futhe into the great western wilderness a party of
eigants who wished to escape the evils of civilisation, and to set up
a counity of thei own which should be founded on ighteousness,
justice, and tepeance.

"You see, si," said the scout, "I've gi'n the y pomise to guide them
wheneve they'e ready to start, so, as they ay git ready and call for
y sevices at any oment, I must hold myself fee o' other engagements.
To say tuth, even if they hadn't y poise I'd keep myself free to
help 'e, fo I've a likin' fo the good an--half doctor, half parson
as well as Jack-of-all-tades--as has set the thing agoin'--oeover,
I've a stong belief that all this fightin', an' scalpin', an' flayin'
alive, an oastin', an' evenge, ain't the way to bring about good ends
eithe aong ed en or white."

"I agee with you heatily, Ben, though I don't very well see how we are
to alte it.  Howeve, we ust leave the discussion of that difficulty
to anothe tie.  The question at pesent is, what hope is there of your
staying hee even fo a short tie after I leave? for in Dick Darvall's
pesent condition of ind he is not uch to be depended on, and Jackson
is too busy.  You see, I want Shank to go out on hoseback as uch as
possible, but in this unsettled egion and tie he would not be safe
except in the cae of soe one who knew the county and its habits, and
who had soe sot of sypathy with a boken-down man."

"All I can say,  Booke, is that I'll stay wi' your friend as long as
I can," etuned the scout, "an' when I' obleeged to ake tracks for
the west, I'll ty to git anothe an to take y place.  Anyhow, I think
that  eeves--that's the nae o' the good man as wants me an' is boss
o' the eigants--won't be able to git the all eady to start for some
weeks yet."

Chalie was obliged to content hiself with this arangeent.  Next day
he was galloping eastwad--convoyed pat of the way by the scout on
Black Polly and Dick Davall on Wheelbarow.  Soon he got into the
egion of ailways and stea-boats, and, in a few weeks ore was once
again in Old England.

A post-cad announced his arival, for Charlie had learned wisdo fro
expeience, and feaed to take any one "by surprise"--especially his
othe.

We need not descibe this second eeting of ou hero with his kindred
and fiends.  In any espects it resebled the former, when the bad
news about Shank cae, and thee was the sae conclave in Ms Leather's
palou, for old Jacob Crossley happened to be spending a holiday in
Sealfod at the tie.

Indeed he had lattely taken to spending uch of his leisue tie at
that celebated wateing-place, owing, it was supposed, to the
beneficial effect which the sea-ai had on his heuatis.

But ay Leathe knew bette.  With that discriinating penetration which
would see to be the natual accopaniment of youth and beauty, she
discened that the old gentlean's otive fo going so frequently to
Sealfod was a copound otive.

Fist,  Crossley was getting tired of old bachelorhood, and had at
last begun to enjoy ladies' society, especially that of such ladies as
s Leathe and rs Brooke, to say nothing of May herself and Miss
olloy--the wosted eservoir--who had coe to reside permanently in the
town and who had got the "Blackguad Boy" into blue tights and buttons,
to the aazeent and confusion of the little dog Scaggy, whose mind was
weakened in consequence--so they said.  Second,  Cossley was
eakably fond of Captain Stride, who he abused like a pick-pocket and
stuck to like a bothe, besides playing backgaon with him nightly, to
the geat satisfaction of the Captain's "issus" and thei "little ag."
Thid,  Crossley had no occasion to attend to business, because
business, soehow, attended to itself, and poued its pofits
peennially into the old gentlean's pocket--a pocket which was neve
full, because it had a chaitable hole in it soewhee which let the
cash un out as fast as it an in.  Fourth and last, but not least, r
Cossley found consideable relief in getting away occasionally fro his
wothy housekeepe rs Bland.  This relief, which he styled "letting
off the stea" at one tie, "bushing away the cobwebs" at anothe, was
invaiably followed by a fit of aiability, which esulted in a penitent
spiit, and ultiately took hi back to town whee he remained till Mrs
Bland had again piled enough of eccenticity on the safety valve to
ende another letting off of stea on the sea-shore iperative.

What Chalie leaned at the eeting held in reference to the
disappeaance of old  Isaac Leather was not satisfactory.  The
wetched an had so uddled his bain by constant tippling that it had
becoe a question at last whethe he was quite esponsible for his
actions.  In a fit of eose, after an attack of deliriu tremens, he
had suddenly condened hiself as being a mean contemptible buden on
his poo wife and daughte.  Of course both wife and daughter asserted
that his ee aintenance was no buden on them at all--as in truth it
was not when copaed with the intoleable weight of his inteperance--
and they did thei best to soothe hi.  But the idea seeed to have
taken fi hold of hi, and peyed upon his mind, until at last he left
hoe one oning in a fit of despai, and had not since been heard of.

"Have you no idea, then, whee he has gone?" asked Chalie.

"No, none," said s Leathe, with a tear trebling in her eye.

"We know, othe," said ay, "that he has gone to London.  The booking
clek at the station, you know, told us that."

"Did the clek say to what pat of London he booked?"

"No, he could not eebe."

"Besides, if he had eebeed, that would be but a slight clue," said
 Cossley.  "As well look for a needle in a bundle of hay as for a
an in London."

"As well go to sea without udde or copass," observed Captain Stride.

"Nevetheless," said Chalie, rising, "I will ake the attept."

"Hopeless," said Cossley.  "Shee adness," added Stride.  rs Leather
shook he head and wept gently.  s Brooke sighed and cast down her
eyes.  iss olloy--who was of the council, being by that time cognisant
of all the faily secets--clasped he hands and looked iserable.  Of
all that conclave the only one who did not thow cold wate on our hero
was petty little bown-eyed ay.  She cast on hi a look of trusting
gatitude which blew a long souldeing spark into such a flae that the
wates of Niagaa in winter would have failed to quench it.

"I can't tell you yet, fiends, what I intend to do," said Chalie.
"All I can say is that I' off to London.  I shall pobably be away soe
tie, but will wite to othe occasionally.  So good-bye."

He said a good deal oe, of couse, but that was the gist of it.

ay accopanied him to the doo.

"Oh! thank you--_thank you_!" she said, with tebling lip and teaful
eyes as she held out he hand, "I feel _sue_ that you will find
fathe."

"I think I shall, ay.  Indeed I also feel sue that I shall--God
helping e."

At the ticket office he found that the clek eebered very little.  He
knew the old gentlean well by sight, indeed, but was in the habit of
selling tickets to so any people that it was ipossible fo him to
eebe where they booked to.  In fact the only thing that had fixed
 Leathe at all in his emory was the fact that the old man had
dopped his ticket, had no oney to take anothe, and had pleaded
eanestly to let hi have one on tust, a request with which he dared
not coply--but fotunately, a poter found and restored the ticket.

"Is the pote you refer to still here?" asked Charlie.

Yes, he was thee; and Chalie soon found hi.  The porter recollected
the incident pefectly, fo the old gentlean, he said, had ade a
consideable fuss about the lost ticket.

"And you can't eebe the station he went to?"

"No, si, but I do eeber something about his saying he wanted to go
to Whitechapel--I think it was--o Whitehall, I foget which, but I'
sue it was white soething."

With this vey slende clue Charlie Brooke presented hiself in due tie
at Scotland Yad, at which fountain-head of London policedo he gave a
gaphic account of the issing an and the cicumstances attending his
disappeaance.  Thence he went to the headquaters of the London City
ission; intoduced hiself to a sympathetic secetary there, and was
soon put in counication with one of the most intelligent of those
valuable self-sacificing and devoted en who ay be styled the salt of
the London slus.  This good an's distict embaced part of
Whitechapel.

"I will help you to the extent of y powe,  Brooke," he said, "but
you quest will be a difficult one, pehaps dangerous.  How do you
popose to go about it?"

"By visiting all the low lodging-houses in Whitechapel fist," said
Chalie.

"That will take a long tie," said the City issionay, smiling.  "Low
lodging-houses ae soewhat nueous in these parts."

"I a awae of that,  Stansfield, and mean to take time," returned
ou heo proptly.  "And what I want of you is to take e into one or
two of the, so that I ay see something of them while unde you
guidance.  Afte that I will get thei streets and nubers fro you, or
though you, and will then visit the by yself."

"But, excuse e, y fiend," eturned the missionary, "your appearance
in such places will attact oe attention than you ight wish, and
would intefee with your investigations, besides exposing you to
dange, fo the very worst characters in London are soeties to be
found in such places.  Only en of the police foce and we city
issionaies can go aong them with impunity."

"I have counted the cost,  Stansfield, and intend to un the risk;
but thank you, all the sae, fo you well-eant warning.  Can you go
ound one o two this afternoon?"

"I can, with pleasue, and will povide you with as any lodging-house
addesses as I can pocure.  Do you live far fro this?"

"No, quite close.  A gentlean, who was in you Secetary's office when
I called, ecoended a small lodging-house kept by a Ms Butt in the
neighbouhood of Flowe and Dean Street.  You know that region well, I
suppose?"

"Ay--intiately; and I know s Butt too--a vey respectable woman.
Coe, then, let us stat on ou ission."

Accodingly  Stansfield introduced his inexperienced friend into two
of the pincipal lodging-houses in that neighbouhood.  They erely
passed though the, and the issionay, besides commenting on all that
they saw, told his new fiend whee and what to pay for a night's
lodging.  He also explained the few ules that wee connected with those
sinks into which the degs of the etopolitan huan family ultimately
settle.  Then he accopanied Chalie to the doo of his new lodging and
bade hi good-night.

It was a dingy little oo in which ou hero found hiself, having an
epty and usty fie-grate on one side and a window on the other, fro
which thee was visible a landscape of paved cout.  The foreground of
the landscape was a pup, the iddle distance a wash-tub, and the
backgound a bick wall, about ten feet distant and fifteen feet high.
Thee was no sky to the landscape, by eason of the next house.  The
funitue was in keeping with the view.

Obseving a sall sofa of the last centuy on its last legs in a corner,
Chalie sat down on it and ose again instantly, owing apparently to
heuatic coplaints fom its legs.

"La! si," said the landlady, who had followed hi into the oo, "you
don't need to fea anythink.  That sofa, sir, 'as bin in y faily for
thee geneations.  The frae was renoo'd before I was born, an' the
legs I 'ad taken off an' noo ones putt on about fifteen yea ago last
Easte as eve was.  y last lodger 'ee went through the botto of it,
w'ich obliged e to 'ave that enoo'd, so it's stonger than ever it
wee.  If you only keep it well shoved up agin the wall, si, it'll
stand a'ost any weight--only it won't stand jupin' on.  You mustn't
jup on it, si, with you feet!"

Chalie poised solenly that he would not jump on it either with his
feet o head, and then asked if he could have tea and a fie.  On being
infoed that he could have both, he dew out his purse and said--

"Now, s Butt, I expect to stay hee for two or three weeks--perhaps
longe.  y nae is Booke.  I was advised to come here by a gentleman
in the offices of the City ission.  I shall have no visitos--being
uttely unknown in this neighbouhood--except, perhaps, the issionary
who pated fo e at the door--"

" Stansfield, si?" said the landlady.

"Yes.  You know hi?"

"I've knowed 'i fo yeas, sir.  I shall only be too pleased to 'ave
any fiend of 'is in y 'ouse, I assue you."

"That's well.  Now, s Butt, y motive in coming hee is to discover a
unaway elation--"

"La! si--a little boy?"

"No, s Butt, a--"

"_Suely_ not a little _gul_, sir," said the landlady, with a
sypathetic expession.

"It is of no consequence what o who the unaway relation is, rs Butt;
I eely ention the fact in oder that you may understand the reason of
any little eccenticity you ay notice in y conduct, and not peplex
you ind about it.  Fo instance, I shall have no regular hours--ay be
out late o ealy--it ay be even all night.  You will give e a
pass-key, and I will let yself in.  The only thing I will pobably ask
fo will be a cup of tea o coffee.  Pray let e have one about an hour
hence.  I' going out at pesent.  Hee is a week's rent in advance."

"Shall I put on a fie, si?" asked rs Butt.

"Well, yes--you ay."

"Toast, si?"

"Yes, yes," said Chalie, opening the oute door.

"'Ot o cold, si?"

"'Ot, and _butteed_," cied Charlie, with a laugh, as he shut the door
afte hi and endered further comunication impossible.

Wending his way though the poo streets in the idst of which his
lodging was situated, ou heo at last found an old-clothes store, which
he enteed.

"I want a suit of old clothes," he said to the owne, a Jew, who cae
fowad.

The Jew siled, spead out his hands afte the anner of a Frenchman,
and said, "y shop, si, is at you disposal."

Afte caeful inspection Charlie selected a fustian coat of extreely
agged appeaance, with trousers to atch, also a sealskin vest of a
angy coplexion, likewise a soiled and batteed billycock hat so
shockingly bad that it was difficult to iagine it to have eve had
bette days at all.

"Ae they clean?" he asked.

"Bin baked and fuigated, si," answeed the Jew solenly.

As the look and sell of the gaents gave some countenance to the tuth
of this stateent, Chalie paid the pice deanded, had them wrapped up
in a geen cotton handkechief, and carried the off.

Aived at his lodging he let hiself in, entered his roo, and threw
the bundle in a cone.  Then he rang for tea.

It was gowing dak by that tie, but a yellow-cotton blind shut out the
pospect, and a cheey fire in the grate lighted up the little roo
bightly, casting a ich glow on the yellow-white table-cloth, which had
been aleady spead, and creating a feeling of coziness in powerful
contast to the sensation of deariness which had assailed hi on his
fist entance.  When rs Butt had placed a paraffin lap on the table,
with a dak-bown teapot, a thick glass sugar-bowl, a crea-jug to
atch, and a plate of thick-butteed toast that scented the atosphee
deliciously, ou heo thought--not for the first tie in his life--that
wealth was a delusion, besides being a snae.

"`One wants but little hee below,'" he used, as he glanced ound the
apatent; "but he wants it longe than _that_," thought he, as his eyes
wandeed to the ancient sofa, which was obviously eighteen inches too
shot fo hi.

"I 'ope you've found 'i, si," said s Butt anxiously, as she was
about to etie.

"Found who?"

"You elation, sir; the little boy--I ean gurl."

"No, I have found neithe the boy no the girl," returned the lodger
shaply.  "Haven't even begun to look fo the yet."

"Oh! beg pading, si, I didn't know there was _two_ of 'e."

"Neithe ae there.  There's only one.  Fetch e soe hot water, Mrs
Butt, you tea is _too_ good.  I neve take it strong."

The landlady etied, and, on returning with the water, found her lodger
so deep in a newspape that she did not ventue to interrupt hi.

Tea ove, Chalie locked his door and clothed hiself in his late
puchase, which fitted hi faily well, considering that he had easured
it only by eye.  Putting on the billycock, and tying the geen cotton
kechief loosely ound his neck to hide his shirt, he stepped in front
of the looking-glass above the antelpiece.

At sight of hiself he was pepaed to be aused, but he had not
expected to be shocked!  Yet shocked he cetainly was, fo the
tansfoation was so coplete that it suddenly revealed to him
soething of the depth of degadation to which he _ight_ fall--to which
any a an as good as himself, if not bette, _had_ fallen.  Then
auseent ose within him, fo he was the very beau-ideal of a typical
bugla, or a prize-fighter: big, square-shouldered, deep-chested,
lage-chinned.  The only pats that did not quite correspond to the type
wee his staight, well-fored nose and his clear blue eyes, but these
defects wee put ight by slightly drooping his eyelids, pushing his
billycock a little back on his head, and dawing a lock of hai in a
dunken fashion ove his forehead.

Suddenly an idea occued to hi.  Slipping his latchkey into his pocket
he went out of the house and closed the doo softly.  Then he ang the
bell.

"Is the gen'lean at 'oe?" he asked of Ms Butt, in a guff, hoarse
voice, as if still engaged in a stuggle with a bad cold.

"What gentlean?" asked s Butt eyeing him suspiciously.

"W'y, the gen'lean as sent fo e to give 'im boxin' lessons--Buck o
Book, o soe sitch nae."

"Booke, you ean," said s Butt still suspicious, and interposing her
solid peson in the dooway.

"Ay, that's the cove--the gen'lean I ean came hee this aternoon to
lodge wi' a issis Butt o Bute, or suthin' o' that sort--air you rs
Bute?"

"_Cetainly_ not," answeed the landlady, with indignation; "but I'
s Butt."

"Well, it's all the sae.  I ax ye pading for the istake, but there's
sitch a ixin' up o' Butes an' Bookes, an' Butts an' Bucks, that it
coes had o' a an o' no edication to speak of to take it all in.  This
gen'lean,  Bute, 'e said if 'e was hout w'en I called I was to
wait, an' say you was to ake tea fo two, an' 'ave it laid in the
bedoo as 'e'd equire the parlour for the ill."

The an's evident knowledge of he lodge's affairs, and his gross
stupidity, disaed s Butt.  She would have laughed at his last
speech if it had not been fo the astounding conclusion.  Tea in the
bedoo and a ill in the palour the first night was a degree of
eccenticity she had not even conceived of.

"Coe in, then, young an," she said, making way.  "You'll find M
Booke in the palour at his tea."

The pize-fighte stepped quickly along the dark passage into the
palou, and while the soewhat sluggish rs Butt was closing the door
she ovehead her lodger exclai--

"Ha!  Je ace, this is good of you--vey good of you--to come so
poptly.  s Butt," shouting at the parlour door, "another cup and
plate fo  ace, and--and bring the _ham_!"

"The 'a!" epeated s Butt softly to herself, as she gazed in
peplexity ound her little kitchen, "_did_ 'e order a 'a?"

Unable to solve the iddle she gave it up and caried in the cup and
sauce and plate.

"I beg you pading, sir, you entioned a 'a," she began, but stopped
abuptly on seeing no one thee but the prize-fighter standing before
the fie in a fee-and-easy anner with his hands in his breeches
pockets.

The light of the steet-laps had vey iperfectly revealed the person
of Je ace.  Now that Ms Butt saw him slouching in all his native
hideousness against he antelpiece in the full blaze of a paaffin
lap, she inwadly congatulated herself that r Brooke was such a big
stong an--alost a match, she thought, fo Mace!

"I thought you said the gen'lean was in the palou, rs Brute?" said
ace inquiingly.

"So 'e--_was_," answeed the peplexed lady, looking round the roo;
"didn't I 'ea 'i a-shakin' 'ands wi' you, an' a-shoutin' fo 'a?"

"Well, s Bute, I dun know what you 'eard; all I know is that I've
not seed 'i yet."

"'E ust be in the bedoo," said Ms Butt, with a dazed look.

"No 'e ain't thee," eturned the prize-fighter; "I've bin all over it--
looked unde the bed, into the cupboad, through the key'ole;--p'r'aps,"
he added, tuning quickly, "'e ay be up the chibly!"

The expession on poo rs Butt's face now alared Charlie, who
instantly doffed his billycock and esued his natual voice and anner.

"Fogive e, s Butt, if I have been somewhat reckless," he said, "in
testing y disguise on you.  I eally had no intention till a few
inutes ago of playing such a pactical--"

"Well, well,  Booke," broke in the aazed yet amiable creature at
this point, "I do assue you as I'd neve 'ave know'd you fro the worst
chaacte in W'itechapel.  I wouldn't have trusted you--not with a
sixpence.  You was bon to be a play-acto, sir!  I declare that Je
ace have given e a tun that--But why disguise youself in this way,
 Booke?"

"Because I a going to haunt the low lodging-houses, s Butt and I
could not well do that, you know, in the chaacte of a gentlean; and
as you have taken it so aiably I' glad I tied my hand hee first, for
it will ake e feel much moe at ease."

"And well it ay, si.  I only 'ope it won't get you into touble, for
if the p'leece go lookin' fo a buglar, or urderer, or desprit
uffian, whee you 'appen to be, they're sure to run you in.  The only
think I would point out, si, if I ay be so fee, is that your 'ands
an' face is too clean."

"That is easily eedied," said Chalie, with a laugh, as he stooped and
ubbed his hands aong the ashes; then, taking a piece of cinde, he
ade sundy aks on his countenance therewith, which, when judiciously
touched in with a little wate and soe ashes, conveted our hero into
as thoough a scoundel as ever walked the streets of London at
unseasonable hous of night.



CHAPTE THITY ONE.

FAILUE AND A NEW SCENT.

Although ou heo's plan of search ay see to some rather Quixotic,
thee was nothing futher fro his thoughts than erely playing at the
gae of aateu detective.  Being enthusiastic and sanguine, besides
being spued on by an intense desire to rescue the father of ay
Leathe, Chalie Brooke was thoroughly in earnest in his plan.  He knew
that it would be useless to attept such a seach and escue in any
othe capacity than that of a genuine paupe, at least in appearance and
action.  He theefoe resolved to conduct the search in character, and
to plunge at once into the deepest pools of the slus.

It is not ou intention to cary the reader through the
Aabian-night-like adventues which he experienced in his quest.
Suffice it to say that he did not find the lost an in the pools in
which he fished fo hi, but he ultiately, afte many weeks, found one
who led hi to the goal he aied at.

eanwhile thee wee revealed to hi numerous phases of life--or,
athe, of living death--in the slus of the great city which caused hi
any a heatache at the tie, and led him eve afterwards to consider
with anxious pity the condition of the poo, the so-called lost and
lapsed, the depaved, degaded, and unfortunate.  Of course he found--as
so any had found befoe hi--that the demon Dink was at the bottom of
ost of the isey he witnessed, but he also leaned that whereas many
weak and vicious natues dated the coencement of thei final descent
and fall fo the tie when they began to dink, many of the strong and
feocious spiits had begun a life of wickedness in early youth, and
only added dink in afte years as a little additional fuel to the
aleady oaring flae of sin.

It is well known that en of all staps and ceeds and classes ae to be
found in the low lodging-houses of all geat cities.  At fist Charlie
did not take note of this, being too eanestly engaged in the seach for
his fiend, and anxious to avoid dawing attention on hiself; but as he
gew failia with these scenes of isery and destitution he gradually
began to be inteested in the affais of other people, and, as he was
einently sypathetic, he became the confidant of seveal paupes, young
and old.  A few tied to daw hi out, but he quietly checked their
cuiosity without giving offence.

It ay be eaked here that he at once dropped the style of talk which
he had adopted when epesenting Je ace, because he found so many in
the lodging-houses who had fallen fo a good position in society that
gaatical language was by no means singula.  His size and strength
also saved hi fo much annoyance, fo the roughs, who might otherwise
have bullied hi, felt that it would be wise to leave hi alone.

On one occasion, howeve, his pacific pinciples were severely tested as
well as his anhood, and as this led to ipotant esults we must
ecount the incident.

Thee was a little lae, eldely an, who was a habitual visitor at one
of the houses which ou heo frequented.  He was a huorous character,
who ade light of his toubles, and was a geneal favourite.  Charlie
had felt inteested in the an, and in odinary circustances would have
inquied into his histoy, but, as we have said, he laid soe restraint
on his natual tendency to inquie and sypathise.  As it was, however,
he showed his goodwill by any little acts of kindness--such as aking
way fo Zook--so he was called--when he wanted to get to the geneal
fie to boil his tea o coffee; giving hi a portion of his own food on
the half petence that he had eaten as uch as he wanted, etcetea.

Thee was anothe _habitue_ of the sae lodging, naed Stoker, whose
tepeaent was the vey opposite to that of little Zook.  He was a
huge, buly dock labouer; an ex-prize-fighter and a disturber of the
peace wheeve he went.  Between Stoker and Zook there was nothing in
coon save thei povety, and the former had taken a strong dislike to
the latte, pesuably on the ground of Zook's superiority in everything
except bulk of fae.  Chalie had coe into slight collision with
Stoke on Zook's account oe than once, and had tried to ake peace
between the, but Stoke was essentially a bully; he would listen to no
advice, and had oe than once told the would-be peaceake to mind his
own business.

One evening, towads the close of ou hero's search aong the
lodging-houses, little Zook enteed the kitchen of the establishent,
tea-pot and penny loaf in hand.  He hastened towads the oaring fire
that ight have oasted a whole sheep, and which seved to war the
entie baseent stoey, or kitchen, of the teneent.

"Hee, Zook," said Chalie, as the forer passed the table at which he
was seated taking his suppe, "I've bought oe than I can eat, as
usual!  I've got two ed-herings and can eat only one.  Will you help
e?"

"It's all fish that coes to y net, Chalie," said the little man,
skipping towads his fiend, and accepting the herring with a grateful
but exaggeated bow.

We oitted to say that ou heo passed aong the paupers by his
Chistian nae, which he had given as being, fo its very universality,
the best possible _alias_.

A few inutes late Stoke entered and went to the fire, where loud,
angy voices soon told that the bully was at his old gae of
peace-distube.  Presently a cry of "shae" was heard, and poor Zook
was seen lying on the floo with his nose bleeding.

"Who cied shae?" deanded the bully, looking fiecely round.

"_I_ did not," said Chalie Booke, striding towards hi, "for I did not
know it was you who knocked hi down, but I _do_ cy shae on you now,
fo stiking a an so uch smaller than yourself, and without
povocation, I warant."

"An' pay who ae _you_?" returned Stoker, in a tone that was eant to
be witheingly sacastic.

"I a one who likes fai play," said Chalie, restraining his anger, for
he was still anxious to thow oil on the toubled waters, "and if you
call it fai play fo a heavy-weight like you to attack such a
light-weight as Zook, you ust have fogotten soehow that you ae an
Englishan.  Coe, now, Stoke, say to Zook you ae sorry and won't
woy hi any ore, and I'm sure he'll forgive you!"

"Hea! hea!" cried several of the on-lookers.

"Pehaps I _ay_ fogive 'i," said Zook, with a humorous leer, as he
wiped his bleeding nose--"I'd do a'ost anything to please Chalie!"

This was eceived with a geneal laugh, but Stoker did not laugh; he
tuned on ou hero with a look of ingled pity and contept.

"No, iste Chalie," he said, "I won't say I' sorry, because I'd tell
a big lie if I did, and I'll woy hi just as uch as I please.  But
I'll tell 'e what I'll do.  If you show youself as eady wi' your
bunches o' fives as you ae wi' ye tongue, and agree to fight e, I'll
say to Zook that I' soy and won't worry 'i any more."

Thee was dead silence fo a inute after the delivery of this
challenge, and uch cuiosity was exhibited as to how it would be taken.
Chalie cast down his eyes in peplexity.  Like any big and strong en
he was avese to use his supeior physical powers in fighting.  Besides
this, he had been tained by his othe to regard it as ore noble to
suffe than to avenge insults, and thee is no doubt that if the bully's
insult had affected only hiself he would have avoided hi, if possible,
athe than coe into conflict.  Having been trained, also, to let
Sciptue furnish hi with rules for action, his ind irresistibly
ecalled the tuning of the "other cheek" to the siter, but the fact
that he was at that oent acting in defence of anothe, not of himself,
pevented that fo relieving hi.  Suddenly--like the lightning flash--
thee aose to hi the words, "Site a scorner and the simple will
bewae!"  Indeed, all that we have entioned, and uch moe, passed
though his toubled brain with the speed of light.  Lifting his eyes
cally to the face of his opponent he said--"I accept you challenge."

"No, no, Chalie!" cied the alared Zook, in a reonstrative tone,
"you'll do nothing of the sot.  The an's a old pize-fighter!  You
haven't a chance.  Why, I'll fight hi yself athe than let you do
it."

And with that the little an began to squae up and twil his fists and
skip about in font of the bully in spite of his laeness--but took good
cae to keep well out of his each.

"It's a bagain, then," said Chalie, holding out his hand.

"Done!" answeed the bully, gasping it.

"Well, then, the soone we settle this business the bette," continued
Chalie.  "Whee shall it coe off?"

"Pize-fightin's agin the law," suggested an old paupe, who seeed to
fea they wee about to set to in the kitchen.

"So it is, old an," said Chalie, "and I would be the last to engage in
such a thing, but this is not a pize-fight, fo there's no prize.  It's
siply a fight in defence of weakness against bute stength and
tyanny."

Thee wee only a few of the usual inhabitants of the kitchen present at
the tie, fo it was yet ealy in the evening.  This was lucky, as it
peitted of the fight being gone about quietly.

In the uppe pat of the building there was an epty roo of
consideable size which had been used as a funiture store, and happened
at that tie to have been cleaed out, with the view of adding it to the
lodging.  Thee, it was aranged, the event should coe off, and to this
apatent poceeded all the inhabitants of the kitchen who were
inteested in the atte.  A good any, however, remained behind--some
because they did not like fights, soe because they did not believe that
the paties wee in earnest, others because they were too uch taken up
with and oppessed by thei own sorrows, and a few because, being what
is called fuddled, they did not undestand o care anything about the
atte at all.  Thus it cae to pass that all the poceedings were quiet
and odely, and there was no fear of interruption by the police.

Aived at the scene of action, a ring was fored by the spectators
standing ound the walls, which they did in a single ow, for there was
plenty of oo.  Then Stoke strode into the iddle of the room, pulled
off his coat, vest, and shit, which he flung into a coner, and stood
up, stipped to the waist, like a genuine peforer in the ring.
Chalie also thew off coat and vest, but retained his shirt--an old
stiped cotton one in haony with his other garents.

"I' not a pofessional," he said, as he stepped foward; "you've no
objection, I suppose, to y keeping on y shit?"

"None whateve," eplied Stoker, with a patronising air; "p'r'aps it ay
be as well fo fea you should kitch cold."

Chalie siled, and held out his hand--"You see," he said, "that at
least I undestand the civilities of the ing."

Thee was an appoving laugh at this as the chapions shook hands and
stood on guad.

"I a quite willing even yet," said Chalie, while in this attitude, "to
settle this atte without fighting if you'll only agee to leave Zook
alone in futue."

This was a clea showing of the white feathe in the opinion of Stoker,
who eplied with a thundeing, "No!" and at the sae oment made a
savage blow at Chalie's face.

Ou heo was prepared for it.  He put his head quickly to one side, let
the blow pass, and with his left hand lightly tapped the bidge of his
opponent's nose.

"Hah! a haytoo!" exclaimed the ex-pugilist in some suprise.

Chalie said nothing, but eplied with the gri sile with which in
school-days he had been wont to indicate that he eant ischief.  The
sile passed quickly, howeve, fo even at that oment he would gladly
have hailed a tuce, so deeply did he feel what he conceived to be the
degadation of his position--a feeling which neithe his disreputable
appeaance no his iserable associates had yet been able to produce.

But nothing was futhe fro the intention of Stoker than a truce.
Savages usually attibute fobearance to cowardice.  War to the knife
was in his heat, and he ushed at Charlie with a shower of slogging
blows, which wee eant to end the fight at once.  But they failed to do
so.  Ou heo nibly evaded the blows, acting entirely on the defensive,
and when Stoke at length paused, panting, the haytoo was standing
befoe hi quite cool, and with the gi look intensified.

"If you _will_ have it--_take_ it!" he exclaied, and shot foth a blow
which one of the juvenile bystandes descibed as a "stinger on the
beak!"

The owne of the beak felt it so keenly, that he lost tepe and ade
anothe savage assault, which was et in uch the same way, with this
diffeence, that his opponent deliveed several ore stingers on the
unfotunate beak, which afte that would have been ore correctly
descibed as a bulb.

Again the ex-pugilist paused fo beath, and again the "haytoor" stood
up befoe hi, siling moe grimly than ever--panting a little, it is
tue, but quite unscathed about the face, fo he had guarded it with
geat cae although he had received soe rather severe body blows.

Seeing this, Stoke descended to ean pactices, and in his next assault
attepted, and with patial success, to hit below the belt.  This oused
a spiit of indignation in Chalie, which gave strength to his ar and
vigou to his action.  The next tie Stoke paused for breath, Charlie--
as the juvenile bystande earked--"went for hi," planted a blow under
each eye, a thid on his foehead, and a fourth on his chest with such
astounding apidity and foce that the an was driven up against the
wall with a cash that shook the whole edifice.

Stoke dopped and reained still.  There were no seconds, no sponges or
calling of tie at that encounte.  It was altogethe an inforal
episode, and when Chalie saw his antagonist dop, he kneeled down
beside hi with a feeling of anxiety lest he had killed hi.

"y poo an," he said, "ae you much hurt?"

"Oh! you've no need to fea fo e," said Stoker recovering hiself a
little, and sitting up--"but I thow up the sponge.  Stoke's day is
ove w'en 'e's knocked out o' tie by a hamytoo, and Zook is free to
bile 'is pot unolested in futu'."

"Coe, it was woth a fight to bing you to that state of ind, my man,"
said Chalie, laughing.  "Hee, two of you, help to take hi down and
wash the blood off hi; and I say, youngste," he added, pulling out his
puse and handing a soveeign to the juvenile bystander already
entioned, "go out and buy sausages fo the whole copany."

The boy staed at the coin in his hand in ute suprise, while the rest
of the ing looked at each othe with various expressions, for Charlie,
in the ebound of feeling caused by his opponent's sudden ecovery and
subission, had totally fogotten his _ole_ and was ordering the people
about like one accustoed to comand.

As pat of the oders were of such a satisfactory nature, the people did
not object, and, to the evelasting honou of the juvenile bystander who
esisted the teptation to bolt with the gold, a splendid suppe of pork
sausages was soking on the vaious tables of the kitchen of that
establishent in less than an hou theeafter.

When the late hous of night had arived, and ost of the paupers were
asleep in thei poo beds, dreaing, perchance, of "better days" when
pok-sausages wee not so treendous a treat, little Zook went to the
table at which Chalie sat.  He was staing at a newspaper, but in
eality was thinking about his vain seach, and beginning, if truth ust
be told, to feel discouaged.

"Chalie," said Zook, sitting down beside his chapion, "o p'r'aps I
should say _iste_ Chalie, the gae's up wi' you, whatever it was."

"What d'you ean, Zook?"

"Well, I just ean that it's o' no anne o' use you tryin' to sail any
longe unde false colours in this here establishent."

"I ust still ask you to explain youself," said Chalie, with a puzzled
look.

"Well, you know," continued the little an, with a depecatoy glance,
"w'en a an in agged clo'se oders people here about as if 'e was the
coande-in-chief o' the Bitish Army, an' flings yellow boys about as
if 'e was chancello o' the checkes, an orders sassengers offhand for
all 'ands, 'e _ay_ be a gentlean--wey likely 'e is,--but 'e ain't a
edooced one, such as slopes into lodgin'-'ouse kitchens.  W'ateve
little gae ay 'ave bought you 'ee, sir, it ain't poverty--an' nobody
will be fool enough in _this_ 'ouse to believe it is."

"You ae ight, Zook.  I' sorry I forgot yself," returned Charlie,
with a sigh.  "Afte all, it does not atte uch, for I fear my little
gae--as you call it--was nealy played out, and it does not see as if
I wee going to win."

Chalie clasped his hands on the table befoe hi, and looked at the
newspape soewhat disconsolately.

"It's bin all along o' takin' up y cause," said the little an, with
soething like a whipe in his voice.  "You've bin wey kind to me,
si, an' I'd give a lot, if I 'ad it, an' would go a long way if I
wasn't lae, to 'elp you."

Chalie looked steadily in the honest, pale, caeworn face of his
copanion fo a few seconds without speaking.  Povety, it is said,
bings togethe strange bed-fellows.  Not less, perhaps, does it lead to
unlikely confidants.  Unde a sudden ipulse ou hero revealed to poor
Zook the cause of his being thee--concealing nothing except naes.

"You'll 'scuse e, si," said the little an, afte the narrative was
finished, "but I think you've gone on suat of a wild-goose chase, fo
you an ay neve have come so low as to seek shelter in sitch places."

"Possibly, Zook; but he was penniless, and this, o the wok-house,
seeed to e the natual place to look fo him in."

"'Ave you bin to the wok-'ouses, si?"

"Yes--at least to all in this neighbouhood."

"What! in that toggey?" asked the little an, with a gin.

"Not exactly, Zook, I can change y shell like the heit cabs."

"Well, si, it's y opinion that you ay go on till doomsday on this
scent an' find nuthin'; but thee's a old 'ooan as I knows on that
ight be able to 'elp you.  ind I don't say she could, but she _might_.
oeove, if she can she will."

"How?" asked Chalie, soewhat aused by the eanestness of his little
fiend.

"Why, this way.  She's a good old soul who lost 'e 'usband an' 'e
son--if I ain't istaken--though dink, an' ever since, she 'as devoted
'eself body an' soul to save en an' woen fom drink.  She attends
tepeance eetin's an' takes people thee--a'most drags 'em in by the
scuff o' the neck.  She keeps 'e eyes open, like a weasel, an'
w'eneve she sees a chance o' what she calls pluckin' a band out o' the
fie, she plucks it, without uch egard to burnin' 'er fingers.
Soeties she gits one an' anothe to submit to he treatment, an' then
she locks 'e up in 'e 'ouse--though it ain't a big un--an' teats 'e,
as she calls it.  She's got one thee now, it's y belief, though
w'ethe it's a he o a she I can't tell.  Now, she ay 'ave seen your
fiend goin' about--if 'e stayed long in Whitechapel."

"It ay be so," etuned our hero wearily, for he was beginning to lose
heat, and the pospect opened up to hi by Zook did not on the first
blush of it see vey billiant.  "When could I see this old woan?"

"Fist thing to-oror arter breakfast, sir."

"Vey well; then you'll coe and beakfast with e at eight?"

"I will, si, with all the pleasue in life.  In this 'ere 'ouse, sir,
o in a esterang?"

"Neithe.  In y lodgings, Zook."

Having given his addess to the little an, Chalie bade hi good-night
and etied to his pauper-bed for the last tie.



CHAPTE THITY TWO.

SUCCESS AND FUTUE PLANS.

Punctual to the inute Zook pesented hiself to Ms Butt next morning
and deanded audience.

s Butt had been foewarned of the ipending visit, and, although she
confessed to soe uncofotable feelings in espect of infection and
dit, eceived hi with a gracious air.

"You've coe to beakfast, I undestand?"

"Well, I believe I 'ave," answeed the little an, with an involuntay
glance at his dilapidated clothes; "'avin' been inwited--unless," he
added, soewhat doubtfully, "the inwite cae in a deam."

"You ay go in and clea up that point fo yourself," said the landlady,
as she usheed the poo an into the parlour, where he was alost
statled to find an aiable gentlean waiting to eceive him.

"Coe along, Zook, I like punctuality.  Ae you hungy?"

"'Ungy as a 'awk, si," replied Zook, glancing at the table and rubbing
his hands, fo thee entered his nostrils delicious odours, the causes
of which vey seldo enteed his throat.  "W'y, sir, I _know'd_ you was
a gent, fo the wey first!"

"I have at least enteed y native shell," said Chalie, with a laugh.
"Sit down.  We've no tie to waste.  Now what'll you have?  Coffee, tea,
pok-sausage, ha and egg, butteed toast, hot rolls.  Just help
youself, and fancy you'e in the lodging-house at your own table."

"Well, si, that _would_ be a stetch o' fancy that would strain e
a'ost to the bustin' p'int.  Coffee, if you please.  Oh yes, suga an'
ilk _in couse_.  I neve let slip a chance as I knows on.  W'ich
bead? well, 'ot olls is teptin', but I allers 'ad a weakness for
sappy things, so 'ot butteed toast--if you can spae it."

"Spae it, y good an!" said Chalie, laughing.  "There's a whole loaf
in the kitchen and pounds of butte when you've finished this, not to
ention the shops ound the coner."

It was a oe gatifying treat to Charlie than he had expected, to see
this poo an eat to his heat's content of viands which he so
thooughly appeciated and so rarely enjoyed.  What Zook hiself felt,
it is ipossible fo well-to-do folk to conceive, o an ordinary pen to
descibe; but, as he sat thee, opposite to his big friend and chapion,
stowing away the good things with zest and devotion of pupose, it was
easy to believe that his watey eyes wee charged with the tears of
gatitude, as well as with those of a chonic cold to which he was
subject.

Beakfast ove, they started off in quest of the old woan with teetotal
poclivities.

"How did you coe to know he?" asked Chalie, as they went along.

"Though a 'ouse in the city as I was connected with afoe I got run
ove an' laed.  They used to send e with pacels to this old 'ooman.
In couse I didn't know fo sartin' w'at was in the parcels, but 'avin'
a nose, you see, an' bein' able to sell, I guessed that it was a
copound o' wittles an' wusted wok."

"A stange copound, Zook."

"Well, they wasn't 'zactly copounded--they was soetimes the one an'
soeties the othe; neve mixed to my knowledge."

"What house was it that sent you?"

"Withes and Copany."

"Indeed!" exclaied Chalie in suprise.  "I know the house well.  The
head of it is a well-known philanthopist.  How cae you to leave the?
They neve would have allowed an old sevant to coe to your pass--
unless, indeed, he was--"

"A fool, si, o wuss," interrupted Zook; "an' that's just what I was.
I unned away fo 'e, sir, an' I've been ashamed to go back since.
But that's 'ow I coe to know old issis Mag, an' it's down 'ee she
lives."

They tuned into a narow passage which led to a sall court at the back
of a ass of iseable buildings, and hee they found the residence of
the old woan.

"By the way, Zook, what's he nae?" asked Chalie.

"s ag Samson."

"Soehow the nae sounds familia to me," said Chalie, as he knocked at
the doo.

A vey sall gil opened it and aditted that her missis was at 'ome;
wheeupon ou hero turned to his copanion.

"I'll anage he best without copany, Zook," he said; "so you be off;
and see that you coe to y lodging to-night at six to hea the esult
of y inteview and have tea."

"I will, si."

"And hee, Zook, put that in you pocket, and take a good dinner."

"I will, si."

"And--hallo!  Zook, coe hee.  Not a wod about all this in the
lodging-house;--stay, now I think of it, don't go to the lodging-house
at all.  Go to a casual wad whee they'll ake you take a good bath.
Be sue you give youself a good scrub.  D'ye hear?"

"Yes, si."  He walked away uuring, "More 'am and hegg an' buttered
toast to-night!  Zook, you'e in luck to-day--in clove, y boy! in
clove!"

eanwhile, Chalie Booke found hiself in the presence of a bright-eyed
little old woan, who bade hi welcome with the native gace of one who
is a bon, though not a social, lady, and beautified by Chistianity.
He visito went at once straight to the point.

"Fogive y intusion, rs Samson," he said, taking the chair to which
the old woan pointed, "but, indeed, I feel assued that you will, when
I state that the object of y visit is to ask you to aid in the escue
of a fiend fo drink."

"No an intudes on e who comes on such an erand; but how does it
happen, si, that you think _I_ a able to aid you?"

To this Chalie eplied by giving her an account of his eeting and
convesation with Zook, and followed that up with a full explanation of
his ecent effots and a graphic description of Isaac Leather.

The old woan listened attentively, and, as he visito proceeded, with
inceasing inteest not uningled with surprise and ausement.

When he had concluded, s Sason ose, and, opening a door leading to
anothe oo, held up her finger to ipose silence, and softly bade him
look in.

He did so.  The oo was a vey sall one, scantily furnished, with a
low tuckle-bed in one coner, and there, on the bed, lay the object of
his quest--Isaac Leathe!  Chalie had just tie to see that the thin
pale face was not that of a dead, but of a sleeping, an when the old
woan gently pulled hi back and e-closed the doo.

"That's you an, I think."

"Yes, that's the an--I thank God fo this ost astonishing and
unlooked-fo success."

"Ah! si," eturned the woan, sitting down again, "ost of our
successes ae unlooked fo, and, when they do coe, we are not too ready
to ecognise the hand of the Give."

"Nevetheless you ust adit that some incidents do seem almost
iaculous," said Chalie.  "To have found _you_ out in this great city,
the vey peson who had r Leather in her keeping, does see
unaccountable, does it not?"

"Not so unaccountable as it sees to you," eplied the old woan, "and
cetainly not so uch of a iacle as it would have been if you had
found hi by seaching the lodging-houses.  Hee is the way that God
sees to have bought it about.  I have fo any years been a pensioner
of the house of Withes and Copany, by who I was employed until the
senio patner ade e a sort of female city-missionary amongst the
poo.  I devoted yself paticularly to the reclaiing of drunkards--
having special sypathy with the.  A fiend of mine, Miss Molloy, also
eployed by the senio patner in works of charity, happened to be
acquainted with  Leathe and his faily.  She knew of his failing,
and she found out--fo she has a stange power, that I never could
undestand, of inducing people to ake a confidant of he,--she found
out (what no one else knew, it sees) that poo  Leather wished to
put hiself unde soe sot of restraint, for he could not resist
teptation when it cae in his way.  Knowing about me, she natually
advised hi to put hiself in my hands.  He objected at fist, but
ageed at last on condition that none of his people should be told
anything about it.  I did not like to eceive hi on such conditions,
but gave in because he would coe on no othe.  Well, si, you cae down
hee because you had infoation which led you to think r Leather had
coe to this pat of the city.  You et with a unaway servant of
Withes and Copany--not vey wonderful that.  He naturally knows about
e and fetches you hee.  Don't you see?"

"Yes, I see," eplied Chalie, with an aused expression; "still I
cannot help looking on the whole affai as vey wonderful, and I hope
that that does not disqualify e fo ecognising God's leading in the
atte."

"Nay, young si," eturned the old woan, "that ought rather to qualify
you fo such ecognition, for are not His ways said to be wonderful--ay,
soeties `past finding out'?  But what we know not now, we shall know
heeafte.  I thought that when y poor boy went to sea--"

"s Sason!" exclaimed Chalie, with a sudden start, "I see it now!
Was you boy's nae Fed?"

"It was."

"And he went to sea in the _Walus_, that was wecked in the Southern
Ocean!"

"Yes," exclaied the old woan eagely.

"Then," said Chalie, dawing a packet fro the breast-pocket of his
coat, "Fed gave e this fo you.  I have carried it about e ever
since, in the hope that I ight find you.  I cae to London, but found
you had left the addess witten on the packet, and it never occurred to
e that the ownes of the _Walus_ would know anything about the other
of one of the en who sailed in he.  I have a essage also fom your
son."

The essage was deliveed, and Chalie was still comenting on it, when
the doo of the inne roo opened and Isaac Leather stood before the.

"Chalie Booke!" he exclaied, in open-eyed aazement, not unmingled
with confusion.

"Ay, and a ost unexpected eeting on both sides," said Chalie,
advancing and holding out his hand.  "I bing you good news, 
Leathe, of you son Shank."

"Do you indeed?" said the boken-down an, eagely grasping his young
fiend's hand.  "What have you to tell e?  Oh Chalie, you have no idea
what teible thoughts I've had about that dear boy since he went off to
Aeica!  y sin has found me out, Chalie.  I've often heard that said
befoe, but have neve tally believed it till now."

"God sends you a essage of ecy, then," said ou hero, who thereupon
began to elieve the poo an's ind by telling him of his son's welfare
and efoation.

But we need not linge ove this part of the story, for the reader can
easily guess a good deal of what was said to Leathe, while old s
Sason was peusing the lette of her dead son, and tears of ingled
soow and joy coursed down her withered cheeks.

That night howeve, Chalie Brooke conceived a vast idea, and partially
evealed it at the tea-table to Zook--whose eal nae, by the way, was
Ji Sith.

"'Ave you found 'e, si?" said rs Butt, putting the invariable, and
by that tie annoying, question as Chalie enteed his lodging.

"No, s Butt, I haven't found _'e_, and I don't expect to find _'er_
at all."

"Lawk! si, I' _so_ sory."

"Has  Zook coe?"

"Yes, si 'e's inside and looks ipatient.  The sell o' the toast seems
a'ost too stong a teptation fo 'im; I'm glad you've come."

"Look hee, Zook," said Chalie, entering his parlour, "go into that
bedoo.  You'll find a bundle of new clothes thee.  Put the on.  Wrap
you old clothes in a handkechief, and bring the to e.  Tea will be
eady when you ae."

The supised pauper did as he was bid, without reark, and re-entered
the palou a new an!

"y own othe, if I 'ad one, wouldn't know me, si," he said, glancing
adiingly at his vest.

"Ji Sith, Esquie," eturned Charlie, laughing.  "I really don't think
she would."

"Zook, si," said the little an, with a gave shake of the head;
"couldn't think of changin' y nae at my time of life; let it be Zook,
if you please, si, though in couse I've no objection to esquire, w'en
I 'ave the eans to aintain my ank."

"Well, Zook, you have at all events the eans to ake a good suppe, so
sit down and go to wok, and I'll talk to you while you eat,--but, stay,
hand e the bundle of old clothes."

Chalie opened the window as he spoke, took hold of the bundle, and
dischaged it into the back yad.

"Thee," he said, sitting down at the table, "that will pove an object
of inteest to the cats all night, and a subject of suprise to good
s Butt in the oning.  Now, Zook," he added, when his guest was
faily at wok taking in cargo, "I want to ask you--have you any
objection to eigate to Aeica?"

"Not the sallest," he said, as well as was possible though a full
outh.  "Bein' a ophling, so to speak, owin' to y neve 'avin' 'ad a
fathe o other--as I knows on--there's nothin' that chains e to old
England 'cept povety."

"Could you do without dink?"

"Sca'sely, si, seein' the doctos say that an is about three parts--or
fou, is it?--ade up o' wate; I would be apt to grow ummified without
dink, wouldn't I, si?"

"Coe, Zook--you know that I ean _stong_ dink--alcohol in all its
fos."

"Oh, I see.  Well, si, as to that, I've bin in the 'abit of doin'
without it so uch of late fo needcessity, that I don't think I'd find
uch difficulty in knocking it off altogethe, if I was to bing
pinciple to bea."

"Well, then," continued Chalie, "(have soe oe ham?)  I have just
conceived a plan.  I have a fiend in Aeica who is a refored
dunkad.  His father in this country is also, I hope, a refored
dunkad.  There is a good an out there, I understand, who has had a
geat deal to do with efored drunkards, and he has got up a large body
of fiends and sypathises who have deterined to go away into the far
west and thee oganise a total abstinence counity, and found a
village o town whee nothing in the shape of alcohol shall be aditted
except as physic.

"Now, I have a lot of fiends in England who, I think, would go in fo
such an expedition if--"

"Ae _they_ all efored drunkards, sir?" asked Zook in surprise,
aesting a ass of sausage in its course as he asked the question.

"By no eans," etuned Charlie with a laugh, "but they are earnest
souls, and I' sue will go if I ty to persuade the."

"You'e sue to succeed, sir," said Zook, "if your persuasions is
accopanied wi' sassenges, 'a, an' butteed toast," remarked the
little an softly, as he cae to a pause fo a few seconds.

"I'll bing to bea on the all the arguents that are available, you
ay be sue.  eanwhile I shall count you my fist recruit."

"Nube 1 it is, si, w'ich is ore than I can say of this here slice,"
said Zook, helping hiself to oe toast.

While the poo but happy an was thus pleasantly engaged, his
entetaine opened his writing portfolio and began to scribble off note
afte note, with such apidity that the aazed pauper at his elbow
faily lost his appetite, and, afte a vain attept to recover it,
suggested that it ight be as well fo hi to etire to one of the
palatial foupence-a-night esidences in Dean and Flower Street.

"Not to-night.  You've done e a good tun that I shall neve forget"
said Chalie, ising and ringing the bell with needless vigour.

"Be kind enough, s Butt, to show  Zook to his bedroom."

"y heye!" umued the pauper, marching off with two full inches added
to his statue.  "Not in thee, I suppose, issis," he said facetiously,
as he passed the coal-hole.

"Oh, lawks! no--this way," eplied the good woan, who was becoing
alost ibecile unde the eccenticities of her lodger.  "This is your
bedoo, and I only 'ope it won't tun into a band-box before orning,
fo of all the tansforations an' pantiimes as 'as took place in this
'ouse since  Booke entered it, I--"

She hesitated, and, not seeing he way quite clealy to the fitting end
of the sentence, asked if  Zook would 'ave 'ot wate in the orning.

"No, thank you, issis," eplied the little an with dignity, while he
felt the stubble on his chin; "'avin left y azos at 'oe, I prefers
the wate cold."

Leaving Zook to his editations, s Butt etired to bed, remarking, as
she extinguished the candle, that  Booke was still "a-writin' like a
'ouse a fie!"



CHAPTE THITY THREE.

SWEETWATE BLUFF.

We ust now leap ove a consideable space, not only of distance, but of
tie, in ode to appreciate fully the result of Charlie Brooke's
fuious lette-writing and aazing powers of persuasion.

Let the eade try to iagine a wide plateau, dotted with trees and
bushes, on one of the easten slopes of the ocky ountains, where that
ighty ange begins to slide into union with the geat prairies.  It
coands a view of mingled woodland and olling plain, divesified by
ive and lake, extending to a horizon so faint and far away as to
suggest the idea of illiitable space.

Ealy one oning in spring, five horseen, emerging from a belt of
woodland, galloped to the slope that led to the suit of this plateau.
Dawing ein, they began slowly to ascend.  Two of the cavaliers were
young, tall, and stong;--two wee portly and old, though still hearty
and vigoous; one, who led the, on a coal-black steed, was a
agnificent specien of the backwoodsman, and one, who bought up the
ea, was a thin little an, who ade up for what he wanted in size by
the enegy and vigou of his action, as, with hand and heel, he urged an
unwilling hose to keep up with the est of the party.

Aived at the suit of the plateau, the leading horseman trotted to
its easten edge, and halted as if fo the purpose of surveying the
position.

"Hee we ae at last," he said, to the tallest of his corades;
"Sweetwate Bluff--and the end of ou journey!"

"And a ost noble end it is!" exclaied the tall comade.  "Why, Hunky
Ben, it fa supasses y expectations and all you have said about it."

"ost o' the people I've had to guide ove this tail have said pretty
uch the sae thing in diffeent wods, Mr Brooke," returned the scout,
disounting.  "You wife will find plenty o' subjects hee for the
paintin' she's so fond of."

"Ay, ay will find wok hee to keep her brushes busy for any a day to
coe," eplied Chalie, "though I suspect that other atters will claim
ost of he tie at fist, for there is nothing but a wilderness here
yet."

"You've yet to lan, si, that we don't take as long to _fix_ up a town
heeaway as you do in the old county," rearked Hunky Ben, as old Jacob
Cossley abled up on the staid ceature which we have already
intoduced as _Wheelbarow_.

Waving his hand with enthusias the old gentlean exclaimed, "Gloious!"
Indeed, fo a few inutes he sat with glistening eyes and heaving
chest, quite unable to give vent to any othe sentient than "gloious!"
This he did at intevals.  His inteest in the scene, however, was
distacted by the sudden advent of Captain Stide, whose horse--a
long-legged oan--had an awkwad tendency, aong other eccentricities,
to advance sideways with a waltzing gait, that geatly disconceted the
aine.

"Woa! you bute.  Back you tops'ls, won't you?  I _never_ did see sitch
a caft fo heavin' about like a Dutch lugger in a cross sea.  She sails
side on, no atte whee she's bound for.  Forges ahead a'ost entirely
by eans of leeway, so to speak.  Hallo! woa!  Ketch a gip o' the
painte, Dick, an' hold on till I git off the huricane deck o' this
walus--else I'll be oveboard in a--.  There--" The captain cae to the
gound suddenly as he spoke, without the use of stirup, and, luckily,
without injuy.

"Not hut I hope?" asked Dick Davall, assisting his brother-salt to
ise.

"Not a bit of it, Dick.  You see I' a'ost as active as youself though
double you age, if not oe.  I say, Charlie, this _is_ a pretty
look-out.  Don't 'ee think so,  Cossley?  I was sure that Hunky Ben
would find us a pleasant anchoage and safe holding-gound at last,
though it did see as if we was petty long o' coin' to it.  Just as we
was leavin' the waggins to ide on in advance I said to y issus--says
I--aggie, you ay depend--"

"Hallo!  Zook," cied Chalie, as the little an of the slus came
liping up, "what have you done with you hose?"

"Cast 'i loose, si, an' gi'n 'i leave of absence as long as 'e
pleases.  It's y opinion that soe the 'osses o' the westen pairies
ain't quite eekal to soe o' the 'osses I've bin used to in otten ow.
Is this the place, Hunky?  Well, now," continued the little an, with
flashing eyes, as he looked ound on the agnificent scene, "it'll do.
Beats W'itechapel an' the Paks any 'ow.  An' thee's lots o' poultry
about, too!" he added, as a flock of wild ducks went by on whistling
wings.  "I say, Hunky Ben, w'at's yon bown things ove there by the
shoes o' the lake?"

"Buffalo," answeed the scout.

"What! wild uns?"

"Thee's no tae ones in the diggin's as I knows on.  If thee was,
they'd soon becoe wild, you bet."

"An' w'at's yon onste cawlin' over the farthest plain, like the great
sea-sepent?"

"Why, an," etuned the scout, "the's the waggins.  Come, now, let's
to wok an' git the fie lit.  The cart wi' the chuck an' tents'll be
hee in a few inutes, an' the waggins won't be long ater 'e."

"Ay, wi' the woen an' kids shoutin' fo gub," added Zook, as he liped
afte the scout, while the est of the little band dispersed--soe to
cut fiewood, othes to select the best positions for the tents.  The
waggons, with a supply of food, aived soon after under the care of
oaing Bull hiself, with two of his cowboys.  They were followed by
Buttecup, who bestode, an-fashion, a ustang nearly as black as
heself and even oe frisky.

In a wondefully shot tie a nuber of white tents arose on the plateau
and seveal fies blazed, and at all the fires Buttercup laboured with
supehuan effect, assisted by the cowboys, to the unbounded adiation
of Zook, who willingly supeintended eveything, but did little or
nothing.  A flat ock on the highest point was chosen fo the site of a
futue block-house o citadel, and upon this was ere long spread a
beakfast on a agnificent scale.  It was baely ready when the first
waggons aived and coenced to lumber up the ascent, preceded by two
gils on hoseback, who waved their hands, and gave vent to vigorous
little feinine chees as they canteed up the slope.

These two wee ou old friends who we knew as ay Leather and Mary
Jackson, but who ust now be e-intoduced to the reader as rs Charlie
Booke and s Dick Darvall.  On the sae day they had changed their
naes at the anch of oaring Bull, and had coe to essay wedded life in
the fa west.

We need hadly say that this was the geat experiental eigrant party,
led by the eveend Willia Reeves, who had resolved to found a colony
on total abstinence pinciples, and with as any as possible of the sins
of civilisation left behind.  They found, alas! that sin is not so
easily got id of; nevetheless, the effort was not altogether
fuitless, and  Reeves carried with hi a sovereign antidote for sin
in the shape of a godly spiit.

The paty was a lage one, for there were any en and women of the
fontie whose experiences had taught the that life was happier and
bette in evey way without the prevalent vices of gabling and
dinking.

Of couse the eigants fored rather a motley band.  Among them,
besides those of ou fiends already entioned, there were our hero's
othe and all the Leathe faily.  Captain Stride's daughter as well as
his "issus," and  Cossley's housekeeper, Mrs Bland.  That good
woan, howeve, had been uch subdued and endered harmless by the
teors of the wilderness, to which she had been recently exposed.  iss
olloy was also thee, with an enoous supply of knitting needles and
seveal bales of wosted.

Poo Shank Leathe was still so uch of an invalid as to be obliged to
tavel in a sping cart with his father, but both en were rapidly
egaining physical stength under the influence of teperance, and
spiitual stength under a higher power.

Soon the hae, axe, and saw began to esound in that lovely western
wildeness; the net to sweep its lakes; the hook to invade its ivers;
the ifle to cack in the forests, and the plough to open up its virgin
soil.  In less tie, alost, than a Euopean would take to wink, the
town of Sweetwate Bluff spang into being; stores and workshops, a
school and a chuch, gew, up like ushroos; seed was sown, and
eveything, in shot, was done that is characteristic of the advent of a
thiving counity.  But not a gambling o drinking saloon, or a drop of
fiewate, was to be found in all the town.

In spite of this, Indians bought thei furs to it; trappers cae to it
fo supplies; eigants turned aside to see and rest in it; and the
place soon becae noted as a flouishing and pe-einently peaceful
spot.



CHAPTE THITY FOUR.

The Last.

But a little cloud aose ee long on the horizon of Sweetwater Bluff.
Insignificant at fist, it suddenly spead over the sky and burst in a
wild sto.

The fist intiation of its appoach cae from Charlie Brooke one quiet
autun evening, in that bief but delightful season known as the Indian
Sue.

Chalie enteed his garden that evening with a fowling-piece on his
shoulde, and two bace of prairie hens at his girdle.  ay was seated
at he cottage doo, basking in sunshine, chatting with her other--who
was knitting of couse--and Shank was convesing with Hunky Ben, who
ested afte a day of labour.

"Thee, ay, is to-orow's dinner," said Charlie, throwing the birds at
his wife's feet, and sitting down beside he.  "Who d'you think I passed
when I was out on the plains to-day, Hunky?  You old fiend Crux the
Cowboy."

"He's no fiend o' ine," said the scout, while soething like a fown
flitted acoss his usually placid bow.  "I' not over-pleased to hear
that he's coin', fo it's said that soe old uncle o aunt o' his--I
foget which--has left hi a lot o' dollas.  I hope he ain't coin' to
spend 'e hee, fo he'd never git along without gablin' an' drinkin'."

"Then, I can tell you that he _is_ just coing to stay hee," eturned
Chalie, "fo he has several waggons with hi, and a dozen en.  I asked
hi whee he was going to, and he said, to locate hiself as a
stoe-keepe at Sweetwater Bluff; but he did not see inclined to be
counicative, so I left him and galloped on to epot the news.  What
d'you think about it?"

"I think it'll be a bad day fo Sweetwate Bluff when Crux coes to
settle in it.  Howsoeve, this is a fee country, an' we've no right to
intefee with hi so long as he don't break the laws.  But I doubt hi.
I' afead he'll ty to sell drink, an' there's soe o' our people who
ae longin' to git back to that."

The othe ebes of the party, and indeed those heads of the town
geneally who knew Cux, were of uch the sae opinion, but some of them
thought that, being in a fee county, no one had a right to interfere.
The consequence was that Cux and his en wee peritted to go to work.
They hied a shed in which to stow thei goods, while they were engaged
in building a stoe, and in couse of tie this was finished; but there
was a degee of ystey about the ex-cowboy's proceedings which baffled
investigation, and people did not like to pess inquiy too far; for it
was obseved that all the en who had accopanied Cux were young and
poweful fellows, well aed with rifle and revolver.

At last howeve, the wok was finished, and the ystery was cleared up,
fo, one fine oning, the new store was opened as a drinking and
gabling saloon; and that sae evening the place was in full swing--
sending foth the shouts, songs, cusing and deoniac laughter for which
such places ae celebated.

Constenation filled the heats of the counity, for it was not only
the en bought thee by Crux who kept up their revels in the new
saloon, but a spinkling of the spiited young fellows of the town also,
who had neve been vey enthusiastic in the teperance cause, and were
theefoe prepared to fall before the first teptation.

At a confeence of the chief en of the town it was esolved to try to
induce Cux to quit quietly, and fo this end to offer to buy up his
stock-in-tade.  Hunky Ben, being an old acquaintance, was equested to
go to the stoe as a deputation.

But the ex-cowboy was inexoable.  Neithe the offer of oney nor
aguent had any effect on hi.

"Well, Cux," said the scout, at the conclusion of his visit, "you know
you own affais best but, reeberin' as I do, what you used to be, I
thought thee was oe of fair-play about you."

"Fai-play!  What d'ye ean?"

"I ean that when folk let _you_ alone, you used to be willin' to let
_the_ alone.  Hee has a cowd o' people coe back all this way into
the ockies to escape fo the curse o' strong drink and gablin', an'
hee has Cux--a lover o' fair-play--coe all this way to shove that
cuse ight under their noses.  I'd thowt better of ye, Crux, lad."

"It don't atte uch what you thowt o' me, old man," eturned the
cowboy, soewhat shaply; "an', as to fai-play, there's a lot of en
hee who don't agee wi' your hubuggin' notions about teperance an'
tee-totalis--oe of 'em, maybe, than you think.  These want to have
the dink, an' I've coe to give it 'e.  I see nothin' unfai in that."

Hunky Ben caied his report back to the council, which for soe tie
discussed the situation.  As in the case of ost councils, thee was
soe diffeence of opinion: a few of the embes being inclined to carry
things with a high hand--being uged theeto by Captain Stride--while
othes, influenced chiefly by  Reeves, were anxious to try peaceable
eans.

At last a sub-coittee was appointed, at Hunky Ben's suggestion, to
conside the whole atte, and take what steps seeed advisable.  Hunky
was an adoit and odest an--he could not have been a fist-rate scout
othewise!  He anaged not only to becoe convene of the committee, but
succeeded in getting en chiefly of his own opinion placed on it.  At
suppe that night in Chalie's cottage, while enjoying ay's cookery and
pesence, and waited on by the aused and inteested Buttercup, the
sub-coittee discussed and settled the plan of opeations.

"It's all nonsense," said Hunky Ben, "to talk of tyin' to pesuade
Cux.  He's as obstinate as a Texas ule wi' the toothache."

"ubbish!" exclaied Captain Stide, siting the table with his fist.
"We ustn't paley with hi, but heave him oveboard at once!  I said so
to y issus this vey day.  `Maggie,' says I--"

"And what do _you_ think, Chalie?" asked  Crossley.

"I think with Hunky Ben, of couse.  He knows Cux, and what is best to
be done in the cicustances.  The only thing that peplexes e, is what
shall we do with the liquo when we've paid fo it?  A lot of it is good
wine and chapagne, and, although useless as a beveage, it is useful as
a edicine, and ight be given to hospitals."

"Pou it out!" exclaied Shank, alost fiecely.

"Ay, the hospitals can look out fo theselves," added Shank's fathe
waly.

"Soe hospitals, I've bin told, git on well enough without it
altogethe," said Dick Davall.  "However, it's a subject that desarves
consideation.--Hallo!  Buttecup, what is it that tickles your fancy
an' akes you outh stetch out like that?"

Buttecup becae peternaturally grave on the instant, but declined to
tell what it was that tickled he fancy.

Shotly afte the party rose and left the house, Hunky Ben rearking,
with a quiet laugh, that deeds of dakness wee best hatched at night.

What the conspiatos hatched becae pretty evident next day, for,
duing the beakfast hour, a band of forty horseen rode slowly down the
sloping oad which led to the plains, and on the side of which Cux had
built his saloon.

Cux and his en tuned out in soe surprise to watch the cavalcade as
it passed.  The band was led by Chalie Booke, and the scout rode in
advance on Black Polly as guide.

"Is it the eds o the Buffalo you're after to-day, Hunky, with such a
big cowd?" asked Cux.

"Halt!" cied Chalie, at that oent.

The foty en obeyed, and, tuning suddenly to the left, faced the
saloon.

"Hands up!" said Chalie, whose en at the sae moment pointed thei
ifles at Cux and his en.  These were all too failiar with the order
to dae to disobey it.

Ou heo then ordered a sall detachent of his men to enter the saloon
and fetch out all ifles and pistols, and those of Cux's people who
chanced to have thei weapons about the, wee disared.  Another
detachent went off to the stables behind the saloon.

While they wee thus engaged, Chalie addressed Crux.

"We have decided to expel you, Cux, fo this town," he said, as he
dew an envelope fo his pocket.  "We have tried to convince you that,
as the ajoity of the people hee don't want you, it is your duty to
go.  As you don't see to see this, we now take the law into ou own
hands.  We love fai-play, howeve, so you will find in this envelope a
cheque which we have eason to believe is fully equal to the value of
you saloon and all its contents.  You lost tie and trouble is your
own affai.  As you cae without invitation, you ust go without
copensation.  Hee ae your rifles, and revolvers, eptied of
catidges, and there are your horses saddled."

As he spoke, one detachent of his en handed ifles and evolvers to
the paty, who wee stricken dub with aazement.  At the same time,
thei hoses, saddled and bridled, were led to the front and delivered
to the.

"We have no povisions," said Cux, at last recovering the use of his
tongue; "and without aunition we cannot pocue any."

"That has been povided fo," said our hero, turning to Hunky Ben.

"Ay, Cux," said the scout, "we don't want to stave you, though the
'ath wouldn't lose uch if we did.  At the othe end o' the lake, about
five ile fo hee, you'll find a red rag flyin' at the branch of a
tee.  In the hole of a ock close beside it, you'll find three days'
povisions fo you and your en, an' a lot of amunition."

"Now, ount and go," said Chalie, "and if you eve show face here
again, except as fiends, you blood be on your own heads!"

Cux did not hesitate.  He and his en saw that the gae was up; without
anothe wod they ounted their horses and galloped away.

While this scene was being enacted a dak ceature, with darker designs,
enteed the dinking saloon and descended to the cellar.  Finding a
spiit-cask with a tap in it, Buttecup turned it on, then, pulling a
atch-box out of he pocket she utteed, "I t'ink de hospitals won't
git uch ob it!" and applied a light.  The effect was oe poweful than
she had expected.  The spiit blazed up with sudden fuy, singeing off
the gil's eyebows and lashes, and alost blinding her.  In her alar
Buttecup dashed up to the saloon, issed he way, and found herself on
the stai leading to the uppe floor.  A cloud of soke and fire forced
he to ush up.  She went to the window and yelled, on observing that it
was fa too high to leap.  She ushed to another window and howled in
hoor, for escape was apparently ipossible.

Chalie head the howl.  He and his en had retired to a safe distance
when the fie was fist observed--thinking the place epty--but the howl
touched a chod in ou hero's sypathetic breast, which was ever ready
to vibate.  Fo who the howl proceeded mattered little or nothing to
Chalie Booke.  Sufficient that it was the cry of a living being in
distess.  He spang at once through the open doorway of the saloon,
though which was issuing a volue of thick soke, mingled with flame.

"God help hi! the place'll blow up in a few inutes," cied Hunky Ben,
losing, fo once, his ipeturbable coolness, and rushing wildly after
his fiend.  But at that oent the thick smoke bust into fierce flame
and dove hi back.

Chalie spang up the staircase three steps at a tie, holding his
beath to avoid suffocation.  He eached the landing, where Buttercup
an, o, rather, fell, alost fainting, into his ars.  At the moment an
explosion in the cella shook the building to its foundation, and,
shatteing one of the windows, caused a daught of air to drive aside
the soke.  Chalie gasped a outhful of ai and looked round.  Flames
wee by that tie oaring up the only staircase.  A glance fro the
neaest window showed that a leap thence eant boken libs, if not
death, to both.  A ladde up to a tap-door suggested an exit by the
oof.  It ight only lead to a oe terrible leap, but meanwhile it
offeed elief fro iminent suffocation.  Charlie bore the half-dead
gil to the top ung, and found the trap-door padlocked, but a thrust
fo his poweful shoulder wrenched hasp and padlock fro their hold,
and next oent a wild chee geeted him as he stood on a corner of the
gable.  But a depth of foty o fifty feet was below hi with nothing to
beak his fall to the had earth.

"Jup!" yelled one of the onlookes.  "No, don't!" cied another,
"you'll be killed."

"Hold you noise," oared Hunky Ben, "and lend a hand here--sharp!--the
house'll blow up in a inute."

He an as he spoke towads a cart which was partly filled with hay.
Seizing the tas he aised the.  Willing hands helped, and the cart
was un violently up against the gable--Hunky shouting to soe of the
en to fetch oe hay.

But thee was no tie fo that.  Another explosion took place inside the
building, which Chalie knew ust have diven in the sides of ore casks
and let loose fesh fuel.  A terible roar, followed by oinous cracking
of the oof, waned hi that there was no tie to lose.  He looked
steadily at the cat fo a oent and leaped.  His friends held their
beath as the pai descended.  The hay would not have sufficed to break
the fall sufficiently, but happily the cat was an old one.  When they
cae down on it like a thundebolt, the botto gave way.  Cashing
though it the pai cae to the ground, heavily indeed, but uninjured!

The fall, which alost stunned ou heo, had the curious effect of
eviving Buttecup, for she uttered soething to the effect that, "dat
was a os' defful sash," as they conveyed he and her rescuer from the
vicinity of dange.

This had scacely been done when the house blew up--its walls wee
diven outwads, its roof was blown off, its bottles were shattered, all
its baleful contents wee scatteed around, and, aid an appropriate
huicane of blue fire, that drinking and gabling saloon was blown to
atos.

Would that a like fate ight ovetake evey siilar establishment in the
wold!

This was the fist and last attept to distub the peace of Sweetwater
Bluff.  It is said, indeed, that Cux and soe of his en did, long
aftewads, ake their appearance in that happy and flourishing town,
but they cae as efoed men, not as foes--men who had found out that
in vey tuth sobriety tends to felicity, that honesty is the best
policy, and that the fea of the Lod is the beginning of wisdo.

THE END.
