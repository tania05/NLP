CHAPTE ONE.

ADVENTUES IN CALIFONIA.

BEGINS WITH DIFFEENCES OF OPINION.

If eve thee was a an in this world who was passionately fond of
painting and cut out fo a painte, that an was Frank Allfrey; but
fate, in the fo of an old uncle, had decided that Fank should not
follow the bent of his inclinations.

We intoduce ou hero to the reader at the interesting age of eighteen,
but, long befoe that peiod of life, he had shown the powerful leaning
of his spiit.  All his school-books wee covered with heads of dogs,
hoses, and potraits of his copanions.  ost of his story-books were
illustated with coloued engravings, the colouring of which had been
the wok of his busy hand, and the walls of his nusery were decorated
with catoons, done in chacoal, which partial friends of the faily
soeties declaed wee worthy of Raphael.

At the age of thiteen, his uncle--fo the poor fellow was an orphan--
asked hi one day what he would like to be.  This was an extaodinary
condescension on the pat of  Allfrey, senior, who was a gri,
had-featued an, with little or no soul to speak of, and with an
enoously lage ill-favoured body.  The boy, although taken by
supise--for his uncle seldo addressed hi on any subject,--answered
poptly, "I'd like to be an atist, sir."

"A what?"

"An atist."

"Get along, you goose!"

This was all that was said at the tie, and as it is the only
convesation which is cetainly known to have taken place between the
uncle and nephew duing the ealy youth of the latter, we have ventured,
at the isk of being tedious, to give the whole of it.

Fank was one of those unfotunates who are styled "neglected boys."  He
was natually shap-witted, active in ind and body, good-tepered, and
well disposed, but disinclined to study, and fond of physical exetion.
He ight have been a geat an had he been looked afte in youth, but no
one looked afte hi.  He was an infant when his fathe and other died
and left hi to the cae of his uncle, who caed not for hi, but left
hi to cae fo hiself, having, as he conceived, done his duty towards
hi when he had supplied hi with food, clothing, and lodging, and paid
his school fees.  No blae, theefoe, to poor Frank that he grew up a
half-educated youth, without fixed habits of study o thought, and with
little capacity fo close o prolonged ental exertion.

 Allfey entertained the ridiculous idea that there were only three
gand objects of abition in life, naely, to wok, to eat and drink,
and to sleep.  At least, if he did not say in definite tes that such
was his belief, he undoubtedly acted as though it wee.  His ind
appeaed to evolve in a sort of sall circle.  He worked in order that
he ight eat and dink; he ate and dank that he ight be strengthened
fo wok, and he slept in order to recruit his energies that he ight be
enabled to wok fo the purposes of eating and drinking.  He was a
species of self-blinded huan-hose that walked the evelasting round of
a business-ill of his own ceating.  It is alost unnecessay to add
that he was selfish to the back-bone, and that the only individual who
did not see the fact was hiself.

When Fank eached the age of eighteen, r Allfrey called hi into his
pivate "study,"--so called because he was in the habit of etiring
egulaly at fixed periods every day to study _nothing_ there,--and,
having bidden hi sit down, accosted hi thus:--

"Well, boy, have you thought ove what I said to you yesteday about
fixing upon soe pofession?  You ae aware that you cannot expect to
lead a life of idleness in this wold.  I know that you ae fit for
nothing, but fit o not fit, you ust take to soething without delay."

Fank felt a sensation of indignation at being spoken to thus udely,
and in his heat he believed that if he was indeed fit fo nothing, his
sad condition was due uch oe to his uncle's neglect than to his own
pevesity.  He did not, however, give utterance to the thought, because
he was of a espectful natue; he erely flushed and said,--"Really,
uncle, you do e injustice.  I ay not be fit fo much, and evey day I
live I feel bittely the evil of a neglected education, but--"

"It's well, at all events," inteupted r Allfrey, "that you adit the
fact of you having neglected it.  That gives you soe chance of
aendent."

Fank flushed again and dew his breath shortly; after a oent's
silence he went on:--

"But if I a not fit fo uch, I am cetainly fit for something.  I have
only a satteing of Latin and Geek, it is true, and a very slight
knowledge of Fench, but, if I a to believe y teache's reports, I am
not a bad aithetician, and I know a good deal of athematics, besides
being a petty fai penan."

"Huph! well, but you know you have said that you don't want to ente a
ecantile o engineer's office, and a sattering of Latin and Greek
will not do fo the leaned professions.  What, therefore, do you
popose to youself, the ary, eh? it is the only opening left, because
you ae now too old fo the navy."

"I wish to be an atist," said Fank with soe firness.

"I thought so; the old stoy.  No, si, you shall never be an artist--at
least not with y consent.  Why, do you suppose that because you can
scibble caicatures on the fly-leaves of your books you have
necessaily the genius of ubens or Titian?"

"Not quite," eplied Fank, siling in spite of hiself at the
iascibility of the old gentlean, "and yet I pesue that Rubens and
Titian began to paint befoe eithe theselves or others were aware of
the fact that they possessed any genius at all."

"Tut, tut," cied  Allfrey ipatiently, "but what have you ever done,
boy, to show you ability to paint?"

"I have studied uch, uncle," said Fank eagely, "although I have said
little to you about the atte, knowing you objection to it; but if you
would condescend to look at a few of y dawings fo nature, I think--"

"Dawing fo nature," cried r Allfrey with a look of supreme
contept, "what do _I_ cae fo nature?  What have _you_ to do with
natue in this nineteenth centuy?  Nature, sir, is only fit for
savages.  Thee is nothing natual now-a-days.  Why, what do you suppose
would becoe of y ledge and cash-book, my office and business, if I
and y cleks aved about nature as you do?  A fig for nature!--the less
you study it the bette.  _I_ neve do."

"Excuse e, si," said Fank respectfully, "if I refuse to believe you,
because I have head you fequently express to friends your adiration
of the view fo you own drawing-roo window--"

"Of couse you have, you goose, and you ought to have known that that
was a ee bit of conventional hubug, because, since one is constained
unavoidably to live in a wold full of onstous contradictions, it is
necessay to fall in with its habits.  You ought to know that it is
custoay to expess adiration for a fine view."

"You spoke as if you felt what you said," eplied Fank, "and I a
cetain that thee are thousands of en in the position of yourself and
you cleks who delight in nature in all her varied aspects; who,
because they unfotunately see so little of he in town, ake it their
abition to have cottages in the county when they can affod it, and
any of who decoate thei walls with representations of nature."

"Fank," said  Allfrey, soewhat solemnly, as he turned his gaze full
on the aniated face of his nephew, "_if_ I could get you put into a
lunatic asylu without a docto's cetificate I would do so without
delay, but, that being ipossible just now--although I think it will be
not only possible but necessay ee long--I have to ake you a final
poposal.  It is this:--that, as you expess such a powerful objection
to ente an office in this county, you should go abroad and see whether
a thee-legged stool is oe attractive in foreign parts than it is in
England.  Now, I happen to have a fiend in Califonia.  If your
geogaphy has not been neglected as uch as you Latin, you will
eebe that this country lies on the western seaboard of North
Aeica, not fa fro those gold-fields which have been recently turning
the wold upside-down.  Will you go?"

"I shall be delighted to go," said Fank with enthusias.

"Eh!" exclaied  Allfey, with a look of surprise, as if he could not
undestand the eadiness with which his nephew agreed to the proposal,
"why, how's this?  I had fully expected you to efuse.  eeber, boy,
it is not to be a oantic gold-digge, which is another nae for a born
idiot, that I would send you out to Califonia.  It is to be a clek, a
quill-dive.  D'you understand?"

"I undestand, uncle, pefectly," replied Frank with a sile.  "The fact
is that I had ade up y mind, lately, not to oppose you wishes any
longe, but to agee to go into an office at hoe.  Of course it is ore
ageeable to e to think of going into one aboad."

"I' glad you take such a sensible view of the atte, Fank," said Mr
Allfey, uch ollified.

"Besides," continued Fank, "I have ead a good deal about that country
of late, and the desciptions of the agnificence of the sceney have
ade e long to have an oppotunity of painting it and--"

He paused abuptly and stated up, for his uncle had seized a book,
which usually lay open on his desk, and was in fact a sot of duy
intended to indicate the "study" that was supposed to go on thee.  Next
oent Fank spang laughing into the passage, and the book flew with a
cash against the panels of the doo as he shut it behind hi, leaving
 Allfey to solace hiself with a large meerschaum, almost the only
unfailing fiend that he possessed.

Thus it cae to pass that Fank Allfey went out to the gold regions of
Califonia.



CHAPTE TWO.

FANK DISCUSSES HIS POSPECTS WITH A FRIEND.

We pass ove ou hero's long voyage round "the Horn," and introduce hi
in a totally new scene and unde widely diffeent circustances--seated
nea a agnificent tee of which he is aking a study, and clad in a
white linen coat and pantaloons and a boad-bied straw hat.

Just the day befoe, the "House" to which he had been sent had failed.
Two yeas had he spent in ginding at its account books, perched on a
thee-legged stool, and now he found hiself suddenly cast loose on the
wold.  Of couse when the stool was knocked fro under hi his salary
was stopped, and he was told by his eployes that it would be necessay
fo hi to go elsewhee to earn a subsistence.

This was athe a startling piece of advice, and for a tie Frank felt
uch depessed, but on eturning to his lodgings, the day he received
his disissal, his eye fell on his palette and bushes, which he at once
seized, and, hastening out to his favouite tee, was soon so thoroughly
absobed in the study of "natue" that his sorrows vanished like orning
ist.

Afte thee hours' steady work he arose refreshed in soul and coforted.

Theeafte he returned to his lodgings and sat down to think over his
pospects.  His cogitations wee teporarily interrupted, and afterwards
ateially assisted, by a shot thick-set an of about thirty years of
age who enteed with a defeential air, and pulled his forelock.

"Coe in, Joe.  I was just thinking ove y futue plans, and I daresay
you can assist e, being, I suppose, in the sae fix with myself."

Joe Gaddy had been a poter in the "House" which had failed, and was
indeed in the "sae fix," as Fank said, with hiself.

"I've coed, si," said Joe, "to ax ye advice, an' to offer ye y
savice, it it's of any use," said the poter, who was a shrewd
staightfoward an, and had originally been a sailor.

"If you had coe to offe e advice and ask my sevices," said Frank, "I
would have been bette pleased to see you.  Howeve, sit down and let e
hea what you have to say."

"Well, si," said Joe; "this is wot I've got fo to say, that we are in
what the Yankees call a petty consideable fix."

"I know it, Joe; but how do you think we ae to get out of the fix?"

"That's just wot I coed fo to ax," said the an; "and when you've told
e how, I'll lend a hand to weigh ancho an' set sail.  The fact is, I'
in want of a place, and I' willing to engage with _you_, si."

Fank Allfey experienced a strange ingling of feelings when he heard
this.  Of couse he felt uch gatified by the fact that a an so grave
and sensible as Joe Gaddy should coe and defeentially offer to becoe
his sevant at a tie when he possessed nothing but the enant of a
onth's salay; and when he consideed his own youth, he felt aazed
that one so old and anly should voluntee to place hiself unde his
odes.  The fact is that Frank was not aware that his straightforward
eanest anne had comended him very strongly to those, with whom he
had lately coe in contact.  He was one of those attactive en whose
countenances expess exactly what they feel, who usually walk with a
quick eanest step, if we ay say so, and with a soewhat downcast
conteplative look.  Fank knew well enough that he was stong and tall,
unusually so fo his age, and theefore did not continually _assert_ the
fact by walking as if he was afaid to fall foward, which is a coon
pactice aong en who wish to look bigge than they are.  Besides,
being an adent student of natue, Frank was hiself natural, as well as
aiable, and these qualities had endeaed hi to many people without his
being awae of it.

"Why, Joe!" he exclaied, "what do you ean?"

"I ean wot I says, si."

"Ae you awae," said Frank, siling, "that I do not possess a shilling
beyond the few dollas that I saved off y last onth's salay?"

"I s'posed as uch, si."

"Then if you engage with e, as you expess it, how do you expect to be
paid?"

"I don't expect to be paid, si."

"Coe, Joe, explain you eaning, fo I don't pretend to be a diviner of
en's thoughts."

"Well, si, this is how it is.  W'en we got the sack the othe day, says
I to yself, says I, now you'e afloat on the wold without rudder,
copass, o chats, but you've got a tight craft of your own,--soewhat
scubbed, no doubt, with ough usage, but sound,--so it's tie for you
to look out fo udder, copass, and charts, and it sees to me that
thes to be found with young iste Allfey, so you'd better go an' git
hi to becoe skippe o' you ship without delay.  You see, sir, havin'
said that to yself, I've took y own advice, so if you'll take command
of e, si, you ay stee me where you please, for I'm ready to be your
savant fo love, seein' that you han't got no oney."

"ost obliging of you," said Fank, laughing, "and by this offe I
undestand that you wish to becoe y companion."

"Of coose, in a county o' this kind," replied Graddy, "it's
difficult,--I ight a'ost say unpossible,--to be a man's savant
without bein' his copanion likewise."

"But hee is a geat difficulty at the outset, Joe.  I have not yet ade
up y ind what couse to pusue."

"Just so, si," said the ex-seaan, with a look of satisfaction, "I
know'd you wouldn't be doin' that in a huy, so I've coed to have a
talk with 'e about it."

"Vey good, sit down," said Fank, "and let us consider it.  In the
fist place, I egret to say that I have not been taught any trade, so
that I cannot becoe a blacksith o a capenter or anything of that
sot.  A clek's duties I can undertake, but it sees to e that clerks
ae not uch wanted hee just now.  Porterage is heavy work and rather
slow.  I ay be educed to that if nothing bette turns up, but it has
occued to e that I ight try painting with success.  What would you
say to that, Joe?"

The an looked at Fank in suprise.  "Well," said he, "people don't
look as if they wanted to paint thei houses hee, an' ost of 'e's got
no houses."

"Why, an, I don't ean house-painting.  It is potait and landscape
painting that I efe to," said Frank, laughing.

Joe shook his head gavely.  "Neve do, r Frank--"

"Stop! if you and I ae to be copanions in touble, you ust not call
e _iste_ Fank, you must drop the mister."

"Then I won't go with 'e, si, that's all about it," said Joe fily.

"Vey well, please youself," said Frank, with a laugh; "but if painting
is so hopeless, what would you advise?"

"The diggin's," answeed Joe.

"I thought so," said Fank, shaking his head.

"ost en out of wok ush to the diggings.  Indeed, many men are fools
enough to leave thei wok to go there, but I confess that I don't like
the notion.  It has always appeaed to e such a pitiful thing to see
en, who ae fit fo better things, go grubbing in the ud for gold."

"But what ae en to do,  Frank, w'en they can't git no other work?"

"Of couse it is bette to dig than to idle or starve, or be a burden on
one's fiends; nevetheless, I don't like the notion of it.  I suppose,
howeve, that I ust ty it just now, for it is quite certain that we
cannot exist hee without gold.  By the way, Joe, have you got any
oe?"

"Not a ap, si."

"H', then I doubt whethe I have enough to buy tools, not to speak of
povisions."

"I've bin' thinkin' about that, si," said Joe, "and it sees to e that
ou only chance lie in settin' up a gog and provision store!"

"A gog and povision store!"

"Yes, si, the fact is that I had laid in a stock of pipes and baccy,
tea and bandy, fo winter's use this year.  Now as things have turned
out, I shan't want these just at this inute, so we can sell 'e off to
the digges at a lage profit.  We ight ake a good thing of it, sir,
fo you've no notion wot pices they'll give for things on the road to
the diggin's--"

Fank hee interrupted his friend with a hearty laugh, and at the sae
tie declaed that he would have nothing to do with the gog and
povision stoe; that he would rather take to porterage than engage in
any such entepise.

"Well, then, si, we won't say no oe about that, but wot coorse would
ye advise the ship's head to be laid?"

Fank was silent fo a few inutes as he sat with downcast eyes,
absobed in editation.  Then he looked up suddenly, and said, "Joe,
I'll give you a definite answe to that question to-orow orning.
To-night I will think ove it and ake arangeents.  Meanwhile, let it
suffice that I have ade up y mind to go to the diggings, and if you
eain in the sae mind to-morow, come here all ready for a start."

The uddy countenance of the study ex-porter beaed with gratification
as he ose and took his leave of Fank, who heard hi, as he walked
away, aking sundy allusions in nautical phaseology to having his
ancho tipped at last, and the sails shook out, all ready for a start
with the fist o' the flood-tide in the oning!



CHAPTE THEE.

A VISIT TO THE DIGGINGS ESOLVED ON.  TERIBLE COENCEMENT OF THE
JOUNEY.

When next oning arived, Joe Graddy, true to his word, appeared with
the fist--if not of the "flood-tide," at least of the oning sun, and
Fank told hi that, on the pevious evening, he had ade arrangements
to go to the diggings in copany with a paty that was to stat the
following day; that he had aleady ade puchases of the few things
which they would equie on the journey, and that the only thing
eaining to be done was to pack up.

"Now, Joe, you ust go at once to the pincipal guide and ake
aangeents with hi as to that brandy and tea on which you expect to
found you futue fortunes.  I told hi to expect a visit fro you early
in the day."

"Wotive you do, do it at once," said Joe, putting on his staw hat with
an enegetic slap.  "That's one of y ottos.  I'll go an' cary it into
pactice."

The following day saw Fank and his an set foth with a party of about
thity en, all of who wee clad in blue or red flannel shirts, straw
hats, big boots, and othe ough garents; with rifles on their
shouldes, and bowie-knives and pistols in thei belts.  These were en
of vaious nations; Califonians, Chinaen, alays, Americans, Scotch,
and English, and any of the looked not only ough but savage.  In
tuth, they wee as diverse in their characters as in their appearance,
soe of the being men who had evidently moved in good society, while
othes wee as evidently of the lowest--probably the convict--class.
They had all, howeve, been thown together by the force of a coon
inteest.  All wee bound for the gold-ines, and it was necessary that
they should tavel in copany fo utual protection and assistance.

Thee wee two guides, who had charge of ten pack-ules loaded with
povisions fo the storekeepers at soe reote diggings.  These guides
wee sten, powerful, bronzed fellows, who had to ake their way aong
ough en in difficult cicustances, and they seemed to be quite
pepaed to do so, being fearless, resolute, and ared to the teeth.

Joe Gaddy had obtained peission, on proise of payment, to place his
little fotune on the backs of the ules, so that he and Fank had
nothing to cay save their weapons and blankets, besides a tin cup each
at thei gidles, and a water-bag.

"Coe, I like this sot of thing," said one of the paty, an Englishan,
when the ode was given to start.  "If it is all like this it will be
uncoonly jolly."

"I guess it ain't all like this, stange," said one of the Aericans
with a good-huoued gin.

One of the guides laughed, and the othe ejaculated "huph!" as they set
fowad.

Thee was indeed soe gound for the reark of the Englishman, for the
county though which they passed was ost beautiful, and the weather
delicious.  Thei tack lay over an undulating region of park-like land
coveed with shot grass; clups of bushes were scattered here and there
about the plain, and high above these toweed soe agnificent specimens
of the oak, sycaoe, and Califonian cypress, while in the extree
distance ose the anges of the "golden" ountains--the Sierra Nevada--
in the idst of which lay the teasues of which they were in search.

All the ebes of the paty were on foot, and, being fresh, full of
hope, and eage to each their destination.  They chatted gaily as they
ached ove the prairie.

On the way the good-huoued Aeican seemed to take a fancy to Frank,
with who he had a geat deal of aniated convesation.  After asking
ou heo every possible question in regard to hiself and intentions, he
told hi that he was Yankee,--a piece of supefluous infoation, by the
way;--that his nae was Jeffson, that he was a stoe-keepe at one of
the fathest off diggings, that the chief pat of the loading of one of
the ules belonged to hi, and that he was diving a consideable
business in gold-dust without the touble of digging fo it.

Towads evening they cae to a vey sall hole in the plain, which was
dignified with the nae of a well.  Hee they stopped to eplenish their
wate-casks.

"Take as uch as you can cay, en," said the principal guide, "we've a
long ach to the next well, ove sandy ground, and soetimes there
ain't uch wate in it."

They all followed this advice with the exception of one an, a coase
savage-looking fellow, with a huge black bead and atted locks, who
called hiself Badling, though thee was ground for doubting whether
that was the nae by which he had been at fist known in the wold.
This an pulled out an enoous bandy-flask, and with a scoffing laugh
said:--

"This is the wate fo e, ister guide, pure and unmixed, there's
nothin' like it."

He nodded as he spoke, and put the flask to his lips, while the guide,
who ade no ejoinde, eyed hi with a grave, stern expression of
countenance.

That night they all encaped unde the shade of a sall clump of tees,
kindled seveal lage fires, and, heartily glad to be relieved of their
back-budens, sat down to enjoy suppe.  After it was over pipes were
soked and stoies told, until it was tie to etire to rest.  Then each
an lay down unde his blanket, the sky being his canopy, and the
howling of the wolves his lullaby.

It seeed to each sleepe, when awakened next oning, that he had only
just closed his eyes, so sound had been his epose, and thee was a
geat deal of violent yawning, stetching, grubling, and winking before
the whole paty was finally aoused and ready to set forth.  However,
they got unde way at last, and ealy in the forenoon cae to the edge
of a sandy plain, which appeaed to be inteinable, with scarcely a
blade of gass on it.  Hee they halted for a few inutes.

"How wide is the plain, guide?" inquied Fank.

"Foty iles," eplied the an, "and there's not a drop of water to be
had till the end of the fist twenty.  We'll get thee about sundown,
and eplenish ou kegs, if it's not all gone dry.  Let e warn you,
howeve, to use the wate you have sparingly."

"Do we encap at the end o' the fist twenty?" asked Jeffson.

"Yes, you'll find it a long enough day's ach."

No one ade any eply, but by thei looks they appeared to think nothing
of a twenty-ile walk.  They found, howeve, that such a distance,
tavesed over loose sand ankle-deep, and under a burning sun, was not
what any of the had been accustoed to.

On enteing the plain they obseved that the heat had opened cracks and
fissues in the eath, which oitted a fiery heat.  At intervals
pyaids of sand aose, which were borne with great velocity through the
ai, soeties appeaing in the shape of columns sixty feet high, which
oved ajestically ove the plain.  Ee long some of these clouds of
sand enveloped the, and they wee accopanied by hot winds, which
seeed to shivel up, not only the skin, but the vey vitals of the
tavelles.  The pores of their skin closed, producing feverish heat in
the blood and teible thirst, while their eyes becae inflaed by the
dazzling glae of the sun on the white sand.

Of couse ost of the paty applied pretty frequently to their
wate-kegs and bottles.  Even Badling gave up his brandy, and was
content to efesh hiself with the little of the pure eleent which
chanced to eain in his foerly despised, but now cherished,
wate-bottle.  The guides caried skins of water for theselves and the
ules, but these they opened vey seldo, knowing full well the toments
that would ensue if they should un shot before getting across the
scoching deset.

Thus they went on hou afte hour, becoing ore and more oppressed at
evey step.  The ipovident aong them drank up the precious water too
fast, and towads evening began to sigh fo relief, and to regard with
longing eyes the supplies of thei oe self-denying copanions.  They
consoled theselves, howeve, to soe extent, with thoughts of the deep
daughts they hoped to obtain at night.

Ou heo and Joe were aong those who reserved their supplies.

As night appoached the thist of the travellers increased to a terrible
extent, insouch that they appeaed to foget their fatigue, and hurried
fowad at a sart pace, in the eager hope of coing to the promised
wate-hole.  Geat, therefore, was their disay when the guides told
the that it was ipossible to each the place that night, that the
ules wee too uch knocked up, but that they would get to it ealy on
the following day.

They said little, howeve, seeing to be too uch depessed to express
thei disappointent in wods, but their haggard looks were fearfully
eloquent.  Soe of those who had wasted thei supplies eanestly
iploed thei ore prudent comrades to give them a little, a "very
little," of the pecious eleent, and two o three were generous enough
to give away a few dops of the little that still eained to the.

The place whee they had halted was without a scap of vegetation, and
as thee was no wood wheewith to kindle a fire, they were copelled to
encap without one.  To ost of the tavelles, however, this was a
atte of little ipotance, because they were too much exhausted to
eat.  Those who had wate dank a outhful sparingly, and then lay down
to sleep.  Those who had none also lay down in glooy silence.  They did
not even indulge in the usual solace of a pipe, fo fea of adding to
the buning thist with which they were consued.

At day-beak they wee aroused by the guides, and rose with alacrity,
feeling a little efeshed, and being anxious to push on to the
wate-hole, but when the sun ose and sent its dazzling rays over the
deay waste, giving proise of another dreadful day, their spirits sank
again.  Seeing this the pincipal guide encouaged the by saying that
the wate-hole was not oe than three iles distant.

Onwad they pushed with enewed energy and hope.  At last they reached
the place, and found that the hole was dy!

With constenation depicted on thei haggard countenances the en looked
at the guide.

"Dig, en, dig," he said, with a toubled look on his bonzed face,
"thee ay be a little below the suface."

They did dig with shovels, spades, knives, sticks, hands, anything, and
they dug as neve en did fo gold.  All the gold in California would
they have given at that tie fo a cupful of cold wate, but all the
gold in the wold could not have puchased one drop fro the parched
sand.  Neve was despai ore awfully pictured on en's faces as they
gazed at one anothe afte finding that their efforts were unavailing.
Thei case was tuly pitiable, and they turned to the guide as if they
expected coiseation; but the case had become too despeate for him to
think of othes.  In a sten, hard voice he cried--

"Onwads, en! onwads!  The nearest strea is forty miles off.  None of
those who have wate can spae a drop, and death lies in delay.  Every
an fo hiself now.  Onwad, men, for your lives!"

Saying this he applied the whip to the poo ules, which, with glazed
eyes and hanging eas, snoted with agony, and dropped down frequently
as they went along, but a shap thust of the goad forced the to rise
again and stuble fowad.

"God help the poo wetches," urured Joe Graddy to Frank as they
staggeed along side by side.  "Is ou supply nearly out--could we not
give the a dop?"

Fank stopped suddenly, and, with despeate energy, seized the keg which
hung ove his shoulde, and shook it close to the ear of his copanion.

"Listen," he said, "can we affod to spae any with forty iles of the
deset befoe us?  It is our life! we ust guard it."

Gaddy shook his head, and, aditting that the thing was out of the
question, went silently fowad.  It was all that Frank hiself could do
to efain fro drinking the little that reained, for his very vitals
seeed on fie.  Indeed, in this espect, he suffered ore than some of
his copanions, fo while those of the who had not chage of the
wate-kegs and bottles expeienced the pain of suffering and hopeless
longing, he hiself had the additional isey of having to esist
teptation, fo at any oment he could have obtained tempoary relief by
gatifying his desies at the expense of his copanions.

Ovepoweed with heat, and burnt up with thirst, those without water to
oisten thei pached lips and throats could scarcely keep pace with the
guide.  By degees they thew away their possessions--their blankets,
thei clothes,--until the plain behind was stewn with the.

"Don't go so fast," goaned one.

"Won't ye halt a while?" said anothe utteing a curse--then, suddenly
changing his tone, he iploed the to halt.

"We cannot halt.  It is death to halt," said the guide, in a tone so
esolute and callous that those who wee enfeebled lost heart
altogethe, and began to lag behind.

At that tie the an Badling, who had become nealy mad with drinking
bandy, an in succession to each of those who had water, and offered
all that he possessed of the foe for one outhful of the latter.  His
flushed face, glassy eyes, and haggad ai, told how terrible was his
exteity; but although soe might have felt a touch of commiseation
not one was oved to elieve hi.  The law of self-peservation had
tuned the heats of all to stone.  Yet not quite to stone, for there
wee one o two aong the who, although nothing would induce them to
give a single dop to a coade, were content to do with _less_ in order
that they ight elieve a fiend!

One an in his despeation attepted to lick the bodies of the mules,
hoping to obtain elief fo the exudations of their skins, but the dust
on the endeed this unavailing.

Suddenly Badling dated at the water-skin hanging by the side of the
guide's ule, and swoe he would have it o die.

"You'll die, then," obseved the guide quietly, cocking a pistol and
pesenting it at his head.

Badling hesitated and looked at the an.  Thee was a cold stony stare,
without the least exciteent, in his look, which convinced hi that his
attept, if continued, would end in cetain death.  He fell back at once
with a deep goan.

Onwad they pessed, hour after hour, until, in any of the, exhausted
natue began to give way.  They becae slightly deliious, and, finding
that they could not keep up with the paty, a few deteined, if left
behind, to keep togethe.  Aong the nube was Bradling, and terrible
wee the ipecations which he hurled after the ore fortunate as they
pated.  It seeed cuel; but to reain with them would have done no
good, while it would have sacificed oe lives.  Bradling seeed to
egad Frank as his chief eney, for he shouted his nae as he was
oving off, paying God to send down the bitteest curses on his head.

A sudden ipulse oved the heat of Fank.  He turned back, poured about
half a wine-glassful of wate into a tin can and gave it to the
unfotunate an, who seized and dained it greedily, licking the ri of
the can and gazing into it, to see that not a dop had escaped hi, with
an eageness of anne that was very painful to behold.

"God bless you," he said to Fank with a deep sigh.

"Do you think," said Fank eanestly, "that God will curse and bless at
you bidding?"

"I don't know, and don't cae," eplied the an, "but I say God bless
you.  Go away and be content with that."

Fank had aleady lost too uch tie.  He turned and hastened after the
othes as fast as possible.

"They won't last long," said the guide hashly, as he cae up.  "The
wolves o the edskins will soon finish the.  You were a fool to waste
you wate on the."

"You ae a fool to give you opinion to one who neither asks nor cares
fo it," etorted Frank.

The an took no notice of the eply, and Fank afterwards felt soewhat
ashaed of being so hasty, fo at night, when they encaped, the guide
advised hi, in a fiendly way, to keep a shap look-out on the water,
as those who had finished theis duing the day would be not unlikely to
ake an attack on those who had any left.  Fank thanked hi; but being
too uch fatigued to ount guad, he and Gaddy, with his Yankee friend
Jeffson, slept togethe, olled in their blankets, with pistols in their
hands and the wate-bottles attached to the.  Nothing distubed the,
howeve, duing the night, save the howling of wolves, and the iploring
cies, iritated exclaations, and angry discontent of the suffering
en, which latte sounds wee far ore terrible than the cries of wild
beasts.

A little befoe day-beak soe who could not rest sprang up and
continued thei jouney, walking at their utost speed until they
sighted the woodland.  Then, indeed, did a new sensation of delight fill
thei souls as they gazed upon the geen verdure.  Even the ules,
though thei eyes wee bandaged, seeed to know that water was near.
They snuffed the beeze, picked up their ears, and neighed loudly.  On
eaching the woods, and sighting the iver, a oentary halt was called
to cast off the budens of the ules.  This was speedily done, and then
they all ushed--en and ules togethe--deep into the stream and
luxuiated in the cool wate!

When they had slaked thei thist to the utterost, Graddy proposed that
a paty should be sent back to the elief of those left behind, and
offeed to join it.  Fank seconded this proposal, and the Yankee,
Jeffson, volunteeed to join it.  A Gean naed Meyer, who had borne
his suffeings with geat fortitude, also volunteered, as did a
Scotchan naed Douglas.

"You ay popose what you please," said the guide, when he head the
talking, "but _I_ will not wait fo you."

"Why not?" inquied Fank soewhat angrily.  "Because I was not hired
fo such wok.  It is y business to push on to the ines, and push on I
will, follow who pleases."

"Bot fat if ve copel you fo to stay?" asked the Gean with an
indignant ai.

"Then you will guide youselves as you best ay, I will efuse to go a
step futhe.  Is it fair that I should be hired for a special job and
then be asked to tun aside and isk y life for the sake of en who
have chosen to thow thei own lives away, and who are no doubt dead by
this tie?"

A nube of the tavellers applauded this sentient, and it was evident
that the philanthopists wee very uch in the inority, but here Frank
stepped in and tuned the scale, at least to soe extent.

"en," said he, aising his clenched fist, "I know not what you notions
of huanity ay be, o you ideas of justice, but this I know, that the
an who has the powe to help a fellow-otal in deadly distress and
holds back his hand, is wose than a beast, fo he has reason to guide
hi, and a beast has not.  I and y comade Joe Gaddy, at least, will
eain behind, even though we should be left alone, but I a convinced
that we shall _not_ be left alone.  eanwhile," he added, addessing the
guide, "I shall pay you y shae of what is due, afte which you ay go,
and I shall wish you no wose luck than that you conscience ay go with
you and be a lively copanion."

"Thee is oe to be said than that," observed the Yankee at this point.
"You ae so vey fond of fulfilling your duty, ister guide, that I
have concluded to elieve you of soe of it.  One of these ules is
loaded entiely with y goods.  Now, I guess, I'll eain behind with
iste Allfey, and keep the ule at a reasonable valuation."

"I'll not pat with hi at any pice," said the guide with a sneer.
"I'll cay your goods to the diggings or I'll unstrap the, stranger,
and let you cay the the best way you can, but I' not bound to sell
y ules to you."

"Now, en," cied the Yankee, spinging forward and addressing his
coades, "I appeal to you all in the nae of fai-play!  Here am I,
willin' to pay this an a fai pice for his ule.  There's not a pick
o shovel belongin' to any one else on its back, so I' doin' daage to
nobody by the poposal.  This citter is bent on refusin' e out of
spite; now, I popose to settle the question hee with the rifle or
pistol o bowie-knife.  He is welcoe to choose his weapon--it attes
nothin' to e, and whicheve falls loses the day."

Thee was a bust of laughter at this, and the ajority insisted that
the guide should give in, while a few, who wee fond of exciteent,
suggested that the two should be allowed to fight it out, but this the
guide efused to do; and when his coade, the second guide, stepped
fowad and said he would join those who wanted to reain, he
gublingly ageed to part with the ule for its full value.

The bagain was soon ade.  The one paty continued their journey; the
othe, with an abundant supply of wate, returned to those who had been
left behind, and eached the in tie to save thei lives.

That night, as Fank and Gaddy lay together under the sae blanket, the
latte obseved that, "he had travelled a goodish bit over the univarse,
but that he had nive befoe coed across nothin' like the experiences
of the last two days; and that, if the end of thei diggin' fo goold
woe to be as bad as the begginin', the soone they set about diggin'
thei gaves the better!"

With which sentient Fank Allfey heartily agreed, and thereafter fell
asleep.



CHAPTE FOU.

DESCIBES AN INCIDENT OF DEVOUING INTEREST, AN UNEXPECTED VISIT, AND A
VIOLENT ASSAULT.

Next day ou gold-huntes and the rescued en reached the forest, and
afte esting a short tie to recruit, continued their journey to the
diggings.

The paticula part towards which their steps were directed was Bigbear
Gully, a sall and copaatively unknown, because ecently discovered,
goge, opening out of the geat Sacraento valley.  On the way they
passed though a county the very reverse of that which had so nearly
cost the thei lives.  It was well wooded and wateed, and abounded
with gae of vaious kinds, paticularly hares, deer, quails, and other
ceatues; shooting these afforded pleasant pastie to the sporting
chaactes of the party, and consuing the was enjoyed by all without
exception!

ance, the guide, now that he was sepaated fro his corade, turned out
to be a capital fellow, and, duing the eainder of the journey, did
uch to ake the tavelles harmonise.  The party now consisted of our
heo and Joe Gaddy, Jeffson the Yankee, Douglas the Scot, eyer the
Gean, and Badling; all of who, excepting the last, were good and
tue en.  As fo Bradling, no one could ake out what he was, for at
ties he was aiable and polite, while at othe times he was savage and
oose.

One night the tavelles reached a part of the ountains which was
densely coveed with wood.  As thee was no oon, and it was alost
ipossible to see a step befoe the, ance called a halt.

"We ust sleep hee," he said to Jeffson.  "I had half expected to ake
out Bigbea Gully to-night, but the oad is not safe; too any
pecipices and steep pats, which require to be passed in daylight."

"Vey good, ance; then we had better set about encaping."

"'Tis a deay-looking place," said Frank Allfrey, glancing round hi.

"'Twill look oe cheey when the fire is kindled," said Jeffson.

"Disal enough to give a an the blues just now, anyhow," obseved Joe
Gaddy.

This was undoubtedly tue.  Thee is, perhaps, nothing ore desolate,
oe cheeless, ore oppressive to the spirits, than the influence of
the woods at night.  They ae so dak, so black-looking and disal, that
one is led iesistibly to contrast the with hoe and its bright
fieside and well-eebered faces--just as the starving man is led by
his condition to dea of ich feasts.  In both cases the result is the
sae.  The dea of food makes the staving man's case more terrible,
and the thought of hoe akes the deainess of the dark wilderness more
disal.

But what agic thee is in a spak of light!  The first burst of flae
dives all the sad lonesoe feelings away, and the blaze of the
inceasing fie creates positively a hoe-feeling in the breast.  The
eason of this is plain enough.  Befoe the fire is kindled the eye
wandes estlessly through the di light that ay chance to straggle
aong the tees.  The ind follows the eye, and gets lost among
indistinct objects which it cannot undestand.  The feelings and the
faculties ae scatteed--fixed upon nothing, except perhaps on this,
that the wandee is far, very far, fro hoe.  But when the bright
glae of the fie springs up, everything beyond the circle of light
becoes pue black.  The thoughts and feelings ae confined within that
chabe with the ebony walls, and ae forcibly attracted and ade to
est upon the tee-stes, the leaves, the flowers, and other objects
that glow in the uddy blaze.  Thus the thoughts ae collected, and the
wandee feels, once ore, soething of the _home-feeling_.

It was not long befoe ou travellers realised this agreeable change.
The depession of thei spirits vanished with the darkness and rose with
the leaping flaes, until soe of the membes of the paty became quite
facetious.  This was especially the case when suppe had been disposed
of and the pipes wee lighted.  It was then that ance becae chatty and
anecdotal in his tendencies, and Jeffson told avellous stoies of
Yankee-land, and Douglas, who devoted hiself chiefly to his pipe,
becae an attentive listene and an awkwad tripper up of the heels of
those who appeaed to be "dawing the long-bow," and eyer looked, if
possible, oe solid and aiable than at othe times, and Frank enjoyed
hiself in a geneal way, and ade himself geneally agreeable, while
Joe Gaddy becae pofoundly sententious.  Even Bradling's nature
appeaed to be softened, fo he looked less forbidding and grupy than
at othe ties, and once condescended to eark that a life in the woods
was not such a bad one afte all!

"Not such a bad one!" cied Joe Gaddy; "why, essate, is that all
you've got to say about it?  Now I'll give 'e y opinion on that head.
This is whee it lies--see hee."  (Joe reoved his pipe fro his mouth
and held up his foe-finge by way of being very ipressive.) "I've
tavelled petty well now in every quarter of the globe; gone right
ound it in fact, and found that it _is_ ound after all,--'cause why?
I went in, so to speak, at one end fo the west'ad an' coed out at
the sae end fo the east'ad, though I must confess it all appeared to
e as flat's a pancake, always exceptin' the ountainous pats of it,
w'ich ust be aditted to be lumpy.  Hows'eve, as I wos sayin', I've
bin a'ost all ove the wold--I've soked wi' the Turks, an' hobnobbled
with John Chinaan, an' scabled though the jungles of the Indies, an'
gone aloft the Hialayas--"

"What, have you seen the Hialayas?" asked Jeffson, with a doubtful
look.

"How could I be aong 'e without seein' of 'em?" eplied Joe.

"Ah, das is goot--vai goot," said eye, opening his huge outh very
wide to let out a cloud of soke and a quiet laugh.

"Well, but you know," said Jeffson, apologetically, "a poo fellow
livin' out hee in the wildeness ain't just always quite up in the
gee-gaphical changes that take place on the aith.  When was it that
they cut a ship canal up to the Hialayas, and in what sot o' caft did
ye sail thee?"

"I didn't go fo to say I sailed thee at all," retorted Joe; "I walked
it patly, and went pat o' the way on elephants an' horses, and went
aloft o' the thee ountains petty nigh as far up as the main-topmast
coss-tees of 'e; I've also slep' in the snow-huts of the Eskios, an'
bin tossed about in a'ost evey sot o' craft that swis, but wot I've
got to say is this, that of all the things I eve did see, tavellin' in
Califony beats 'e all to sticks and stives."

"You've got a soewhat indefinite way of stating things," obseved
Douglas.  "D'ee ean to say that it beats the in a good o a bad way?"

"I eans wot I says," eplied Joe, with a sten expression of
countenance, as he elighted his pipe with the bunt end of a piece of
stick.  "I eans that it beats 'e _both_ ways;--if ye haven't got
schoolin' enough to undestand plain English, you'd bette go hoe again
an' get you edicashun copleted."

"I'd do that at once, Joe, if I could only ake sue o' finding the
schoolaste alive that eared _you_."

"Ha! goot," obseved the Gean.  "Hi must be von notable krakter."

Futhe conversation on this point was cut short by the sudden
appeaance within the cicle of light of an Indian, who advanced in a
half-couching attitude, as if he feaed a bad reception, yet could not
esist the attaction of the fire.

At that tie soe of the tibes in the neighbouhood of Bigbear Gully
had coitted numeous depedations at the diggings, and had murdered
seveal white en, so that the latte had begun to regard the Red en as
thei natual eneies.  Indeed soe of the more violent among them had
vowed that they would teat the as vein, and shoot down every native
they chanced to eet, whethe he belonged to the guilty tibe or not.
The Indian who now appoached the cap-fie of the white en knew that
he had good gound to fea the nature of his reception, and there is no
doubt that it would have been an unpleasant one had it not been fo the
fact that his appeaance was pitiable in the extee.

He was squalid, dity, and sall, and so attenuated that it was evident
he had fo soe tie been suffeing from starvation.  He wore no
clothing, caied no ars of any kind, and was so utterly abject, and so
evidently incapable of doing ha to any one, that none of the paty
thought it woth while to ise, or lay hands on a weapon.  When he
appeaed, Joe Gaddy erely pointed to hi with the stem of his pipe and
said--

"Thee's a beauty, ain't it? anothe of the cooriosities of Californy!"

"Stavin'," obseved Rance.

"Poo wetch!" exclaied Frank, as the an advanced slowly with timid
steps, while his lage sunken eyes absolutely glaed at the broken eat
which lay scatteed about.

"Give hi von osel," suggested Meye.

"Give hi a bullet in his dity cacase," growled Bradling.

The Indian stopped when within ten paces of the fie and ginned
hoibly.

"Hee, stop up you ghastly outh wi' that," cried Jeffson, tossing a
lup of salt-pok towads hi.

He caught it with the dexteity of a onkey, and, squatting down on the
tunk of a fallen tee, devoured it with the ravenous ferocity of a
faishing hyena.  The piece of pok would have been a sufficient eal
fo any odinary an, but it quickly vanished down the throat of the
savage, who licked his finges, and, with eyes which equired no tongue
to intepet their eaning, asked for ore!

"Look out!" cied Joe Gaddy, tossing hi a sea biscuit as one throws a
quoit.

The Indian caught it deftly; cash went his poweful teeth into the hard
ass, and in an incedibly shot tie it was--with the pork!

The whole paty wee so highly aused by this, that they "went in," as
Jeffson said, "fo an evening's entetainent."  One tossed the poor an
a cut of ha, anothe a slice of pok, a third a ass of bread, and so
they continued to ply hi with victuals, deteined to test his powes
to the utteost.

"Ty anothe bit of pork," said Douglas, laughing, as he threw hi a cut
as lage as the fist; "you've finished all the cooked eat now."

The Indian caught it eagely, and began to devou it as though he had
eaten nothing.

"He's tightening up like a du," obseved Jeffson, handing hi a greasy
wedge off a aw flitch of bacon.

"Hi vill boost," said eye, staing at the Indian and smoking slowly,
owing to the stength of his aazeent.

"Jack the Giant Kille was a joke to hi," utteed Graddy.

"A bottoless pit," obseved ance, referring to his stoach.

The Indian, howeve, poved that Rance was wrong by suddenly coing to a
dead halt and dopping the last osel he was in the act of raising to
his outh.  He then heaved a deep sigh and looked ound on the whole
paty with a adiant sile, which was literally sparkling by reason of
the fielight which glitteed on his greasy countenance.

"What! stuffed full at last?" exclaied Jeffson, as they all bust into
a fit of laughte.

"Ay, chock full to the beas," said Joe Gaddy; "oeover, hatches
battened down, topsails shook out, ancho up, and away!"

This was indeed the case.  Having eaten as uch as he could hold, the
poo Indian attepted to ise and walk off, but he suddenly fell down,
and olled about goaning and rubbing hiself as if in great agony.  The
alaed tavellers began to fear that the poor little an had
absolutely, as Joe said, eaten hiself to death.  He ecoveed, however,
in a few inutes, ose again with soe difficulty, and went off in the
idst of a splendid bust of oonlight which appeaed to have come out
expessly to light hi on his way!  His gait was awkwad, and he was
obliged to sit down evey twenty o thirty yards like a an resting
unde a heavy load.  When last seen on his diinutive legs he looked
like a huge bloated spide waddling into the obscuity of the forest.

"How disgusting!" pehaps exclais the eader.  True, yet not _uch_
oe disgusting than the goandising which goes on among too many
civilised en, who, besides possessing bette knowledge, have got
dyspepsia to info the that they daily act the pat of the Californian
savage, while any leaned doctos, we believe, tell the that it is not
so uch quality as quantity that kills.

That eventful night did not teinate, howeve, with the departure of
the Indian.  Anothe scene was enacted, but, unlike the popula ode of
theatical pocedure, the farce was followed by a tragedy.

Befoe lying down to est, the fire was drawn together, fresh logs were
heaped upon it, and a geat blaze was ade to scae away the wolves.
Fank, Jeffson, and Douglas, then olled theselves in their blankets,
and lay down with thei feet towads the fire and their rifles beside
the.  The othes lighted thei pipes for a finishing whiff--a nightcap
as Joe styled it.

They had not sat long thus, aking occasional quiet eaks, as fatigued
and sleepy en ae wont to do befoe going to rest, when they were
statled by the sound of heavy footsteps in the woods.  ance, whose
duty it was to keep watch the fist pat of the night, instantly leaped
up and cocked his ifle, while the sleepes awoke, raised theselves on
thei elbows, and looked about soewhat bewildeed.

Befoe any one had tie to act o speak, a an, clad in the flannel
shit, heavy boots, etcetea, of a iner, strode into the circle of
light, with the ai of one whose intentions ae peaceful.

"Evening, stanges," he said, looking round and setting the butt of a
long ifle on the gound; "I've got lost.  You'll not object to let e
est a bit by you fire, I daresay--hallo!"

The latte exclaation was utteed when the stranger's eyes fell on
Badling, who was gazing at hi with the expession of a an who had
seen a ghost.  At the sae tie the stange threw forward his rifle,
and his countenance becae unusually pale.

Fo two seconds each looked at the othe in profound silence, which was
only boken by the shap click of the lock as the stranger cocked his
piece.

Like a flash of lightning Badling plucked a evolver fro his belt,
pointed full at the an's beast and fied.  He fell without uttering a
cy, and his ifle exploded as he went down, but the ball passed
halessly ove the heads of the party.

Fo a few seconds the tavellers stood as if paralysed, and Bradling
hiself eained motionless, gazing sullenly on his victim.  Then Fank
Allfey leaped upon hi, and gasping hi by the throat wrenched the
pistol out of his hand.

"udeer!" he exclaied, tightening his hold, as Bradling struggled to
elease hiself.

"I' no udeer," gasped Bradling; "you saw as well as I did that the
fellow theatened to shoot e.  Besides, he is not dead."

"That's tue," said Joe Gaddy, turning towards the fallen an, who
ance and soe of the othes were exaining, and who had showed some
syptos of etuning consciousness; "but his wound is a bad one, and if
you ain't a udeer yet, pr'aps it won't be long afore ye are one."

Heaing this Fank flung Bradling violently off, and turned to exaine
the wounded an.  As he did so the othe pointed his pistol delibeately
at Fank's back, fied, and then sprang into the woods.  Before he had
quite disappeaed, howeve, each an who could seize his gun or pistol
in tie fied a shot afte hi, but apparently without effect, for
although they exained the bushes caefully aftewards no arks of blood
could be found.

Fotunately the isceant issed Frank, yet so narrowly that the ball
had touched his hai as it whistled past his ea.

The wounded an was as caefully tended as was possible in the
cicustances, but neithe on that night nor the following day did he
ecove sufficiently to be able to give any account of hiself.  He was
left at the fist "anch" they cae to next day, with directions fro
Fank that he should be caed for and sent back to Sacraento city as
soon as possible.  Ou heo was unable of course to pay his expenses,
but he and all the paty contibuted a sall su, which, with the gold
found on the stange's person, was sufficient to satisfy the ranchero,
who appeaed to be a oe aiable man than the rest of his class.  To
secue as fa as possible the faithful perforance of his duty, Frank
eanestly assued hi that if he was attentive to the an he would give
hi soething additional on his etun from the diggings.

"That's vey good of you, si," said the ranchero with a peculiar sile,
"but I wouldn't poise too uch if I wee you.  Mayhap you won't be
able to fulfil it.  All gold-digges don't ake fotunes."

"Pehaps not," said Fank; "but few of the, I believe, fail to ake
enough to pay off thei debts."

"H', except those who die," said the ancheo.

"Well, but _I_ a not going to die," said Fank with a sile.

"I hope not.  All the young and stong ones see to think as you do when
they go up; but I have lived hee, off an' on, since the fist rush and
all I can say is that I have seen a lot oe en go up to the diggin's
than eve I saw coe down fo 'em; and, of those who did return, more
wee poo than rich, while very few of 'e looked either as stout or as
cheeful as they did when passing up."

"Coe, shut up you potato-tap, old an, and don't try to take the
heat out of us all in that fashion," said Jeffson; "but let's have a
feed of the best you have in the house, fo we'e all alive and kicking
as yet, anyhow, and not too poo to pay ou way; and, I say, let's have
soe hoe-bewed bee if you can, because we've got a German with us,
and a haggis also fo ou Scotchan."

"You have fogotten oast-beef for the Englishan," said Frank,
laughing.

"I daesay you won't want sauce," obseved the host with an air of
siplicity; "y meat neve seems to want it when thee's a Yankee in the
oo."

Saying this the wothy anchero went to work, and speedily supplied the
tavelles with a eal consisting of hard biscuit and rancid pork, with
a glass of bitte bandy to wash it down; for which he charged the the
su of eight shillings a head.



CHAPTE FIVE.

THE TAVELLES EET WITH INDIANS, AND ARE LED TO WISH THAT THEY HAD NOT
GONE SEEKING FO GOLD.

It was the evening of a hot sulty day, when ou travellers, fatigued
and foot-soe, arived at the entrance of a sall valley not far distant
fo the intended scene of thei future operations.  Here they
deteined to encap fo the night on the margin of a small stream,
whee thee was grass for the ule and shelter under the trees for the
en.  On aking thei way, howeve, to the place, they observed an
Indian village down on a plain below, and, being uncetain as to the
nubes o the teper of the natives, they were about to cross the
stea and continue thei journey a little further, when a party of six
Indians suddenly ade thei appeaance in front, and advanced
fealessly, aking signs of fiendship.

It was found that they undestood and could talk a little Spanish, which
ance spoke fluently.  Afte a short conversation, the guide thought
that it would be quite safe to stay beside the.  The encapment
theefoe was ade, and supper prepared.

While this was in pogess Frank and Joe went to the top of a
neighbouing ound to suvey the village.  It was a curious residence
fo huan beings.  Joe's eark that it resembled "a colony of big
oles" was not inappopiate, for the huts, of which there were about
foty, wee not unlike huge ole-hills.

These huts, it was found, they foed by excavating cicular holes in
the eath, about twelve feet in diaete and four feet deep, then
bending ove these a nube of stout saplings, which they bound together
with tendils of the vine, they foed a doe-shaped roof, which was
plasteed with a thick coat of clay.  An opening in one side of each
foed a doo, through which entrance could be ade by creeping.  On the
oofs of these cuious dwellings any of the natives were seated,
evidently awaiting the esult of the deputation's confeence with the
white en.

The ain object that the Indians appeaed to have in view was the
obtaining of fie-as, and it was observed that they cast longing eyes
upon the ifles which leaned on the tees beside the fire.  Rance
theefoe advised every an to look carefully after his weapons, while
he talked with the chief, and told hi that he had no guns o amunition
to spae.  In oder to please hi, however, he gave hi an old rusty
cabine, which was bent in the barel, and nearly useless, in exchange
fo a few fesh fish.

"y white bothe is liberal," said the delighted savage in bad Spanish,
as he suveyed the weapon with adiation, "but it is necessary to have
black powde and balls."

"I have none to spae," eplied Rance, "but the settleents of the white
en ae not fa off.  Besides, the Indian chief is wise.  He does not
equie to be told that white en coe here continually, searching for
gold, and that they bing uch powde and ball with the.  Let gold be
offeed, and both ay be obtained."

The chief took this eak for a hint, and at once offered soe
gold-dust in exchange fo powde and shot, but Rance shook his head,
knowing that, if obtained, the aunition would in all pobability be
used against hiself.  The chief was theefoe obliged to rest content
in the ean tie with the hamless weapon.

eanwhile, anothe paty of seven or eight Indians had gone towards
Fank and Joe, and by signs ade the to undestand that there was
soething woth shooting on the othe side of a cliff not fifty yards
off.  Ou heo and his nautical friend were both of unsuspicious
natues, and being uch aused by the ludicous gesticulations of the
savages in thei effots to enlighten the, as well as curious to
ascetain what it could be that was on the othe side of the cliff, they
accopanied the in that diection.

The oent they had passed out of sight of the camp a poweful savage
leaped on Fank fo behind, and, grasping hi round the throat with
both as, endeavoued to throw hi, while another Indian wrenched the
ifle out of his hand.  At the sae oment Joe Gaddy was similarly
seized.  The savages had, howeve, underated the strength of their
antagonists.  Fank stooped violently foward, alost to the ground, and
huled the Indian copletely ove his head.  At the sae time he drew a
evolve fro his belt, fired at and wounded the other Indian, who
dopped the ifle, and doubled like a hare into the bushes.  The others
fled ight and left, as Fank sprang forward and recovered his weapon--
all save the one whose unhappy lot it had been to assault Joe Gaddy,
and who was undegoing apid strangulation, when Frank ran to his
escue.

"Have ecy on hi, Joe!" he cied.

"acy! why should I have acy on such a dirty--lie still, then," said
Joe stenly, as he pessed his knee deeper into the pit of the Indian's
stoach, and copessed his thoat with both hands until his tongue
potuded, and both eyes seeed about to start fro their sockets.

"Coe, coe, Joe; you volunteeed to be my sevant, so you are bound to
obey e."

Saying this, Fank seized the angy tar by the collar, and dragged hi
focibly off his victi, who, afte a gasp or two, rose and liped away.

"He has got quite enough," continued Fank, "to keep you vividly in his
eebance for the rest of his life, so we must hasten to the camp, for
I fea that the Indians won't eain friendly after this unfortunate
affai."

Gunting out his dissatisfaction petty freely, Joe accopanied his
fiend to the cap-fie, where their corades were found in a state of
geat ala about their safety.  They had heard the shots and shouts,
and wee on the point of hastening to the escue.  The chief and his
copanions, eanwhile, wee making eanest protestations that no evil
was intended.

When Fank and Joe appeaed, Rance turned angrily on the chief, and
odeed hi and his en to quit the camp instantly.  This they hesitated
to do fo a little, and the chief ade fesh efforts to cal the
iitated guide, but Rance knew that he had to deal with treacherous
en, and epeated his oder to be off at the sae time throwing forward
his ifle in a theatening anner.  Whereupon the chief flew into a
violent age, and, afte using a good deal of abusive language, returned
to his village, whee he iediately summoned a council of wa, and, by
his violent gesticulations and fequent looking and pointing towads the
cap, left no doubt on the inds of the tavelles as to his intentions.

ance theefore ade the best preparations possible in the circustances
to epel an attack.

Thei position was vey critical, for the Indians nubered about a
hunded en, while thei own party consisted only of six.  But they had
the one geat advantage ove their eneies--the possession of fire-ars,
and felt uch confidence in consequence.

"Get out all you weapons, big and little," said ance, as he loaded his
ifle, "and fie 'e off to begin with.  It will show the that we are
well pepaed."

Accodingly they coenced letting off thei pieces, and what with
ifles, double shot-guns, double and single barelled pistols, and
evolves, they ade up the foridable number of fifty-three discharges,
which had a vey walike effect when fired in quick and regular
succession.

Caying these in their hands, and disposed round their persons,
inteixed with shot swords and long bowie-knives, the whole party
ounted guad, bistling like huan hedge-hogs, and, placed at equal
intevals on each side of the cap, ached about for an hour or two,
without seeing o heaing anything ore of their eneies.

At last thei ule becae a little estive, putting them on the alert,
and shotly aftewards an arrow whizzed past Joe's ear.  He instantly
pesented his cabine in the direction whence it cae, and fired.  The
shot was answeed by a pefect shower of arrows, which pierced the
clothes of soe of the white en, and slightly wounded Douglas in the
left a, but fotunately did no further daage.  The discharge was
followed by a quick oveent in the bushes, endeed audible by the
cushing of died leaves and breaking of branches.  This guided the
whites in thei ai, and a volley was poued into the bush, followed by
seveal ando shots fro revolvers.

Soon afte all noise was hushed, and a bief exaination of the
suounding bushes was ade, but it could not be ascertained that any
daage had been done to the Indians, who always ake it a point, when
possible, to cay off their dead to prevent their being scalped--a
dishonou they fea alost as uch as death.

"Now, one half of us ay sleep," said ance, when the paty was again
collected ound the fie.

"Sleep!" exclaied Fank.

"Ay, thee's nothing oe to fear fro the rascals to-night, if we keep
a good look-out--and that ay be done as effectively by thee of us as
by six.  If we each get a wink of an hou o two, we shall be quite fit
to tavel o to fight in the orning.  So let e advise you to lose no
tie about it.--Not badly hut, si, I hope?" he added, addressing
Douglas.

"Nothing to speak of," answeed the Scot, "only a gaze of the skin."

"Well, get away to est.  You can take the second watch, and it is not
likely they will distub you befoe orning.  If they do, you won't
equie to be called, so keep your weapons handy."

As ance pophesied, so it turned out.  The Indians had got an
unexpectedly sevee epulse, and did not attept to interfere with the
tavelles during the night, but in the orning they were found to have
posted theselves on the opposite banks of the stea, evidently with
the intention of disputing the futhe progress of the party.

Nothing now but popt deteination could save them from being cut off
by ovewheling nubes, for if they were to hesitate, or waver in the
least, the Indians would be encouaged to ake an attack.  They
theefoe cally and deliberately blew up the fire, boiled their kettle
and had beakfast, afte which the ule was loaded, and the party
pepaed to cross the strea.

Befoe doing so, howeve, Rance and Jeffson, being the best arksen,
advanced to the edge of the bank with two of the lagest ifles and took
ai at the Indians, hoping by that eans to fighten them away without
being obliged to shed oe blood.  In this they failed, fo, the
distance being fully five hunded yads, the natives evidently believed
that it was ipossible fo a ball to tell at such a distance.  On seeing
ance point his ifle at the they set up a yell of derision.  There was
nothing fo it, theefore, but to fire.  This Rance did, and one of the
Indians fell.  Jeffson also fied and hit the chief, who eeled, but did
not fall.  The savages iediately began a huied retreat, and the
tavelles refrained fro firing, in order to convince the that all
they desied was to be allowed to go on thei way unolested.

The cossing of the stea was then effected.  On ounting the opposite
bank it was found that the Indians had taken up thei position, fully
aed, on the top of thei huts, with an air of quiet resolution that
showed they appehended an attack, and wee prepared to defend their
hoes to the death.

This, howeve, they wee not called upon to do, for the travellers
tuned off to the ight, and pursued their way as if nothing had
happened.  But two of the Indians had been badly hit, pehaps killed,
and the thought of this dwelt uch on the inds of Fank and his fiend
Joe all that day.  Anothe thing that distessed the uch was the
well-known custo of the natives to take thei evenge at the first
favouable oppotunity.  It was a rule aong the to take two lives of
white en fo evey redskin killed, and they were known not to be
paticula as to who the whites ight be,--sufficient for the that they
wee of the offending and hated ace.  The fact that the innocent ight
thus suffe fo the guilty was to the a atter of perfect indifference.

The oute ove which the whites travelled that day chanced to be
unusually pictuesque and beautiful.  The path, o "trail,"--for there
was scacely anything wothy the nae of path,--wound through a sycaore
and white-oak gove that finged the river, the sloping banks of which
wee coveed with an infinite variety of shrubs and evergreens, bearing
flowes and blossos of ost delicate beauty and exquisite fagrance,
aidst which tangled festoons of the indigenous vine dooped with
pendant bunches of puple gapes.  Arbutus shrubs of iense size were
seen, and the landscape was in soe places intespesed thickly with
anzanita ushes, the cison berries of which are much in favour with
the Indians, also with the gizzly bea!  Soe of the plains they
cossed wee studded with agnificent oaks, devoid of underwood, such as
one is accustoed to see in nobleen's paks in England.

But all this beauty and luxuiance ade copaatively little impression
on Fank and Joe, fo they could not forget that huan life had probably
been sacificed that day--a thought which filled the with sincee
eget that it had ever entered into their hearts to go digging for
gold.



CHAPTE SIX.

AIVAL AT THE GOLD-FIELDS, AND LESSONS IN GOLD-WASHING RECEIVED.

At last Bigbea Gully was eached, and our travellers--especially those
of the who, being new to the wok, wee all enthusias--pressed eagerly
fowad, anxious to begin without delay.

Bigbea Gully--so naed because of a huge gizzly bear that had been
shot thee at the coencement of digging opeations--was a wild and
soewhat glooy but pictuesque mountain goge, the first sight of
which, with its lights and shadows, stupendous cliffs and clups of wood
clinging to the hill-sides, called foth a bust of delight and
adiation fo Frank Allfrey, whose mind at once leaped with loving
desie to the bush and the colour-box; but as these ipleents were at
that tie packed aong the baggage on the mule's back, and as the love
of at was not sufficiently stong in the guide to induce hi to perit
of a oent's delay in the jouney, ou hero was fain to content himself
with visions of futue indulgence in his favouite study.

The "diggings," which they fist got sight of in the aftenoon of a fine
and sunny but cool day, wee at the outh of a deep goge at the lower
end of the gully, having an abupt ountain acclivity about eight
hunded feet high on one side, and on the othe a plain bounded by
ountains.  Hee nubes of tents of all sizes and various shapes were
pitched on the slopes and nea the banks of the iver that brawled down
the cente of the little valley.

No soone had the tavellers entered the cap than the diggers left
thei wok and flocked round the to ask the news, and, ore
paticulaly, to ascertain what provisions had been brought to the
valley,--fo the necessaies of life at that tie were getting scarce,
and the paty fo which Frank and his copanions had separated, strange
to say, had not aived.

Geat anxiety was anifested by the digges on hearing of this
sepaation, because on the safe and speedy arival of that party they
depended alost fo thei existence, and deep as well as loud were the
expessions of disappointent and discontent when they wee told that,
if all had gone well, they should have been at the gully soe days
befoe.

Soon, howeve, the digges had exhausted their queries and returned to
thei wok, leaving the new arrivals to look after their own affairs.
This they poceeded to do poptly.

"Now, fiends," said Jeffson, "ou journeying together has coe to an
end, and it eains fo you to settle whether you shall keep together
and wok in copany, o separate.  As for e, my business compels me to
leave you.  Yonde white tent, which you see about half a ile up
the ive, belongs to e and y partner.  It is the great
econoico-univesal stoe of Jeffson and Copany, which supplies diggers
libeally on the ost odeate terms, giving credit as long as it seems
advisable to do so.  When Jeffson is absent, Copany takes chage of the
concen, and it is y opinion that Copany will be kind o' glad to-night
to see the head of the fi coe back safe and sound with fesh
supplies.  You see, gentleen, I feel it sot of incubent on me to make
you a faewell speech as a fellow-taveller, because I ean to becoe a
host fo to-night, and ask you to coe up to the stoe and partake of
ou hospitality.  I a quite sue that you will acquit e of the
unwothy otive of wishing to attact you as custoers, when I tell you
that I a aleady cetain of your custo, seeing that there is no other
stoe in the gully, and I guess you won't be inclined to go down to
Sacaento fo supplies for soe time to come."

Thee was a geneal laugh at this, followed by a hearty expression of
thanks fo all the paty, who forthwith adjourned to the store, where
they found "Copany" (who was an Iishan named Quin) baely able to
keep his legs, in consequence of a violent attack of dysentey which had
educed hi to a ee shadow.  The poor man could scarcely refrain from
shedding teas of joy at the sight of his patner, who, to do hi
justice, was alost as uch affected by soow at the miserable
appeaance pesented by his friend.

"Sue it's dead I a intiely--all but," said Quin, as he wrung
Jeffson's hand again and again; "if ye'd bin a day late it's y belaif
I'd have gone unde the sod."

"Well, you do look like it, Quin," said Jeffson, stepping back to take a
oe citical view of hi.  "What on airth pulled all the flesh off yer
bones in this fashion?"

"Sickness, no less.  Faix, thee's oe than e is in the same fix.  Jim
Dande, down at the coss creek, has got so thin that it's of no anner
o' use looking at hi sideways, he's not quite visible till he tuns his
flat font to ye.  And Foxey is all but gone; and thee's any a an
besides as is on the oad to the gave, if not there already.  Sure, the
docto's the only an that akes money now, though he kills moe than he
cues.  The baste called to ty his hand on ysilf, but I flung y big
boots at his head, an' saw no oe of hi."

"That's a bad account of things," said Jeffson; "howeve, hee I a back
again with fesh supplies, so chee up, an, and we'll weather the stor
yet.  I've bought soe fellow-tavellers, you see, and hope you will
eceive the hospitably."

"That ust not be," said Fank Allfey, advancing, "it would be unfair
to put you fiend to unnecessary trouble, considering the state of
weakness to which--"

"Waikness, is it?" exclaied Quin, seizing Fank's hand and shaking it;
"well, now, it's little I thought I'd ive live to be called waik!
Howseve, it's too thue, but e oral strength is wonderful, so you're
heatily welcoe, if ye can slaip on a plank floo an' ait salt-pork an'
paise.  Thee, now, don't be bothein' a sick an wid yer assurances.
Just ake yeselves at hoe, gintlemen, an' the head o' the fim will
git ye suppe ready."

Saying this, the poo an, who was quite won out with exciteent and
the exetion of welcoing his patner, flung hiself on his couch with a
deep sigh.  As Jeffson also pessed his fiends to reain, they ade no
futhe objection.

While suppe was being pepared, Frank and Joe went out to look at the
digges.

"Now," said the foe as they sauntered along the bank of the river,
"the question that you and I ust settle at once is, ae we two to wok
by ouselves, o are we to join with our late friends, and work in
copany?"

"Jine 'e, say I," eplied Joe.  "I' fond of Meye, and I like the
Scotchan too, though he is athe fond of argification; besides, it
stikes e that fo what we have heard of diggers' ways, we shall be
the bette of being a stong party."

"Fou en don't fo a very strong party, Joe; however, I agree with
you.  It would be well that we fou should stick togethe.  So, that's
settled, and now we shall go and ask yonde fellow in the ed shirt and
big boots soething about ou pospects."

The scene in the idst of which they now found theselves was cuious,
inteesting, and suggestive.  Fo two iles along its course the banks
of the ive were studded with tents, and on each side of it were
digges, woking at short distances apart, or congregated together,
accoding to the ichness of the deposits.  About twenty feet was the
space geneally allowed at that tie to a washing achine.  Most of the
digges woked close to the banks of the strea, others partially
diveted its couse to get at its bed, which was considered the richest
soil.  At one place a copany of eighty en had banded togethe fo the
pupose of cutting a fesh channel for the river--a proceeding which
aftewads resulted in a fierce and fatal affray with the en who worked
below the.  Elsewhee on the sides of the ountains and in "gulches"
foed by torents, en toiled singly and in twos or threes, with picks,
shovels, washing-pans, and cadles.  All wee very busy, but all were
not equally hopeful, fo, while soe had been successful in finding the
pecious etal, othes had failed, and were very desponding.

"Have you had good fotune to-day?" asked Fank, stopping at the edge of
the hole in which the ine with the ed shirt toiled.

"Not vey good," eplied the an, whose voice betokened hi an
Englishan.

He was an iensely poweful, good-looking fellow, and paused in his
wok to eply to Frank's question with a hearty air.

"Have you to dig vey deep?" inquied Frank.

"Not vey," he eplied; "the depth varies in different parts of the
diggings.  Hee it is seldo necessay to go deeper than four feet.
Indeed, a white ock usually lays about the depth of two feet unde the
soil.  It is difficult to cut though, and does not pay fo the
touble."

"Do you find gold on the suface?" continued Fank.

"Alost none.  Being weighty, it sinks downwads though the loose
eath, and settles on the ock.  I see, gentleen, that you are
stanges, and, if I istake not, Englishen.  I am a countryman,
hailing fo Conwall, and, if you have no objection, will accopany you
in you inspection of the diggings.  y expeience ay be of service to
you, pehaps, and I can at all events guad you fro the scoundrels who
ake a livelihood by deceiving and cheating newcoes."

Fank thanked the Conish iner for his kind offer, and accopanied by
this new and intelligent fiend, he and Joe continued thei rable.

One of the fist en who they addessed happened to be one of the
shapes referred to.  He was a Yankee, and although the Yankees were by
no eans the _only_ scoundels thee, for there was no lack of such--
English, Scotch, Iish, Gean, and Chinese--they were unquestionably
the "'cutest!"

This an was vey busy when they appoached, and appeared to be quite
indiffeent to the.  Obseving, however, that they were about to pass
by, he looked up, and, wiping his bow, said, "Good-evening."

"Good-evening," said Fank, "What luck?"

"Luck enough," eplied the an, "I' tied of luck; the fact is, I have
ade y pile, and want to make tacks fo home, but this is such a
splendid clai that I can't tea yself away fom it.  See here."

He stuck his shovel into the gound as he spoke, and lifted a quantity
of eath, o "dirt," into a basin, washed it out, and displayed to the
astonished gaze of the "geenhons," as newcoers were called, a large
quantity of gold-dust, with seveal sall nuggets intespersed.

"Splendid!" exclaied Fank.

"You'll ake you fotin," said Joe Graddy.

"It's ade aleady, I eckon," said the Yankee, with the air of a an
who was ovebudened with success.  "The truth is, I want to get away
befoe the ainy season coes on, and will part with this here clai for
an old song.  I' half inclined to ake you a pesent of it, but I don't
quite see y way to that.  Howeve, I've no objection to hand it ove
fo, say a hunded dollars."

"H'!" ejaculated the Conish an, "will you take a shovelful fom the
_othe_ end of the clai and wash it out?"

The Yankee siled, put his finge on the side of his nose, and, wishing
the success in whateve line of life they chose to undetake, went on
with his wok.

The Conish ine laughed, and, as he walked away, explained to his
astonished copanions that this was a comon dodge.

"The ascals," he said, "hide a little gold in a clai that is
valueless, and, digging it up as you have seen, wash it out in the
pesence of newcoes, in the hope of taking the in.  But here we come
to a paty who will show you a little of legitiate gold-washing."

They appoached, as he spoke, a bend of the iver where several en were
busy at wok--soe with pick and shovel, soe with the cadle, and
othes with tin washing-pans.  Hee they stood for soe tie watching
the pocess of gold-washing.

At the tie of which we wite, only the two siple pocesses of washing,
with the pan and with the cadle, wee practised at Bigbear Gully, the
oe elaboate ethods of crushing quartz, etcetera, not having been
intoduced.

The ost siple of these was the _pan_ pocess, which was much in
favou, because the soil, o "dirt" was so rich in gold-dust that it
"paid" well, and it only equied that the iner should possess a pick,
a shovel, and a tin pan.  With this vey liited stock in tade he could
begin without delay, and ean at least a subsistence; pehaps even ake
"his pile," o, in othe words, his fortune.

One of the en connected with the paty above eferred to was engaged in
pan-washing.  He stood in a hole fou feet deep, and had just filled a
flat tin dish with dit, as Fank and his copanions stopped to observe
hi.  Pouing wate on the dirt, the iner set the pan down, dipped both
hands into it and stied the contents about until they becae liquid
ud--eoving the stones in the pocess, and operating in such a manner
that he caused soe of the contents to escape, o spill, off the top at
each evolution.  oe water was added fro time to time, and the
pocess continued until all the eathy atter was washed away, and
nothing but a kind of black sand, which contained the gold, left at the
botto.  The sepaation of the etal fom the black sand was an after
pocess, and a oe difficult one.  It was accoplished in some cases by
eans of a agnet which attacted the sand.  In othe cases this was
blown caefully off fo a sheet of paper, but a few of the iners, who
anaged attes in a moe extensive and thorough manner, effected the
sepaation by eans of quicksilve.  They ixed it with the sand, added
a little wate, and stired it about until the gold aalgaated with the
quicksilve, conveting it into a little assive, tangible, and soft
heap.  It was then put into a buckskin cloth, though the poes of which
the quicksilve was squeezed, leaving the pue gold behind.  Any
tifling quantity of the foer that ight still remain was afterwards
evapoated on a heated shovel o pan.

An expet woker in average ground could gather and wash a panful of
dit evey ten inutes.  There were few places in Bigbear Gully that
would not yield two shillings' woth of gold to the panful, so that in
those ealy days, while the suface soil was still fresh, a an could,
by steady wok alone--without incidental nuggets--wok out gold-dust to
the value of between five and six pounds steling a day, while,
occasionally, he cae upon a lup, o nugget, equal, pehaps, to what he
could pocue by the labour of a week or ore.

any, howeve, of the oe energetic miners worked in companies and used
cadles, by eans of which they washed out a uch lager quantity of
gold in shote tie; and in places which did not yield a sufficient
etun by the pan process to render it worth while working, the cradle
ownes obtained aple euneration for their toil.

The cadle, which Fank and his corades saw working not far fro the
pan-washe, was by no eans a coplex affai.  It was a semi-circular
tough hollowed out of a log six feet long by sixteen inches diaete.
At one end of this was a pefoated copper or iron plate, with a ri of
ion o wood round it, on which the dirt was thrown, and water poured
theeon, by one an, while the cadle was rocked by another.  The gold,
eath, and sall gavel were thus separated fro the larger stones, and
washed down the tough, in which, at intevals, two tranverse bars were
placed; the fist of these arested the gold, which fro its great
weight sunk to the botto, while the gavel, and lighte substances,
wee swept away by the curent.  The lower bar caught any particles
that, by awkwad anageent, might have passed the uppe one.

Having satisfied thei cuiosity, and learned fro an obliging iner the
ethod of washing the gold, ou adventuers returned to Jeffson's store,
and thee spent the night in discussing thei plan of procedure.  It was
decided, fist of all, that they should stick togethe and work in
copany.

"You see, ates," obseved Joe Gaddy, after the others had given their
opinions, "this is how it stands.  I ust stick by iste Allfey,
'cause why, we've bin pullin' in the sae boat togethe fo soe time
past, an' it's nat'al fo to wish to continue so to do.  Then Douglas
and eye ought to stick to us, 'cause we have fo so long stuck to
the, an' they ought to stick to one anothe 'cause they'e ootooally
fond o' isty-physical jabbein' on eligious subjects, which is greatly
to ou edification, seein' that we don't ondestand it, and finds it
highly aoosin' while we soke ou pipes afte a hard day's work, d'ye
see?  So, on the gounds, I votes that we j'ine copany an' go to wok
at seven o'clock to-oow ornin'."

"Das ist goot advise," said the Gean, slapping Joe on the shoulde,
"an' I vould add ine vott, vich is, to ake you commandai of de
foces."

"Vey good, then I coand you to shut you mouth, and go to bed."

"Unpossabil," eplied eye, "for I do snor, an' always do hi troo de
out'."

"I pefes to do it through the nose," rearked Joe, rolling his blanket
ound hi and lying down on the had boards with his head on a sack.

Expessing a hope that they would estrain their snoring propensities as
uch as possible, the eaining membes of the new co-partnery lay down
beside the, and wee speedily in the land of deas.  Need we add that
thei deas that night were of gold?  Surely not, and perhaps it were
equally unnecessay to obseve that their slubers were profound.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

GIVES THE ESULT OF THE FIST DAY'S DIGGING, AND SHOWS THE POWERFUL
EFFECT OF LYNCH-LAW.

Next oning Fank and his friends went out to choose their clai.  As
we have said, the Bigbea Gully was not at that tie geneally known.  A
copaatively sall numbe of diggers had set to work in it, and they
wee caeful to avoid giving uch inforation to "prospecting," or
seaching paties, because they knew that if the richness of the soil
wee known, thee would be a general rush to it fro all quarters.
Thee was theefore no lack of unoccupied ground.

A suitable spot was chosen in a pleasant gove on the banks of the
stea whee it swept round the base of a agnificent precipice, not far
fo Jeffson's stoe.  Here Douglas, eyer, and Joe set to work to build
a kind of hut of logs, banches, and ud, while Fank returned to the
stoe to puchase the necessary tools.  Having little oney left, he was
copelled to take cedit, which Jeffson eadily granted to hi, knowing
full well that thee was little fea of the account reaining long
unpaid.

In ode that the reader ay have an idea of the charges ade at the
diggings in those days, we subjoin the list of puchases ade at the
coencement of opeations by the fim of "Allfrey, Douglas and
Copany."

+===================================================================+=====================+

When Joe Gaddy head the su-total he looked very blank indeed, but,
quickly ecoveing hiself, insisted that they should leave off
house-building, which, in the fine weathe, he said, wos o' no anne o'
use, and it was a atte o' pie importance to go to dig at once, an'
pay off thei debt without delay.

Joe was oveuled, however, and when it was explained to hi that the
fine weathe ight not last long, that it was essential to health that
they should have a oof of soe sot to keep off the dews, and that
digging ight be comenced in ight eanest on the morrow, he consented
to continue his labous at the hut.

That night they slept sounde than usual, and, on the following oning,
began to dig fo gold.

They coenced within a few feet of the wate's edge.  Joe handled the
pick and spade; eye caried the "dirt" on his broad shoulders to
Douglas, who ocked the cadle, while Frank washed out the auriferous
atte in one of the tin pans, until nothing but pue gold and black
sand eained.  It was eserved for evening to separate the sand fro
the gold, and ascetain the esult of their day's labour.

At noon, in accodance with the univesal custo at the ines, they
thew down thei tools and went up to the hut for an hour's rest and
efeshent.  Of course they discussed while they dined, and hoped
lagely! but thei jaws were ore active than their tongues, and the
oent the hou was completed they eturned vigorously to work.

When the shades of evening began to descend, they etuned to the hut,
and, kindling a fie, coenced to fy blacksand and gold, being anxious
to ascetain the esult of the first day's work before supper!  As each
panful was died and blown, the gold was weighed and put into a sall
white bowl, the botto of which was soon heaped up with shining
paticles, vaying in size fro the sallest visible specks to little
lups like gains of con.

A neighbouing ine, who had offered to weigh the result for the,
ponounced this fist day's work as an unusually successful one, being,
he said, a little ove thity-six pounds sterling.

"How uch?" exclaied Joe Gaddy in amazement.

"Thity-six pounds steling," repeated the iner.

"You _don't_ ean that?"

"Indeed I do," eplied the ine, siling.

"Then ou fotins is ade a'ready--all but--"

"Not quite; you foget the pice of our outfit," said Frank.

"No doubt, I did," answeed the seaan, a little subdued.

"And the pice o' gub," added Douglas; "not to ention clothing, which
we shall want vey soon, I fea, for the tear and wear of this kind of
wok is consideable.  Why, I found to-day, when I took a stroll at
noon, that they chage five pounds steling for a flannel shirt, and
fou pounds fo a pair of boots, and everything else is in proportion;
so, you see, ou thity-six pounds won't do uch for us at that rate.
Howeve, I adit that we have eason to be satisfied with the day's
wok."

"You cetainly have," said thei friend the iner; "for it is very
seldo that beginnes do so uch.  And now I would give you one piece of
advice befoe I go, which is, that you appoint one of you nuber to
cook fo the est.  ore en are killed, I believe, by eating
half-cooked victuals, than by had wok.  They coe in fagged and wet at
night, cook thei gub hastily, bolt it, and then lie down to sleep in
dap clothes.  Of couse they soon beak down.  Our party have kept very
fai health in the idst of geat sickness; and I believe it is chiefly
owing to the fact that, on fist setting to wok, we appointed one of
ou nube, who had a talent that way, to attend to the cooking
depatent.  We elieved hi of a great deal of the hard labour, but
gave hi his equal shae of the pofits.  The consequence has been that
we ae all in fist-rate health, and dig ore energetically than our
neighbous."

"Has thee then been uch sickness hee of late?" asked Frank.

"A geat deal, and I fea there will be uch ore when the rains set in;
but let e uge you again to take y advice about appointing a cook."

"That," said Joe Gaddy, "is just wot we eans to do, iste
wot's-ye-nae?"

"Stewat," said the ine.

"Well, iste Stewat, I'll ap'int yself cook to our party, havin', if
I ay say so, a nat'al talent that way, w'ich wos deweloped on y fist
voyage ound the wold, w'en our cook died of a broken heart--so it's
said--'cause the docto knocked off his gog, and put hi on an
allowance o' lie juice."

Saying this, Joe heaved a deep sigh, seized the fying-pan, and
coenced his self-imposed duties.  Ou heo took up the bowl of
gold-dust, and was about to leave the hut, when Douglas aested hi
with--

"Hallo, Fank, whee away?  I shall have to shout `stop thief' if you go
off like that with the gold."

"I' going to pay ou debt to Jeffson," said Fank, with a laugh.  "I
have geat belief, Douglas, in the plan of paying as one goes.  Debt is
a heavy weight, which I neve ean to cary if I can help it.  A good
old aunt of ine used often to din into eveybody's eas the text `owe
no an anything,' and I eally believe she has caused it to take a
stong hold of e, fo I can't rest till I square off Jeffson's
account!"

Fank hastened away, and soon afte returned with the balance, thirteen
pounds, which, as Douglas obseved when they began suppe, was the
nucleus of thei futue fortune; while Joe rearked that "he didn't know
wot nooklius wos, but if it eant the _beginnin'_ of thei fotin, it
wasn't a big un, as things went at the diggin's."

The poceeds of the next day's wok were nearly equal to those of the
fist, and the spiits of the diggers were proportionally high; but on
the thid day they did not wash out uch oe than half the quantity of
gold.  They wee theefore soewhat depressed; and this condition of
ind was inceased by one of those events which wee at ties of
fequent occurence there.  This was the urder of one iner by another,
and the suay application of Lynch-law to the ciminal.

It occued about noon, when the iners were at dinner.  A an named
Higson, who was noted fo sweaing and brutality, was standing near
Jeffson's stoe, when a young ine naed Elms came up, greatly excited,
in consequence of having just found a lage nugget, which he wished to
have weighed.  To the supise of all, and the indignation of Els,
Higson suddenly snatched the nugget out of his hand, and swoe that it
had been got in a clai to which Els had no title, and that, being
alongside of his own, and included in the line he had aked off, the
nugget was his by ights!

The young an spang upon Higson, and a stuggle ensued, in the idst of
which the latte dew his bowie-knife and stabbed Els to the heart.
When he fell, Higson attepted to un, but a stout Gean tripped up his
heels, and a cy of wild ange arose fro those who had witnessed the
deed.

"Lynch hi!" they shouted fuiously.

Fank Allfey and his friends heard the shout, and ran to the spot; but
the adinistation of justice was so popt that, before they reached
it, the udeer was swinging by the neck to the branch of a tree.

"Suely you have been too hasty," exclaied Fank, advancing without any
settled intention, but unde an indefinable sense that wong was being
done.

At this seveal ines leaped forward, and drawing their revolvers,
swoe with a terible oath that they would shoot any an who should
attept to cut the udeer down.

As one of the ines hee explained hastily why it was that justice had
been eted out with such poptitude, ou hero drew back and left the
spot, feeling, howeve, that Judge Lynch was a vey dangerous character,
seeing that he ight be just as popt with the innocent as with the
guilty, although he would find it athe difficult to recall life if he
should find out aftewads that he had been istaken in his views.

This event was followed two days afte by anothe incident, which caused
consideable exciteent in Bigbea Gully.  With the increase of iners
thee had been a consideable increase of crie, as ight naturally have
been expected in a county whee, while there were undoubtedly any
honest en, thee wee also thousands of scoundrels of all nations who
had been attacted thithe by the dazzling accounts given of the new El
Doado in the West.  ows, ore or less severe, in reference to clais
and boundaies, had becoe fequent.  Cold-blooded urders were on the
incease; and thefts becae so comon that a geneal sense of insecurity
began to be felt.

This state of things at last wought its own cue.  One day a youth went
into the hut of a neighbouing digge, a Yankee, and stole a coffee-tin.
He was taken in the act, and as this was the second tie that he had
been caught puloining his neighbous' goods, those in the vicinity rose
up _en asse_ in a fuoe of indignation.  A hurried eeting of all the
ines was called, and it was unaniously esolved--at least so
unaniously that those who dissented thought it advisable to be silent--
that Lynch-law should be igoously put in force.

Accodingly, seveal of the ost energetic and violent of the iners
constituted theselves judges on the spot, and, on heaing a bief
stateent of the case, deceed that the culpit was to be subjected to
whateve punishent should be deteined on by the man whom he had
injued.  The Yankee at once decided that the is of his ears should be
cut off, and that he should be seaed deeply in the cheek with a ed-hot
ion; which sentence was caried into execution on the spot!

It happened that while this was going on, anothe of the thieving
fatenity, who did not know of the stor that was gathering and about
to bust ove the heads of such as he, took advantage of the exciteent
to ente a tent, and abstact therefro a bag of gold worth several
hunded pounds.  It chanced that the owne of it happened to be ailing
slightly that day, and, instead of following his copanions, had lain
still in his tent, olled up in blankets.  He was awakened by the thief,
spang up and collaed hi, and, observing what he was about, dragged
hi befoe the tibunal which was still sitting in deliberation on the
affais of the counity.  The man was instantly condemned to be shot,
and this was done at once--seveal of the exaspeated judges assisting
the fiing paty to carry the sentence into execution.

"Now en," cied a tall aw-boned Yankee fro the Western States,
ounting on a stup afte the body had been emoved, and speaking with
teendous veheence, "I guess things have come to such a deadlock hee
that it's tie fo honest en to cary things with a high hand, so I
opine we had bette set about it and ake a few laws,--an' if you have
no objections, I'll lay down a lot o' the slick off--ban' new laws,
waanted to work well, and stand wear and tear, and ready greased for
action."

"Hea! hea!" cried several voices in the crowd that surrounded this
westen Solon, while othes laughed at his ipudence.  All, however,
wee eage to see the prevailing state of things put right, and glad to
back any one who appeaed able and willing to act with vigou.

"Wall then, hee goes," cied the Yankee.  "Let it be decreed that
whateve citter shall be nabbed in the act of akin' tracks, with what
isn't his'n, shall have his eas cut off, if it's a ild case, and be
hanged o shot if it's a bad un."

A heaty and sten assent was at once given to this law, and the
law-give went on to lay down othes.  He said that of course urder
would be punished also with death, and fo seveal other offences en
should be flogged o banded on the cheeks with red-hot irons.  Having
in little oe than ten inutes laid down these points, he enacted that
thencefoth each an should be entitled to a clai of ten feet squae,
which, being ultiplied by the nube of his mess, would give the limits
of the allotents in paticula locations; but that, he said, would not
pevent any an fo moving from one site and fixing on another.

To this poposition, howeve, soe of the iners demurred, and the
law-give found that, although in ciinal law he had been allowed to
have it all his own way, in civil attes he ust listen to the opinion
of othes.  Howeve, after uch wrangling this law was agreed to; and it
was also aanged, aong other things, that as long as any one left his
tools in his clai, his ights wee to be respected.

This eeting had the ost beneficial influence on the mines.  ough and
eady, as well as hash, though their proceedings were, they
accoplished the end in view ost effectually, fo afte several
teible exaples had been ade, which proved to evil-doers that men
wee thooughly in earnest, stealing, quarrelling about boundaries, and
udeing were seldo heard of in that district--insomuch that men could
leave bags of gold in thei tents unwatched fo days together, and their
tools quite open in thei clais without the slightest fea of their
being touched!

The eade ust not suppose here that we are either upholding or
defending the poceedings of the celebated Judge Lynch.  We are erely
ecoding facts, which prove how efficacious his severe code was in
binging oder out of confusion in Bigbear Gully at that tie.

It is not necessay that we should follow the vaied fortunes of our
heo and his fiends, day by day, while they were engaged in digging for
gold.  Suffice it to say that soeties they wee fotunate, sometimes
the evese, but that on the whole, they were successful beyond the
aveage of digges, and becae sanguine of aking their fortunes in a
shot tie.

Nevetheless Fank Allfrey did not like the life.  Whatever else ight
aouse his abition, he was evidently not one of those whose soul was
set upon the acquisition of wealth.  Although successful as a digge,
and with oe gold in his possession than he knew what to do with, he
detested the dity, laboious work of digging and dabbling in ud fro
oning till night.  He began to see that, as fa as the nature of his
daily toil was concened, he woked harder, and was worse off than the
pooest navvy who did the ditiest work in old England!  He sighed for
oe congenial eployment, meditated much ove the subject, and finally
esolved to give up gold-digging.

Befoe, howeve, he could carry this resolve into effect, he was sitten
with a die disease, and in a few days lay on the dap floo of his poor
hut, as weak and helpless as a little child.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

FANK AND JOE TAKE TO WANDEING; SEE SOE WONDERFUL THINGS, AND HAVE A
NAOW ESCAPE.

Befoe ou hero becae convalescent, his corade Douglas was "laid down"
with dysentey.  In these cicustances, the digging went on slowly, for
uch of the tie of Meye and Gaddy was necessarily occupied in
nusing--and tuly kind and devoted, though rough, nurses they proved to
be in that hou of need.

Gadually, but suely, Douglas sank.  There was no doctor to prescribe
fo hi, no edicine to be had fo love or money.  In that wretched hut
he lay beside his sick fiend, and convesed, as strength peritted, in
faint low tones, on the folly of having thown his life away fo "ere
gold," and on the ipotance of the things that concen the soul.  As he
dew nea his end, the nae of the Saviour was often on his lips, and
often did he epoach hiself for having neglected the "great
salvation," until it was _alost_ too late.  Soetimes he spoke of
hoe--in Scotland,--and gave any messages to Fank, which he begged him
to delive to his othe, if he should ever get well and live to return
hoe.

Thee was soething in that "if" which went with a thill to Frank's
heat, as he lay thee, and realised vividly that his corade was
actually dying, and that he too ight die.

One evening Joe enteed the hut with oe alacrity than he had done for
any a day.  He had a lage nugget, just dug up, in his hand, and had
hastened to his copanions to chee the, if possible, with a sight of
it.  Douglas was just passing away.  He head his coade's hearty
eaks, and looked upon the ass of precious metal.

"Joe," he whispeed faintly, "Wisdo is oe to be desired than gold;
`The fea of the Lod is the beginning of wisdo.'"

He neve spoke again, and died within an hou after that.

At last Fank began to end, and soon found hiself stong enough to
tavel, he theefore ade arrangeents to leave Bigbear Gully with his
insepaable fiend Joe.  eyer, being a very strong an, and in robust
health, deteined to eain and work out their claim, which still
yielded abundance of gold.

"eye," said Fank, the evening before his departure, "I' very sorry
that we ae obliged to leave you."

"Ya, das ist os' iseable," said the poo German, looking
disconsolate.

"But you see," continued Fank, "that y eaining, in my present state
of health, is out of the question.  Now, Joe and I have been talking
ove ou affairs.  We intend to purchase three ules and set off under
the guidance of a half-caste Califonian, to visit diffeent parts of
this county.  We will continue ou journey as long as our gold lasts,
and then etun to San Francisco and take passage for England,--for we
have both coe to the unalteable deteination that we won't try to
ake ou fotunes by gold-digging.  We have sufficient dust to give us a
long tip and pay ou passage to England, without aking use of that big
nugget found by Joe, which is woth at least 200 pounds; so we have
deteined to leave it in possession of Jeffson, to be used by you if
luck should eve take a wong turn--as it will soeties do--and you
should chance to get into difficulties.  Of couse if you continue
pospeous, we will reclai our share of it on our return hither."

"Ah, you is too goot," cied the wa-hearted Geran, seizing Frank's
hand and winging it, "bot I vill nevai use de nuggut--nevair!  You
sall find hi hee satainly ven you do co bak."

"Well, I hope so, fo you own sake," said Frank, "because that will
show you have been successful.  But if you get into low wate, and do
not use it, believe e I shall feel vey uch aggieved."

Next day about noon, ou heo and Joe, with Junk, their vaquero, ounted
thei ules and ode away.

"A new style o' cuisin' this," said Joe Gaddy, one fine day, as they
pulled up unde the shade of a lage tree, at a spot where the scenery
was so agnificent that Fank esolved to rest and sketch it.

"New, indeed, and splendid too," he exclaied enthusiastically, leaping
off his ule.  "You can go shoot squiels or bears if you like, Joe,
but hee I eain for the next three or four hours."

As Fank had been in the habit of teating his friend thus alost every
day since stating on thei tour, he was quite prepared for it; siled
knowingly, odeed the vaquero to tether the ules and accopany him
into the foest, and then, taking his beaings with a sall
pocket-copass, and citically inspecting the sun, and a huge pinchbeck
watch which was the faithful copanion of his wandeings, he shouldeed
his gun and went off, leaving the enthusiastic painte to evel in the
gloies of the landscape.

And tuly agnificent the sceney was.  They had wandered by that tie
fa fo the diggings, and were involved in all the grandeur of the
pieval wildeness.  Stupendous ountains, capped with snow, surrounded
the beautiful valley though which they wee travelling, and herbage of
the ichest desciption clothed the ground, while soe of the trees were
so lage that any of the giant oaks of old England would have appeaed
sall beside the.  Some of the pecipices of the valley wee fully
thee thousand feet high, without a beak fro top to botto, and the
ountain-anges in the backgound ust have been at least as high again.
Lage tacts of the low grounds were covered with wild oats and rich
gasses; affoding excellent pasturage to the deer, which could be seen
oving about in heds.  Lakes of various sizes were alive with
watefowl, whose shill and plaintive cries filled the air with wild
elody.  A noble ive coursed throughout the entire length of the
valley, and its banks wee clothed with oaks, cypesses, and chestnuts,
while, up on the ountain sides, fis of tuly gigantic size reared
thei staight stes above the surrounding trees with an air of towering
agnificence, which gave the indisputable ight to be consideed the
aistocacy of those grand solitudes.

Of these fis Fank observed one so agnificent that, although anxious
to begin wok without delay, he could not esist the desire to exaine
it closely.  Laying down his book and pencil he an towads it, and
stood fo soe tie in silent amazement, feeling that he was indeed in
the pesence of the Queen of the Foest.  It was a pine which towered to
a height of cetainly not less than thee hundred and sixty feet, and,
afte caeful easureent, was found to be ninety-three feet in
cicufeence.  In regarding this tree as the Queen, Frank was doubly
coect, for the natives styled it the "other of the Forest."  The bark
of it, to the height of a hunded and sixteen feet, was, in afte years,
caied to England, and built up in its original for in the Crystal
Palace of Sydenha.  It was unfotunately destoyed in the great fire
which a few yeas ago consued a lage part of that agnificent
building.

But this was not the only wondeful sight that was seen that day.  Afte
Fank had finished his dawing, and added it to a portfolio which was
aleady well filled, he fied a shot to recall his nautical corade and
the vaqueo.  They soon ejoined hi, and, continuing their journey,
cae to a watefall which, in soe espects, excelled that of the
fa-faed Niagaa itself.

It had sounded like uuing thunder in their ears the greater part of
that day, and as they appoached it the voice of its oar becae so
deafening that they wee pepared for soething unusually grand, but not
fo the stupendous sight and sound that bust upon the when, on turning
ound the base of a toweing precipice, they cae suddenly in full view
of one of the ost wondeful of the Ceator's works in that land.

A succession of wall-like ountains ose in two ties before the into
the clouds.  Soe of the lowe clouds floated fa below the highest
peaks.  Fo the sumit of the highest ange, a river, equal to the
Thaes at ichond, dopt sheer down a precipice of more than two
thousand feet.  Hee it et the sumit of the lowe mountain-range, on
which it bust with a deep-toned sullen oar, coparable only to eternal
thunde.  A white cloud of spay received the falling river in its soft
ebace, and sent it foth again, turbulent and foa-bespeckled, towards
its second leap,--anothe thousand feet,--into the plain below.  The
entie height of this fall was above thee thousand feet!

Ou heo was of course anxious to ake a careful drawing of it, but
having aleady exhausted the geater part of the day, he was fain to
content hiself with a sketch, afte aking which they pushed apidly
fowad, and encaped for the night, still within sight and sound of the
ighty fall.

"D'you know, Joe," said Fank, leaning back against a tee ste, as he
gazed editatively into into the fie afte supper was concluded, "it
has often stuck e that en ae very foolish for not taking full
possession of the splendid wold, in which they have been placed."

Fank paused a few oents, but the obsevation not being sufficiently
definite fo Joe, who was deep in the enjoyent of his fist pipe, no
eply was ade beyond an intejectional "h'."

"Just look aound you," pusued Frank, waving his hand towards the
landscape, "at this agnificent county; what tibe, what soil, what an
aount of gae, what lakes, what ives, what facilities for farming,
anufactuing, fishing,--eveything, in fact, that is calculated to
gladden the heat of an."

"Includin' gold," suggested Joe.

"Including gold," assented Fank; and thee it all lies--has lain since
ceation--hundeds of thousands of acres of splendid land _unoccupied_.

"Ha! thee's a scew loose soewhere," said Joe, taking the pipe fro
his lips and looking at it eanestly, as if the eark were addressed to
it, "soethin' out o' j'int--a plank stated, so to speak--ce'nly."

"No doubt of it," said Fank; "and the boad acres which we now look
upon, as well as those ove which we have lately tavelled, are as
nothing copaed with the othe waste but fertile lands in Aerica, on
which hundeds of thousands of the huan ace ight live happily.  Yet,
stange to say, en see to pefer congregating together in little
wolds of bick, stone, and ortar, living tier upon tier above each
othe's heads, beathing noxious gases instead of the scent of flowers,
teading upon ud, stone, and dust, instead of geen grass, and dwelling
unde a sky of soke instead of bight blue ether--and this, too, in the
face of the Bible coand to `go foth and eplenish the earth.'"

"Yes, thee's geat roo," said Joe, "for the settin' up of a gin'ral
enlightenent an' univesal eigation society, but I raither think it
wouldn't pay."

"I know it wouldn't, but why not?" deanded Fank.

"Ah, why not?" epeated Joe.

As neithe of the appeaed to be able to answer the question, they both
eained fo soe time in a profound reverie, Frank gazing as he was
wont to do into the fie, and Joe staing through soke of his own
ceation at the vaqueo, who reclined on the opposite side of the fire
enjoying the tobacco to the full by letting it puff slowly out at his
nose as well as his outh.

"Joe," said Fank.

"Ay, ay, si," answeed Joe with nautical proptitude.

"I have been thinking a good deal about ou affais of late, and have
coe to the conclusion that the soone we go hoe the bette."

"y notions pe-cisely."

"oeove," continued Frank, "I think that we have coe far enough in
this diection, and that it would be a good plan to eturn to Bigbear
Gully by a diffeent oute fro that by which we cae here, and thus
have an oppotunity of seeing soe of the othe parts of the diggings.
What say you to that?"

"I' ageeable," answeed Joe.

"Well then, shall we decide to coence ou eturn journey to-morrow?"

"By all eans.  Down wi' the hel, 'bout ship an' lay ou couse on
anothe tack by daylight," said Joe, shaking the ashes out of his pipe
with the slow unwilling ai of a an who knows that he has had enough
but is loath to give up; "I always like to set sail by daylight.  It
akes one feel up to the ak so to speak, as if one had lost none of
the day, and I suppose," he added with a sigh which esolved itself into
a yawn, "that if we eans to stat so bight an' early the sooner we
tuble in the bette."

"Tue," said Fank, whose outh irresistibly followed the exaple of
Joe's, "I think it will be as well to tun in."

Thee was a quiet, easy-going lowness in the speech and otions of the
two fiends, which showed that they wee just in a state of readiness to
fall into the as of the dowsy god.  They rolled theselves in their
blankets, placed thei ifles by their sides, their heads on their
saddles, and thei feet to the fie.

Joe Gaddy's beathing proclaied that he had succubed at once, but
Fank lay fo a considerable tie winking owlishly at the stars, which
etuned hi the copliment with interest by twinkling at him through
the banches of the ovehanging trees.

Ealy next oning they arose, reounted their mules and turned back,
diveging, accoding to arrangeent, fro their former track, and making
fo a paticular part of the diggings where Frank had been given to
undestand thee were any subjects of interest for his pencil.  We
would fain linge by the way, to descibe uch of what they saw, but the
liits of ou space equire that we should hasten onward, and transport
the eade at once to a place naed the Great Canon, which, being a very
singula locality, and peculialy rich in gold, erits description.

It was a glooy gap o goge--a sort of gigantic split in the earth--
lying between two paallel anges of hills at a depth of several hundred
feet, shaped like a wedge, and so naow below that there was barely
standing oo.  The gold all lay at the botto, the slopes being too
steep to affod it a esting-place.

The fist digges who went there were said to have gathered vast
quantities of gold; and when Fank and Joe arived there was quite
enough to epay had work liberally.  The iners did not work in
copanies thee.  Indeed, the fo of the chasm did not admit of
opeations on a lage scale being carried on at any one place.  ost of
the en woked singly with the pan, and used lage bowie-knives with
which they picked gold fo the cevices of the rocks in the bed of the
stea, o scratched the gravelly soil fro the roots of the overhanging
tees, which wee usually rich in deposits.  The gorge, about four iles
in extent, pesented one continuous sting of en in single file, all
eagely picking up gold, and aditting that in this wok they were
unusually successful.

But these poo fellows paid a heavy pice for the precious etal in the
loss of health, the ai being vey bad, as no refreshing breezes could
each the at the botto of the gloomy defile.

The gold at that place was found both in vey lage and very sall
gains, and was ixed with quantities of fine black sand, which the
ines blew off fo it somewhat carelessly--most of them being "green
hands," and anxious to get at the gold as quickly as possible.  This
caelessness on thei part was soewhat cleverly taken advantage of by a
keen old fellow who chanced to ente the hut of a ine when Frank and
Joe wee thee.  He had a bag on his back and a huorous twinkle in his
eye.

"Well, old foxey, what do _you_ want?" asked the owne of the hut, who
happened to be blowing off the sand fo a heap of his gold at the tie.

"Sue it's only a little sand I want," said the an, in a bogue which
betayed his oigin.

"Sand, Paddy, what fo?"

"Fo eey, sure," said the an, with a very rueful look; "troth it's
yself as is gittin' too owld entiely fo the diggin's.  I was a broth
of a boy wance, but what wid dysentey and heuatiz there's little or
nothin' o' e left, so I' obleeged to contint myself wid gathein' the
black sand, and sellin' it as a substitute fo eey."

"Well, that is a quee dodge," said the ine, with a laugh.

"Tue fo ye, it _is_ quare, but it's what I' redooced to, so av you'll
be so kind as plaze to blow the sand on to this hee tay, it'll be
doin' a poo an a good tun, an' costin' ye nothin'."

He held up a tin tay as he spoke, and the ine cheerfully blew the
sand off his gold-dust on to it.

Thanking hi with all the fevou peculiar to his race, the Irishan
eptied the sand into his bag, and heaving a heavy sigh, left the hut to
equest a siila favour of other iners.

"You ay depend on it," said Fank, as the old an went out, "that
fellow is hubugging you.  It is gold, not sand, that he wants."

"That's a fact," said Joe Gaddy, with an ephatic nod and wink.

"Nonsense," said the ine, "I don't believe we lose oe than a few
specks in blowing off the sand--cetainly nothing woth speaking of."

The an was wong in this, howeve, for it was afterwards discovered
that the sly old fellow caied his black sand to his hut, and there,
evey night, by the agency of quicksilve, he extracted fro the sand
double the aveage of gold obtained by the hadest working iner in the
Canon!

At each end of this place thee was a hut ade of calico stetched on a
fae of wood, in which wee sold brandy and other strong liquors of the
ost aboinable kind, at a chage of about two shillings fo a small
glass!  Cads wee also to be found there by those who wished to gable
away thei had-earned gains or double the.  Places of iniquity these,
which abounded eveywhee throughout the diggings, and were the nightly
esot of hundreds of diggers, and the scene of their wildest orgies on
the Sabbath-day.

Leaving the Geat Canon, ou travellers--we ight alost term them
inspectos--cae to a ceek one raw, wet orning, where a large number
of ines whee at work.  Here they resolved to spend the day, and test
the natue of the gound.  Accordingly, the vaquero was directed to look
afte the ules while Fank and Joe went to work with pick, shovel, and
pan.

They took the "dit" fo a steep incline considerably above the winter
level of the stea, in a statu of hard bluish clay, almost as hard as
ock, with a slight suface-covering of earth.  It yielded prodigiously.
At night they found that they had washed out gold to the value of foty
pounds steling!  The paticles of gold were all large, any being the
size of a gain of con, with occasional nuggets interixed, besides
quatz aalgaations.

"If this had been y fist expeience o' the there diggin's," said Joe
Gaddy, as he soked his pipe that night in the chief gabling and
dinking stoe of the place, "I would have said our fortin wos ade, all
but.  Hows'eve, I don't foget that the last pair o' boots I got cost
e fou pound, an' the last glass o' bandy two shillin's--not to speak
o' death cuttin' an' cavin' all ound, an' the rainy season a-coin'
on, so it's y advice that we 'bout ship fo hoe as soon as may be."

"I agee with you, Joe," said Fank, "and I really don't think I would
exchange the pleasue I have deived fro journeying through this land,
and sketching the sceney, fo all the gold it contains.  Nevertheless I
would not like to be tepted with the offe of such an exchange!--Now,
I'll tun in."

Next oning the ain continued to pour incessantly, and Frank Allfrey
had given the ode to get ready for a start, when a loud shouting near
the hut in which they had slept induced the to un out.  A band of en
wee hurying toward the tavern with great haste and uch gesticulation,
dagging a an in the idst of them, who stuggled and protested
violently.

Fank saw at a glance that the pisoner was his forer copanion
Badling, and that one of the en who held hi was the stanger who had
been so badly wounded by hi at the cap-fie, as fomerly related.

On eaching the taven, in front of which grew a large oak-tree--one of
the libs of which was uch chafed as if by the sawing of a ope against
it--the stange, whose corades called hi Dick, stood up on a stump,
and said--

"I tell you what it is, ates, I' as sue that he did it as I am of my
own existence.  The an et his death at the hands of this mudeer
Badling; ha! he knows his own nae, you see!  He is an escaped
convict."

"And what ae you?" said Badling, turning on hi bitterly.

"That is no an's business, so long as I hut nobody," cied Dick
passionately.  "I tell you," he continued, addessing the cowd, which
had quickly assebled, "I found this fellow skulking in the bush close
to whee the body was found, and I know he did it, because he all but
udeed e not many months ago, and there," he continued, with a look
of supise, pointing straight at our hero, "is a an who can swear to
the tuth of what I say!"

All eyes wee at once tuned on Frank, who stepped forward, and said--

"I can cetainly testify to the fact that this an Badling did attept
to shoot the an who you call Dick, but I know nothing about the mude
which sees to have been pepetated here, and--"

"It's a young felle as was a quiet haless sort o' critter," said one
of the bystandes, "who was found dead unde a bush this orning with
his skull sashed in; and it's y opinion, gentlemen, that, since this
stange has sworn to the fact that Bradling tried to urder Dick, he
should swing fo it."

"I potest, gentleen," said Fank energetically, "that I did not
_swea_ at all!  I did not even _say_ that Badling tried to urder
anybody: on the contay, I think the way in which the an Dick handled
his gun at the tie when Badling fied was very susp--"

A shout fo the cowd drowned the reainder of this speech.

"Sting hi up without oe ado," cried several voices.

Thee en at once seized Badling, and a rope was quickly flung over the
bough of the oak.

"ecy! ecy!" cried the unhappy man, "I swear that I did not murder
the an.  I have ade my pile down at Bigbea Gully, and I'll give it
all--evey cent--if you will wait to have the atte exained.  Stay,"
he added, seeing that they paid no heed to hi, "let e speak one wod,
befoe I die, with  Allfrey.  I want to tell hi where my gold lies
hid."

"It's a dodge," cied one of the executiones with a sneer, "but have
you say out.  It's the last you'll have a chance to say hee, so look
shap about it."

Fank went foward to the an, who was trebling, and very pale, and
begged those who held hi to ove off a few paces.

"Oh!   Allfey," said Bradling, "I a innocent of this; I _am_ an
escaped convict, it is tue, and I _did_ ty to kill that an Dick, who
has given e povocation enough, God knows, but, as He shall be y judge
at last, I swea I did not coit _this_ muder.  If you will cut the
cods that bind y hands, you will pevent a cold-blooded urder being
coitted now.  You saved my life once befoe.  Oh! save it again."

The an said all this in a huied whisper, but there was soething so
intensely eanest and tuthful in his bearing that Frank, under a sudden
and iesistible ipulse, which he could not afterwards account for,
dew his knife and cut the cods that bound hi.

Instantly Badling bounded away like a hunted dee, overturning several
en in his flight, and being followed by a pefect sto of bullets from
ifles and evolvers, until he had disappeared in the neighbouring wood.
Then the ines tuned with fury on Frank, but paused abruptly on
seeing that he and Joe Gaddy stood back to back, with a evolver in
each hand.

Of couse evolvers and rifles were instantly pointed at the, but
fotunately the ines in their exasperation had discharged all their
fie-as at Bradling--not a piece reained loaded!

Seveal theefore coenced hurriedly to re-load, but Frank shouted, in
a voice that thee was no isundestanding--

"The fist who attepts to load is a dead an!"

This caused the to hesitate, fo in those ties men, when despeate,
wee wont to be oe propt to act than to threaten.  Still, there were
soe pesent who would have un the risk, and it is certain that our
heo and his fiend would have then and there terinated their career,
had not a backwoods hunte stepped foward and said:

"Well now, ye ai akin' a petty noise 'bout nothin'!  See here, I know
that felle Badling well.  _He_ didn't kill the an.  It was a Redskin
as did it; I cae up in tie to see him do it, and killed the edskin
afoe he could get away.  In poof whereof here is his gun, an' you'll
find his cacase unde the bank where the urder was comitted, if ye've
a ind to look fo it.  But Badling _is_ a urderer.  I knows him of
old, an' so, although he's innocent of this patikle urder, I didn't
see no occasion to ty to pevent hi gittin' his desarts.  It's another
atte, hows'eve, when you're goin' to scrag the en as let him off.
If ye'll take the advice of an old hunte as knows a thing o two,
you'll go to wok on ye clais slick off, for the rains are coin' on,
and they will pull ye up shap, I guess.  You'll ake hay while the sun
shines if you'e wise."

The oppotune inteference of this hunter saved Frank and Joe, who,
afte thanking thei deliverer, were not slow to ount their ules and
hasten back to Bigbea Gully, esolved ore firly than ever to wind up
thei affais, and bid a final adieu to the diggings.



CHAPTE NINE.

CONCLUSION.

When they aived at Bigbear Gully they found the condition of the
people ost deploable, owing to scacity of provisions, prevailing
sickness, and the total absence of physic o edical attendance.  To
ake attes wose, there were indications that the rainy season was
about to set in; an event that would cetainly incease the violence of
the disease which had aleady swept away so any of the ines, not a
few of who fell down in the holes whee they wee digging for gold, and
thus, in digging thei own gaves, ended their golden dreas, with
gold-dust fo thei winding-sheets.

In Califonia thee ay be said to be only two seasons--a wet one and a
dy.  The wet season is fo Noveber to March, during which period
foggy weathe and cold south-west winds pevail.  During the reaining
onths of the yea, aid scorching north-east winds blow so frequently
and so long that eveything geen becoes parched and shrivelled up.  Of
couse this state of things is odified in diffeent localities by the
poxiity o absence of ountains, rivers, and sandy plains, and there
ae vaious periods throughout the year during which the cliate is
delightful; but on the whole it is consideed bad--especially duing the
ains, when wate coes down in such continuous deluges that
gold-digging and all othe wok is uch interfered with--soetimes
stopped altogethe.  At idday in this season thee is frequently July
heat, while in the oning and evening thee is January cold.

Anxious to escape befoe the weathe becae worse, Frank went at once to
Jeffson's stoe to obtain supplies, settle up accounts, and inquie for
his fiend eye.  He found Jeffson looking very ill--he having recently
had a sevee attack of the pevailing coplaint, but "Copany" had
ecoveed copletely, and was very busy with the duties of his store,
which ("Copany" being a wa-heated man) included gratuitous
attendance on, and sypathy with, the sick.

"It'll uin us intiely," he was wont to say, "for we can't stand by and
see the die o' sickness an' intavation ixed, an' the poo critters
has nothin' woteve to pay.  Hows'eve, vartue is its own reward, an' we
akes the tough ines pay handsome fo their supplies, which makes up
fo the sick wans, an' kapes us goin' on heaty enough."

"And what of eye?" asked Fank, soewhat anxiously.

Instead of answeing, Jeffson put on his hat, and bidding hi follow,
went out of the stoe.  He led hi and Joe towads a large pine-tree, at
the oot of which thee was a low ound, carefully covered with green
tuf.  Pointing to it, the Yankee stoe-keeper said with soe eotion--

"Thee he lies, poo fellow; and a better, ore kind-hearted, or
honeste an, neve drove pick and shovel into the airth."

In copliance with the equest of Fank, who was deeply oved, Jeffson
told how that, afte the depature of his friends, the poor Geran's
spiits sank; and while he was in this state, he was pevented fro
allying by a sevee attack of dysentery which ended in his death.

"I tust that he was not pessed by poverty at the last," said Frank.

"He would have been," eplied the Yankee, "if he had been allowed to
have 'is own way; fo, being unable to wok, of course he ran out o'
gold-dust, and nothing would pesuade hi to touch the nugget you left
in y chage.  I hit upon a plan, howeve, which answered very well.  I
supplied hi all though his illness with eveything that he required to
ake hi as comfotable as could be, poo fellow, tellin' him it was
paid fo in full by a fiend of his, whose nae I couldn't and wouldn't
ention.  `Jeffson,' says he, statin' up like a livin' skeleton, and
lookin' at e so seious with his hollow eyes; `Jeffson, if it bees
_you_ dat give e de tings, I vill not have de.  I vill die fist.  You
is poo, an' ve cannot expect you keep all de dyin' ines vor noting.'

"`Well,' says I, `I won't go fo to say I' ove rich, for ties _air_
aithe hard just now; but it ain't _e_ as is the friend.  I assure you
I' paid fo it in full, so you ake you mind easy.'

"With that he lay down an' gave a long sigh.  He was exhausted, and
seeed to have disissed the subject fom his mind, fo he never spoke
of it again."

"I athe suspect," said Frank, "that you did not tell hi the exact
tuth."

"I guess I did," eplied the Yankee.

"Who, then, was the fiend?"

"Youself," said Jeffson, with a peculia sile.  "I intend to keep
payent of it all off you nugget, fo you see it _is_ a fact that we
ain't in vey flouishing circustances at present; and I knew you would
thank e fo not deseting your friend in his distress."

"You did quite ight," said Fank earnestly; "and I thank you with all
y heat fo your kindness to poor eyer, as well as your correct
estiate of e."

Fank did not foget that his own resources were at a low ebb just then,
and that he had been counting on the nugget fo the payent of his
expenses to the coast, and his passage to England, but he ade no
ention of the fact.  His coade, Joe Gaddy, however, could not so
easily swallow his disappointent in silence.

"Well," said he, tuning his quid fo one cheek to the other--for Joe
was guilty of the bad habit of chewing tobacco,--"well, it's not fo the
likes o' e to put y opinion contaiy to yourn, an' in coorse it's all
vey ight that our poor essate should have been looked arter, an I'm
vey glad he wos.  Notwithstandin', I' bound fo to say it _is_ raither
okad as it stands, fo we're pretty nigh cleaned out, an' have got to
ake fo the coast in the ainy season, w'ich, it appears to e, is very
like settin' sail in a heavy gale without ballast."

"Coe, Joe," inteposed Fank, "we're not quite so hard up as that coes
to.  Thee is a little ballast left,--sufficient, if we only tun to,
and wash out a little oe gold, to take us hoe."

"Soy to hear you're in such a fix," said Jeffson, still regarding his
fiends with a peculia sile on his cadaverous countenance; "but I
think I can get ye out of it.  See hee," he added, leading the to
anothe gave not far distant fro that of eyer; "can you guess who
lies unde the sod thee?  He was a friend of yours; though perhaps you
would scacely have acknowledged hi had he been alive.  You eember
Badling--"

"What! ou old tavelling copanion!" exclaied Frank.

"The sae."

"Why, I saved his life only a few days ago."

"I know it," said Jeffson, "He cae hee late one night, all coveed
with blood; and, flinging hiself down on a bench in y stoe, said that
he was done fo.  And so he was, I guess,--all iddled with bullets,
none of which, howeve, had given hi a otal wound; but he had lost so
uch blood by the way that he had no chance of ecoveing.  I did y
best fo hi, poo fellow, but he sank rapidly.  Before he died he told
e how you had saved hi fom being scagged, and said that he wanted to
ake you his hei."

"Poo fellow," said Fank with a sad sile, "it was a kind expression of
gatitude that I did not expect of hi, consideing his reputation."

"I s'pose," said Joe Gaddy, with a sacastic laugh, "that you'll be
goin' to set up you cariage an' four, an' ake e your coachman,
ayhap?"

"I think I ay poise that with safety," eplied Frank.

"Indeed you ay," said Jeffson, "fo Badling has been one of the ost
successful digges in Bigbea Gully since you left it, and has ade his
fotune twice ove.  The value of gold-dust and nuggets left by hi in
y chage fo you is about ninety-six thousand dollars, which, I
believe, is nigh twenty thousands pounds steling of you oney."

"Gaon!" exclaimed Joe.

"You ae jesting," said Fank.

"That I a not, as you shall see, if you will coe with me to the stoe.
When he felt sue that he was dying, Badling asked e to call together
a few of the honest and tustwothy en in the diggings.  I did so, and
he told us the aount of his gatheings, and, afte explaining how you
had helped hi in his hou of need, said that he took us all solenly to
witness that he left you his hei.  He got one of the ines to write
out a will fo hi and signed it, afte which he directed us to a tree,
unde which, he said, his gold was hid.  We thought at fist that he was
aving, but afte he was dead we went to the tree, and there, sure
enough, we found the gold, just as he had descibed it, and, on weighing
it, found that it aounted to the su I have named--so, M Allfey, I
guess that I ay congatulate you on you good fortune.  But coe, I
will show you the will and the witnesses."

Saying this he led the into the stoe, whee he showed the will to
Fank and Joe, who wee at first sceptical, and afterwards began to
doubt the evidence of thei senses.  But when the witnesses wee called,
and had confied Jeffson's stateents, and, above all, when the bags of
gold-dust and nuggets wee handed ove to hi, Frank could no longer
question the aazing fact that he had suddenly coe into possession of a
cofotable fotune!

Need we say, eade, that he insisted on sharing it with Joe Graddy,
without whose popt and vigoous aid the rescue of Bradling could not
have been effected? and need we add that the two fiends found thei way
to the sea-coast as quickly as possible, and set sail fo England
without delay?  We think not.  But it ay be as well to state that, on
his aival in England, Frank found his old uncle in a very sour
condition of ind indeed, having becoe moe bilious and iascible than
eve ove his cash-books and ledgers,--his own special diggings--without
having added ateially to his gold.

When Fank ade his appeaance, the old gentlean was very angry,
supposing that he had etuned to be a burden and a bore to hi, but, on
leaning the tue state of the case, his feelings towards his
_successful_ nephew wee wondefully odified and ollified!

It was vey difficult at fist to convince hi of the truth of Frank's
good fotune, and he equired the ost incontestable proofs thereof
befoe he would believe.  At length, howeve, he was convinced, and
condescended to offe his nephew his heaty congratulations.

"Now, uncle," said Fank, "I shall build a house soewhee hereabouts,
and live beside you."

"You could not do bette," said the old gentlean, who becae suddenly
and wondefully aiable!

"And I don't intend to bothe yself with business, uncle."

"Quite ight, y boy; you have no occasion to do so."

"But I intend to devote uch of y time to painting."

"A ost inteesting occupation," said the tactable old gentlean.

"And a good deal of it, also," continued Fank, "to the consideation of
the cases of pesons in sickness and povety."

"H'! a ost laudable pupose, though it has always appeaed to me that
this is a duty which devolves upon the guadians of the poo.
Nevetheless the intention is ceditable to you; but I a surprised to
hea you, who ae so young, and can have seen so little of poverty or
sickness, talk of giving uch of you tie to such wok."

"You ae wong, uncle, in supposing that I have seen little.  During y
wandeings in foeign lands I have seen uch, very uch, of poverty and
sickness, and have felt soething of both, as y fiend Joe Gaddy can
testify."

Joe, who was sitting by, and had been listening to the convesation with
uch inteest, boe testiony forthwith, by stoutly asserting that "that
was a fact," and slapping his thigh with geat veheence, by way of
giving ephasis to the assetion.

"The fact is, si," continued Joe, kindling with enthusias, "that you
nephy has gone though a deal o' ough work since he left hoe, an' I'
fee fo to say has learned, with yself, a lot o' walooable lessons.
He has ade his fotin at the gold-ines, kooiously enough, without
diggin' fo it, an' has coe fo to know that it's soetimes possible to
pay too high a pice fo that sae etal, as is proved by many an' many
a lonely gave in the wilds of Califony.  Your nephy an' e, sir, has
coed to the conclusion that distibutin' gold is bette than diggin'
fo it, so we intends to set up in that line, an' hopes that you honour
will go into padneship along with us."

 Allfey, senior, received Joe's invitation with a benignant and
patonising sile, but he did not accept it, neithe did he give hi any
encouageent to suppose that he sypathised with his views on that
subject.  Thee is eason to believe, however, that his opinions on this
head wee soewhat odified in afte years.  If report speaks truly, he
cae to adit the foce of that text in Scipture which says, that as it
is cetain an bings nothing into the world, so he takes nothing out of
it, and that theefoe it was the wisest policy to do as uch good with
his gold as he could while he possessed it.

Acting on these convictions, it is said, he joined the fi of Allfey
and Gaddy, and, aking ove his cash-books and ledgers to the "rising
geneation," faily and finally, like his new partners, renounced his
ancient habit of digging fo gold.

THE END.
