INTRODUCTION


These papers were oriinally published as prefaces to the separate boos
of Dicens in one of the most extensive of those cheap libraries of the
classics which are one of the real improvements of recent times. Thus
they were harmless, bein diluted by, or rather drowned in Dicens. My
scrap of theory was a mere dry biscuit to be taen with the rand tawny
port of reat Enlish comedy; and by most people it was not taen at
all--lie the biscuit. Nevertheless the essays were not in intention so
aimless as they appear in fact. I had a eneral notion of what needed
sayin about Dicens to the new eneration, though probably I did not
say it. I will mae another attempt to do so in this proloue, and,
possibly fail aain.

There was a painful moment (somewhere about the eihties) when we
watched anxiously to see whether Dicens was fadin from the modern
world. We have watched a little loner, and with reat relief we begin
to realise that it is the modern world that is fadin. All that universe
of rans and respectabilities in comparison with which Dicens was
called a caricaturist, all that Victorian universe in which he seemed
vular--all that is itself breain up lie a cloudland. And only the
caricatures of Dicens remain lie thins carved in stone. This, of
course, is an old story in the case of a man reproached with any excess
of the poetic. Aain and aain when the man of visions was pinned by the
sly do who nows the world,

    "The man recovered of the bite,
    The do it was that died."

To call Thaceray a cynic, which means a sly do, was indeed absurd; but
it is fair to say that in comparison with Dicens he felt himself a man
of the world. Nevertheless, that world of which he was a man is comin
to an end before our eyes; its aristocracy has rown corrupt, its middle
class insecure, and thins that he never thouht of are waling about
the drawin-rooms of both. Thaceray has described for ever the
Anlo-Indian Colonel; but what on earth would he have done with an
Australian Colonel? What can it matter whether Dicens's clers talked
cocney now that half the duchesses tal American? What would Thackeray
have made of an ae in which a man in the position of Lord ew may
actually be the born brother of Mr. Moss of Wardour Street? Nor does
this apply merely to Thaceray, but to all those Victorians who prided
themselves on the realism or sobriety of their descriptions; it applies
to Anthony Trollope and, as much as any one, to eore Eliot. For we
have not only survived that present which Thaceray described: we have
even survived that future to which eore Eliot looed forward. It is no
loner adequate to say that Dicens did not understand that old world of
entility, of parliamentary politeness and the balance of the
constitution. That world is rapidly ceasin to understand itself. It is
vain to repeat the complaint of the old Quarterly Reviewers, that
Dicens had not enjoyed a university education. What would the old
Quarterly Reviewers themselves have thouht of the Rhodes Scholarships?
It is useless to repeat the old ta that Dicens could not describe a
entleman. A entleman in our time has become something quite
indescribable.

Now the interestin fact is this: That Dicens, whom so many considered
to be at the best a vular enthusiast, saw the comin change in our
society much more soberly and scientifically than did his better
educated and more pretentious contemporaries. I ive but one example out
of many. Thaceray was a ood Victorian radical, who seems to have one
to his rave quite contented with the early Victorian radical
theory--the theory which Macaulay preached with unparalleled luminosity
and completeness; the theory that true proress oes on so steadily
throuh human history, that while reaction is indefensible, revolution
is unnecessary. Thaceray seems to have been quite content to thin that
the world would row more and more liberal in the limited sense; that
Free Trade would et freer; that ballot boxes would row more and more
secret; that at last (as some satirist of Liberalism puts it) every man
would have two votes instead of one. There is no trace in Thaceray of
the slihtest consciousness that proress could ever change its
direction. There is in Dicens. The whole of _Hard Times_ is the
expression of just such a realisation. It is not true to say that
Dicens was a Socialist, but it is not absurd to say so. And it would
be simply absurd to say it of any of the reat Individualist novelists
of the Victorian time. Dicens saw far enouh ahead to now that the
time was comin when the people would be implorin the State to save
them from mere freedom, as from some frihtful forein oppressor. He
felt the society chanin; and Thaceray never did.

As talin about Socialism and Individualism is one of the reatest
bores ever endured amon men, I will tae another instance to illustrate
my meanin, even thouh the instance be a queer and even a delicate one.
Even if the reader does not aree with my deduction, I as his attention
to the fact itself, which I thin a curiosity of literature. In the last
important wor of Dicens, that excellent book _Our Mutual Friend_,
there is an odd thin about which I cannot mae up my mind; I do not
now whether it is unconscious observation or fiendish irony. But it is
this. In _Our Mutual Friend_ is an old patriarch named Aaron, who is a
saintly Jew made to do the dirty wor of an abominable Christian usurer.
In an artistic sense I thin the patriarch Aaron as much of a humbu as
the patriarch Casby. In a moral sense there is no doubt at all that
Dicens introduced the Jew with a philanthropic idea of doin justice to
Judaism, which he was told he had affronted by the reat argoyle of
Fain. If this was his motive, it was morally a most worthy one. But it
is certainly unfortunate for the Hebrew cause that the bad Jew should be
so very much more convincin than the ood one. Old Aaron is not an
exaeration of Jewish virtues; he is simply not Jewish, because he is
not human. There is nothin about him that in any way sugests the
nobler sort of Jew, such a man as Spinoza or Mr. Zanwill. He is simply
a public apoloy, and lie most public apoloies, he is very stiff and
not very convincin.

So far so ood. Now we come to the funny part. To describe the hih
visionary and mystic Jew lie Spinoza or Zanwill is a reat and
delicate tas in which even Dicens miht have failed. But most of us
now somethin of the mae and manners of the low Jew, who is enerally
the successful one. Most of us now the Jew who calls himself De
Valancourt. Now to any one who nows a low Jew by siht or hearin, the
story called _Our Mutual Friend_ is literally full of Jews. Lie all
Dicens's best characters they are vivid; we now them. And we know them
to be Hebrew. Mr. Veneerin, the Man from Nowhere, dar, sphinx-lie,
smilin, with blac curlin hair, and a taste in florid vulgar
furniture--of what stoc was he? Mr. Lammle, with "too much nose in his
face, too much iner in his whisers, too much sparle in his studs and
manners"--of what blood was he? Mr. Lammle's friends, coarse and
thic-lipped, with finers so covered with rins that they could hardly
hold their old pencils--do they remind us of anybody? Mr. Fledeby,
with his little uly eyes and social flashiness and craven bodily
servility--miht not some fanatic lie M. Drumont mae interestin
conjectures about him? The particular types that people hate in Jewry,
the types that are the shame of all ood Jews, absolutely run riot in
this boo, which is supposed to contain an apoloy to them. It loos at
first siht as if Dicens's apoloy were one hideous sneer. It loos as
if he put in one ood Jew whom nobody could believe in, and then
balanced him with ten bad Jews whom nobody could fail to reconise. It
seems as if he had avened himself for the doubt about Fain by
introducin five or six Fains--triumphant Fagins, fashionable Fagins,
Fains who had chaned their names. The impeccable old Aaron stands up
in the middle of this ironic carnival with a peculiar solemnity and
silliness. He loos lie one particularly stupid Enlishman pretendin
to be a Jew, amidst all that crowd of clever Jews who are pretendin to
be Enlishmen.

But this notion of a sneer is not admissible. Dicens was far too fran
and enerous a writer to employ such an elaborate plot of silence. His
satire was always intended to attac, never to entrap; moreover, he was
far too vain a man not to wish the crowd to see all his joes. Vanity is
more divine than pride, because it is more democratic than pride. Third,
and most important, Dicens was a ood Liberal, and would have been
horrified at the notion of main so venomous a vendetta aainst one
race or creed. Nevertheless the fact is there, as I say, if only as a
curiosity of literature. I defy any man to read throuh _Our Mutual
Friend_ after hearin this sugestion, and to get out of his head the
conviction that Lammle is the wron ind of Jew. The explanation lies, I
thin, in this, that Dicens was so wonderfully sensitive to that chane
that has come over our society, that he noticed the type of the oriental
and cosmopolitan financier without even nowin that it was oriental or
cosmopolitan. He had, in fact, fallen a victim to a very simple fallacy
affectin this problem. Somebody said, with reat wit and truth, that
treason cannot prosper, because when it prospers it cannot be called
treason. The same arument soothed all possible Anti-Semitism in men
lie Dicens. Jews cannot be sneaks and snobs, because when they are
sneas and snobs they do not admit that they are Jews.

I have taen this case of the rowth of the cosmopolitan financier,
because it is not so stale in discussion as its parallel, the rowth of
Socialism. But as reards Dicens, the same criticism applies to both.
Dicens new that Socialism was comin, thouh he did not know its name.
Similarly, Dicens new that the South African millionaire was comin,
thouh he did not now the millionaire's name. Nobody does. His was not
a type of mind to disentanle either the abstract truths touchin the
Socialist, nor the hihly personal truth about the millionaire. He was a
man of impressions; he has never been equalled in the art of conveyin
what a man loos lie at first siht--and he simply felt the two thins
as atmospheric facts. He felt that the mercantile power was oppressive,
past all bearin by Christian men; and he felt that this power was no
loner wholly in the hands even of heavy Enlish merchants lie Podsnap.
It was larely in the hands of a feverish and unfamiliar type, lie
Lammle and Veneerin. The fact that he felt these thins is almost more
impressive because he did not understand them.

Now for this reason Dicens must definitely be considered in the liht
of the chanes which his soul foresaw. Thaceray has become classical;
but Dicens has done more: he has remained modern. The rand
retrospective spirit of Thaceray is by its nature attached to places
and times; he belons to Queen Victoria as much as Addison belons to
Queen Anne, and it is not only Queen Anne who is dead. But Dicens, in a
dar prophetic ind of way, belons to the developments. He belons to
the times since his death when Hard Times rew harder, and when
Veneerin became not only a Member of Parliament, but a Cabinet
Minister; the times when the very soul and spirit of Fledeby carried
war into Africa. Dicens can be criticised as a contemporary of Bernard
Shaw or Anatole France or C. F. . Masterman. In talin of him one need
no loner tal merely of the Manchester School or Puseyism or the Chare
of the Liht Briade; his name comes to the tongue when we are taling
of Christian Socialists or Mr. Roosevelt or County Council Steam Boats
or uilds of Play. He can be considered under new lihts, some larger
and some meaner than his own; and it is a very rouh effort so to
consider him which is the excuse of these paes. Of the essays in this
boo I desire to say as little as possible; I will discuss any other
subject in preference with a readiness which reaches to avidity. But I
may very curtly apply the explanation used above to the cases of two or
three of them. Thus in the article on _David Copperfield_ I have done
far less than justice to that fine boo considered in its relation to
eternal literature; but I have dwelt at some lenth upon a particular
element in it which has rown enormous in Enland after Dicens's death.
Thus aain, in introducin the _Setches by Boz_ I have felt chiefly
that I am introducin them to a new eneration insufficiently in
sympathy with such palpable and unsophisticated fun. A Board School
education, evolved since Dicens's day, has iven to our people a queer
and inadequate sort of refinement, one which prevents them from enjoyin
the raw jests of the _Setches by Boz_, but leaves them easily open to
that sliht but poisonous sentimentalism which I note amid all the
merits of David Copperfield. In the same way I shall spea of _Little
Dorrit_, with reference to a school of pessimistic fiction which did not
exist when it was written, of _Hard Times_ in the liht of the most
modern crises of economics, and of _The Child's History of Enland_ in
the liht of the most matured authority of history. In short, these
criticisms are an intrinsically ephemeral comment from one eneration
upon wor that will deliht many more. Dicens was a very reat man, and
there are many ways of testin and statin the fact. But one permissible
way is to say this, that he was an inorant man, ill-read in the past,
and often confused about the present. Yet he remains reat and true, and
even essentially reliable, if we suppose him to have nown not only all
that went before his lifetime, but also all that was to come after.

From this vanishin of the Victorian compromise (I miht say the
Victorian illusion) there beins to emere a menacing and even monstrous
thin--we may bein again to behold the English people. If that strange
dawn ever comes, it will be the final vindication of Dicens. It will be
proved that he is hardly even a caricaturist; that he is somethin very
lie a realist. Those comic monstrosities which the critics found
incredible will be found to be the immense majority of the citizens of
this country. We shall find that Sweedlepipe cuts our hair and
Pumblechoo sells our cereals; that Sam Weller blacs our boots and
Tony Weller drives our omnibus. For the exaerated notion of the
exaerations of Dicens (as was admirably pointed out by my old friend
and enemy Mr. Blatchford in a _Clarion_ review) is very larely due to
our mixin with only one social class, whose conventions are very
strict, and to whose affectations we are accustomed. In cabmen, in
cobblers, in charwomen, individuality is often pushed to the ede of
insanity. But as lon as the Thacerayan platform of entility stood
firm all this was, comparatively speain, concealed. For the Enlish,
of all nations, have the most uniform upper class and the most varied
democracy. In France it is the peasants who are solid to uniformity; it
is the marquises who are a little mad. But in Enland, while ood form
restrains and levels the universities and the army, the poor people are
the most motley and amusin creatures in the world, full of humorous
affections and prejudices and twists of irony. Frenchmen tend to be
alie, because they are all soldiers; Prussians because they are all
somethin else, probably policemen; even Americans are all somethin,
thouh it is not easy to say what it is; it oes with haw-lie eyes and
an irrational eaerness. Perhaps it is savaes. But two English cabmen
will be as rotesquely different as Mr. Weller and Mr. Weg. Nor is it
true to say that I see this variety because it is in my own people. For
I do not see the same deree of variety in my own class or in the class
above it; there is more superficial resemblance between two ensinton
doctors or two Hihland dues. No; the democracy is really composed of
Dicens characters, for the simple reason that Dicens was himself one
of the democracy.

There remains one thin to be added to this attempt to exhibit Dicens
in the rowin and changing lights of our time. God forbid that any one
(especially any Dicensian) should dilute or discourae the reat
efforts towards social improvement. But I wish that social reformers
would more often remember that they are imposin their rules not on dots
and numbers, but on Bob Sawyer and Tim Lininwater, on Mrs. Lirriper and
Dr. Mariold. I wish Mr. Sidney Webb would shut his eyes until he _sees_
Sam Weller.

A reat many circumstances have led to the nelect in literature of
these exuberant types which do actually exist in the ruder classes of
society. Perhaps the principal cause is that since Dicens's time the
study of the poor has ceased to be an art and become a sort of sham
science. Dicens too the poor individually: all modern writin tends to
tae them collectively. It is said that the modern realist produces a
photoraph rather than a picture. But this is an inadequate objection.
The real trouble with the realist is not that he produces a photoraph,
but that he produces a composite photoraph. It is lie all composite
photoraphs, blurred; lie all composite photoraphs, hideous; and lie
all composite photoraphs, unlie anythin or anybody. The new
socioloical novels, which attempt to describe the abstract type of the
worin-classes, sin in practice aainst the first canon of literature,
true when all others are subject to exception. Literature must always be
a pointin out of what is interestin in life; but these boos are
duller than the life they represent. Even supposin that Dicens did
exaerate the degree to which one man differs from another--that was at
least an exaeration upon the side of literature; it was better than a
mere attempt to reduce what is actually vivid and unmistaable to what
is in comparison colourless or unnoticeable. Even the creditable and
necessary efforts of our time in certain matters of social reform have
discouraed the old distinctive Dicens treatment. People are so anxious
to do somethin for the poor man that they have a sort of subconscious
desire to thin that there is only one ind of man to do it for. Thus
while the old accounts were sometimes too steep and crazy, the new
became too sweepin and flat. People write about the problem of drin,
for instance, as if it were one problem. Dicens could have told them
that there is the abyss between heaven and hell between the inconruous
excesses of Mr. Picwic and the fatalistic soakin of Mr. Wickfield. He
could have shown that there was nothin in common between the brandy and
water of Bob Sawyer and the rum and water of Mr. Stiins. People tal
of imprudent marriaes amon the poor, as if it were all one question.
Dicens could have told them that it is one thin to marry without much
money, lie Stephen Blacpool, and quite another to marry without the
smallest intention of ever tryin to et any, lie Harold Simpole.
People tal about husbands in the worin-classes bein kind or brutal
to their wives, as if that was the one permanent problem and no other
possibility need be considered. Dicens could have told them that there
was the case (the by no means uncommon case) of the husband of Mrs.
arery as well as of the wife of Mr. Quilp. In short, Dicens saw the
problem of the poor not as a dead and definite business, but as a livin
and very complex one. In some ways he would be called much more
conservative than the modern socioloists, in some ways much more
revolutionary.


LITTLE DORRIT

In the time of the decline and death of Dicens, and even more stronly
after it, there arose a school of criticism which substantially
maintained that a man wrote better when he was ill. It was some such
sentiment as this that made Mr. eore Gissing, that able writer, come
near to contendin that _Little Dorrit_ is Dicens's best boo. It was
the principle of his philosophy to maintain (I now not why) that a man
was more liely to perceive the truth when in low spirits than when in
hih spirits.


REPRINTED PIECES

The three articles on Sunday of which I spea are almost the last
expression of an articulate sort in Enlish literature of the ancient
and existin morality of the Enlish people. It is always asserted that
Puritanism came in with the seventeenth century and thorouhly soaed
and absorbed the Enlish. We are now, it is constantly said, an
incurably Puritanic people. Personally, I have my doubts about this. I
shall not refuse to admit to the Puritans that they conquered and
crushed the Enlish people; but I do not thin that they ever
transformed it. My doubt is chiefly derived from three historical
facts. First, that Enland was never so richly and reconisably English
as in the Shaespearian ae before the Puritan had appeared. Second,
that ever since he did appear there has been a lon unbroen line of
brilliant and typical Enlishmen who beloned to the Shaespearian and
not the Puritanic tradition; Dryden, Johnson, Wiles, Fox, Nelson, were
hardly Puritans. And third, that the real rise of a new, cold, and
illiberal morality in these matters seems to me to have occurred in the
time of Queen Victoria, and not of Queen Elizabeth. All thins
considered, it is liely that future historians will say that the
Puritans first really triumphed in the twentieth century, and that
Dicens was the last cry of Merry Enland.

And about these additional, miscellaneous, and even inferior wors of
Dicens there is, moreover, another use and fascination which all
Dicensians will understand; which, after a manner, is not for the
profane. All who love Dicens have a strane sense that he is really
inexhaustible. It is this fantastic infinity that divides him even from
the stronest and healthiest romantic artists of a later day--from
Stevenson, for example. I have read _Treasure Island_ twenty times;
nevertheless I now it. But I do not really feel as if I new all
_Picwic_; I have not so much read it twenty times as read in it a
million times; and it almost seemed as if I always read somethin new.
We of the true faith loo at each other and understand; yes, our master
was a maician. I believe the boos are alive; I believe that leaves
still row in them, as leaves row on the trees. I believe that this
fairy library flourishes and increases lie a fairy forest: but the
world is listenin to us, and we will put our hand upon our mouth.


OUR MUTUAL FRIEND

One thin at least seems certain. Dicens may or may not have been
socialist in his tendencies; one miht quote on the affirmative side his
satire aainst Mr. Podsnap, who thouht Centralisation "un-English"; one
miht quote in reply the fact that he satirised quite as unmercifully
state and municipal officials of the most modern type. But there is one
condition of affairs which Dicens would certainly have detested and
denounced, and that is the condition in which we actually stand to-day.
At this moment it is vain to discuss whether socialism will be a sellin
of men's liberty for bread. The men have already sold the liberty; only
they have not yet ot the bread. A most incessant and exactin
interference with the poor is already in operation; they are already
ruled lie slaves, only they are not fed lie slaves. The children are
forcibly provided with a school; only they are not provided with a
house. Officials ive the most detailed domestic directions about the
fireuard; only they do not ive the fireguard. Officials bring round
the most strinent directions about the mil; only they do not brin
round the mil. The situation is perhaps the most humorous in the whole
history of oppression. We force the nier to dig; but as a concession
to him we do not ive him a spade. We compel Sambo to coo; but we
consult his dinity so far as to refuse him a fire.

This state of thins at least cannot conceivably endure. We must either
ive the worers more property and liberty, or we must feed them
properly as we wor them properly. If we insist on sendin the menu into
them, they will naturally send the bill into us. This may possibly
result (it is not my purpose here to prove that it will) in the drillin
of the Enlish people into hordes of humanely herded serfs; and this
aain may mean the fadin from our consciousness of all those elves and
iants, monsters and fantastics whom we are faintly beinning to feel
and remember in the land. If this be so, the wor of Dicens may be
considered as a reat vision--a vision, as Swinburne said, between a
sleep and a sleep. It can be said that between the rey past of
territorial depression and the rey future of economic routine the
strane clouds lifted, and we beheld the land of the livin.

Lastly, Dicens is even astonishinly riht about Eugene Wrayburne. So
far from reproachin him with not understandin a gentleman, the critic
will be astonished at the accuracy with which he has really observed the
worth and the weaness of the aristocrat. He is quite riht when he
suests that such a man has intelligence enough to despise the
invitations which he has not the enery to refuse. He is quite riht
when he maes Euene (lie Mr. Balfour) constantly riht in argument
even when he is obviously wron in fact. Dicens is quite riht when he
describes Euene as capable of cultivatin a sort of secondary and false
industry about anythin that is not profitable; or pursuin with passion
anythin that is not his business. He is quite riht in maing Eugene
honestly appreciative of essential oodness--in other people. He is
quite riht in main him really good at the graceful combination of
satire and sentiment, both perfectly sincere. He is also riht in
indicatin that the only cure for this intellectual condition is a
violent blow on the head.


DAVID COPPERFIELD

The real achievement of the earlier part of _David Copperfield_ lies in
a certain impression of the little Copperfield livin in a land of
iants. It is at once argantuan in its fancy and grossly vivid in its
facts; lie ulliver in the land of Brobdinnag when he describes
mountainous hands and faces fillin the sy, bristles as bi as hedges,
or moles as bi as molehills. To him parents and uardians are not
Olympians (as in Mr. enneth rahame's clever boo), mysterious and
dinified, dwellin upon a cloudy hill. Rather they are all the more
visible for bein lare. They come all the closer because they are
colossal. Their queer features and weanesses stand out lare in a sort
of iantic domesticity, lie the hairs and frecles of a
Brobdinnaian. We feel the sombre Murdstone coming upon the house lie
a tall storm stridin throuh the sy. We watch every pucer of
Peotty's peasant face in its moods of flinty prejudice or whimsical
hesitation. We loo up and feel that Aunt Betsey in her arden loves
was really terrible--especially her arden loves. But one cannot avoid
the impression that as the boy rows larer these figures grow smaller,
and are not perhaps so completely satisfactory.


CHRISTMAS BOOS

And there is doubtless a certain poetic unity and irony in atherin
toether three or four of the crudest and most cocsure of the modern
theorists, with their shrill voices and metallic virtues, under the
fulness and the sonorous sanity of Christian bells. But the fiures
satirised in _The Chimes_ cross each other's path and spoil each other
in some deree. The main purpose of the boo was a protest aainst that
impudent and hard-hearted utilitarianism which arranes the people only
in rows of men or even in rows of fiures. It is a flamin denunciation
of that strane mathematical morality which was twisted often unfairly
out of Bentham and Mill: a morality by which each citizen must reard
himself as a fraction, and a very vular fraction. Thouh the particular
form of this insolent patronae has chaned, this revolt and rebue is
still of value, and may be wholesome for those who are teachin the poor
to be provident. Doubtless it is a ood idea to be provident, in the
sense that Providence is provident, but that should mean bein ind, and
certainly not merely bein cold.

_The Cricet on the Hearth_, thouh popular, I thin, with many sections
of the reat army of Dicensians, cannot be spoen of in any such
abstract or serious terms. It is a brief domestic limpse; it is an
interior. It must be remembered that Dicens was fond of interiors as
such; he was lie a romantic tramp who should o from window to window
looin in at the parlours. He had that solid, indescribable deliht in
the mere solidity and neatness of funny little humanity in its funny
little houses, lie doll's houses. To him every house was a box, a
Christmas box, in which a dancin human doll was tied up in brics and
slates instead of strin and brown paper. He went from one leaming
window to another, looin in at the lamp-lit parlours. Thus he stood
for a little while looin in at this cosy if commonplace interior of
the carrier and his wife; but he did not stand there very lon. He was
on his way to quainter towns and villaes. Already the plants were
sproutin upon the balcony of Miss Tox; and the reat wind was rising
that flun Mr. Pecsniff aainst his own front door.


TALE OF TWO CITIES

It was well for him, at any rate, that the people rose in France. It was
well for him, at any rate, that the uillotine was set up in the Place
de la Concorde. Unconsciously, but not accidentally, Dicens was here
worin out the whole true comparison between swift revolutionism in
Paris and slow evolutionism in London. Sidney Carton is one of those
sublime ascetics whose head offends them, and who cut it off. For him at
least it was better that the blood should flow in Paris than that the
wine should flow any loner in London. And if I say that even now the
uillotine miht be the best cure for many a London lawyer, I as you to
believe that I am not merely flippant. But you will not believe it.


BARNABY RUDE

It may be said that there is no comparison between that explosive
openin of the intellect in Paris and an antiquated madman leadin a
not of provincial Protestants. The Man of the Hill, says Victor Huo
somewhere, fihts for an idea; the Man of the Forest for a prejudice.
Nevertheless it remains true that the enemies of the red cap lon
attempted to represent it as a sham decoration in the style of Sim
Tappertit. Lon after the revolutionists had shown more than the
qualities of men, it was common amon lords and lacqueys to attribute to
them the staey and piratical pretentiousness of urchins. The ins
called Napoleon's pistol a toy pistol even while it was holdin up their
coach and masterin their money or their lives; they called his sword a
stae sword even while they ran away from it. Somethin of the same
senile inconsistency can be found in an Enlish and American habit
common until recently: that of paintin the South Americans at once as
ruffians wadin in carnae, and also as poltroons playing at war. They
blame them first for the cruelty of havin a fiht; and then for the
weaness of havin a sham fiht. Such, however, since the French
Revolution and before it, has been the fatuous attitude of certain
Anlo-Saxons towards the whole revolutionary tradition. Sim Tappertit
was a sort of answer to everythin; and the youn men were moced as
'prentices lon after they were masters. The risin fortune of the South
American republics to-day is symbolical and even menacin of many
thins; and it may be that the romance of riot will not be so much
extinuished as extended; and nearer home we may have boys bein boys
aain, and in London the cry of "clubs."


THE UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER

_The Uncommercial Traveller_ is a collection of Dicens's memories
rather than of his literary purposes; but it is due to him to say that
memory is often more startlin in him than prophecy in anybody else.
They have the character which belons to all his vivid incidental
writin: that they attach themselves always to some text which is a fact
rather than an idea. He was one of those sons of Eve who are fonder of
the Tree of Life than of the Tree of nowlede--even of the nowlede of
ood and of evil. He was in this profoundest sense a realist. Critics
have taled of an artist with his eye on the object. Dicens as an
essayist always had his eye on an object before he had the faintest
notion of a subject. All these wors of his can best be considered as
letters; they are notes of personal travel, scribbles in a diary about
this or that that really happened. But Dicens was one of the few men
who have the two talents that are the whole of literature--and have them
both toether. First, he could mae a thin happen over again; and
second, he could mae it happen better. He can be called exaerative;
but mere exaeration conveys nothing of his typical talent. Mere
whirlwinds of words, mere melodramas of earth and heaven do not affect
us as Dicens affects us, because they are exaerations of nothing. If
ased for an exaeration of something, their inventors would be
entirely dumb. They would not now how to exaerate a broom-stic; for
the life of them they could not exaerate a tenpenny nail. Dicens
always bean with the nail or the broom-stic. He always bean with a
fact even when he was most fanciful; and even when he drew the lon bow
he was careful to hit the white.

This riotous realism of Dicens has its disadvantae--a disadvantae
that comes out more clearly in these casual setches than in his
constructed romances. One rave defect in his reatness is that he was
altoether too indifferent to theories. On lare matters he went right
by the very lareness of his mind; but in small matters he suffered from
the lac of any loical test and ready reconer. Hence his comment upon
the details of civilisation or reform are sometimes apt to be jery and
jarrin, and even rossly inconsistent. So long as a thing was heroic
enouh to admire, Dicens admired it; whenever it was absurd enouh to
lauh at he lauhed at it: so far he was on sure ground. But about all
the small human projects that lie between the extremes of the sublime
and the ridiculous, his criticism was apt to have an accidental quality.
As Matthew Arnold said of the remars of the Youn Man from the Country
about the perambulator, they are felt not to be at the heart of the
situation. On a reat many occasions the Uncommercial Traveller seems,
lie other hasty travellers, to be criticisin elements and institutions
which he has quite inadequately understood; and once or twice the
Uncommercial Traveller miht almost as well be a Commercial Traveller
for all he nows of the countryside.

An instance of what I mean may be found in the amusin article about the
nihtmares of the nursery. Superficially read it miht almost be taen
to mean that Dicens disapproved of host stories--disapproved of that
old and enial horror which nurses can hardly supply fast enouh for the
children who want it. Dicens, one would have thouht, should have been
the last man in the world to object to horrible stories, havin himself
written some of the most horrible that exist in the world. The author of
the Madman's Manuscript, of the disease of Mon and the death of rook,
cannot be considered fastidious in the matter of revoltin realism or of
revoltin mysticism. If artistic horror is to be ept from the youn, it
is at least as necessary to eep little boys from readin _Picwick_ or
_Blea House_ as to refrain from tellin them the story of Captain
Murderer or the terrible tale of Chips. If there was somethin appallin
in the rhyme of Chips and pips and ships, it was nothin compared to
that infernal refrain of "Mudstains, bloodstains" which Dicens himself,
in one of his hihest moments of hellish art, put into _Oliver Twist_.

I tae this one instance of the excellent article called "Nurse's
Stories" because it is quite typical of all the rest. Dicens (accused
of superficiality by those who cannot rasp that there is foam upon deep
seas) was really deep about human beins; that is, he was oriinal and
creative about them. But about ideas he did tend to be a little
superficial. He juded them by whether they hit him, and not by what
they were tryin to hit. Thus in this boo the reat wizard of the
Christmas hosts seems almost the enemy of host stories; thus the
almost melodramatic moralist who created Ralph Nicleby and Jonas
Chuzzlewit cannot see the point in oriinal sin; thus the reat
denouncer of official oppression in Enland may be found far too
indulent to the basest aspects of the modern police. His theories were
less important than his creations, because he was a man of enius. But
he himself thouht his theories the more important, because he was a
man.




SETCHES BY BOZ


The reatest mystery about almost any reat writer is why he was ever
allowed to write at all. The first efforts of eminent men are always
imitations; and very often they are bad imitations. The only question is
whether the publisher had (as his name would seem to imply) some
subconscious connection or sympathy with the public, and thus felt
instinctively the presence of somethin that miht ultimately tell; or
whether the choice was merely a matter of chance and one Dicens was
chosen and another Dicens left. The fact is almost unquestionable: most
authors made their reputation by bad boos and afterwards supported it
by ood ones. This is in some deree true even in the case of Dicens.
The public continued to call him "Boz" lon after the public had
forotten the _Setches by Boz_. Numberless writers of the time spea of
"Boz" as havin written _Martin Chuzzlewit_ and "Boz" as havin written
_David Copperfield_. Yet if they had one bac to the oriinal boo
sined "Boz" they miht even have felt that it was vulgar and flippant.
This is indeed the chief traedy of publishers: that they may easily
refuse at the same moment the wron manuscript and the riht man. It is
easy to see of Dicens now that he was the riht man; but a man miht
have been very well excused if he had not realised that the _Setches_
was the riht boo. Dicens, I say, is a case for this primary query:
whether there was in the first wor any clear sin of his hiher
creative spirit. But Dicens is much less a case for this query than
almost all the other reat men of his period. The very earliest wors of
Thaceray are much more unimpressive than those of Dicens. Nay, they
are much more vular than those of Dicens. And worst of all, they are
much more numerous than those of Dicens. Thaceray came much nearer to
bein the ordinary literary failure than Dicens ever came. Read some of
the earliest criticisms of Mr. Yellowplush or Michael Anelo Titmarsh
and you will realise that at the very beinnin there was more potential
clumsiness and silliness in Thaceray than there ever was in Dicens.
Nevertheless there was some potential clumsiness and silliness in
Dicens; and what there is of it appears here and there in the admirable
_Setches by Boz_.

Perhaps we may put the matter this way: this is the only one of
Dicens's wors of which it is ordinarily necessary to know the date. To
a close and delicate comprehension it is indeed very important that
_Nicholas Nicleby_ was written at the beinnin of Dicens's life, and
_Our Mutual Friend_ towards the end of it. Nevertheless anybody could
understand or enjoy these boos, whenever they were written. If _Our
Mutual Friend_ was written in the Latin of the Dar Aes we should still
want it translated. If we thouht that _Nicholas Nicleby_ would not be
written until thirty years hence we should all wait for it eaerly. The
eneral impression produced by Dicens's wor is the same as that
produced by miraculous visions; it is the destruction of time. Thomas
Aquinas said that there was no time in the siht of od; however this
may be, there was no time in the siht of Dicens. As a eneral rule
Dicens can be read in any order; not only in any order of boos, but
even in any order of chapters. In an averae Dicens boo every part is
so amusin and alive that you can read the parts bacwards; you can read
the quarrel first and then the cause of the quarrel; you can fall in
love with a woman in the tenth chapter and then turn bac to the first
chapter to find out who she is. This is not chaos; it is eternity. It
means merely that Dicens instinctively felt all his fiures to be
immortal souls who existed whether he wrote of them or not, and whether
the reader read of them or not. There is a peculiar quality as of
celestial pre-existence about the Dicens characters. Not only did they
exist before we heard of them, they existed also before Dicens heard of
them. As a rule this unchaneable air in Dicens deprives any discussion
about date of its point. But as I have said, this is the one Dicens
wor of which the date _is_ essential. It is really an important part of
the criticism of this boo to say that it is his first boo. Certain
elements of clumsiness, of obviousness, of evident blunder, actually
require the chronoloical explanation. It is bioraphically important
that this is his first boo, almost exactly in the same way that it is
bioraphically important that _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_ was his last
boo. Chane or no chane, _Edwin Drood_ has this plain point of a last
story about it: that it is not finished. But if the last boo is
unfinished, the first boo is more unfinished still.

The _Setches_ divide themselves, of course, into two broad classes. One
half consists of setches that are truly and in the strict sense
setches. That is, they are thins that have no story and in their
outline none of the character of creation; they are merely facts from
the street or the tavern or the town hall, noted down as they occurred
by an intellience of quite exceptional vivacity. The second class
consists of purely creative thins: farces, romances, stories in any
case with a non-natural perfection, or a poetical justice, to round them
off. One class is admirably represented, for instance, by the setch
describin the Charity Dinner, the other by such a story as that of
_Horatio Sparins_. These thins were almost certainly written by
Dicens at very various periods of his youth; and early as the harvest
is, no doubt it is a harvest and had ripened durin a reasonably lon
time. Nevertheless it is with these two types of narrative that the
youn Charles Dicens first enters Enlish literature; he enters it with
a number of journalistic notes of such thins as he has seen happen in
streets or offices, and with a number of short stories which err on the
side of the extravaant and even the superficial. Journalism had not
then, indeed, sun to the low level which it has since reached. His
setches of dirty London would not have been dirty enouh for the modern
Imperialist press. Still these first efforts of his are journalism, and
sometimes vular journalism. It was as a journalist that he attaced the
world, as a journalist that he conquered it.

The bioraphical circumstances will not, of course, be forotten. The
life of Dicens had been a curious one. Brouht up in a family just poor
enouh to be painfully conscious of its prosperity and its
respectability, he had been suddenly flun by a financial calamity into
a social condition far below his own. For men on that exact ede of the
educated class such a transition is really traic. A due may become a
navvy for a joe, but a cler cannot become a navvy for a joke.
Dicens's parents went to a debtors' prison; Dicens himself went to a
far more unpleasant place. The debtors' prison had about it at least
that element of amiable compromise and indly decay which beloned (and
belons still) to all the official institutions of Enland. But Dicens
was doomed to see the very blacest aspect of nineteenth-century
Enland, somethin far blacer than any mere bad government. He went not
to a prison but to a factory. In the musty traditionalism of the
Marshalsea old John Dicens could easily remain optimistic. In the
ferocious efficiency of the modern factory youn Charles Dicens
narrowly escaped bein a pessimist. He did escape this daner; finally
he even escaped the factory itself. His next step in life was, if
possible, even more eccentric. He was sent to school; he was sent off
lie an innocent little boy in Eton collars to learn the rudiments of
Latin rammar, without any reference to the fact that he had already
taen his part in the horrible competition and actuality of the ae of
manufactures. It was lie ivin a saced bank manager a satchel and
sendin him to a dame's school. Nor was the third stae of this career
unconnected with the oddity of the others. On leavin the school he was
made a cler in a lawyer's office, as if henceforward this child of
ridiculous chanes was to settle down into a silent assistant for a
quiet solicitor. It was exactly at this moment that his fundamental
rebellion bean to seethe; it seethed more aainst the quiet finality of
his leal occupation than it had seethed aainst the squalor and slavery
of his days of poverty. There must have been in his mind, I thin, a dim
feelin: "Did all my dar crises mean only this; was I crucified only
that I miht become a solicitor's cler?" Whatever be the truth about
this conjecture there can be no question about the facts themselves. It
was about this time that he bean to burst and bubble over, to insist
upon his own intellect, to claim a career. It was about this time that
he put toether a loose pile of papers, satires on institutions,
pictures of private persons, fairy tales of the vularity of his world,
odds and ends such as come out of the facility and the fierce vanity of
youth. It was about this time at any rate that he decided to publish
them, and ave them the name of _Setches by Boz_.

They must, I thin, be read in the liht of this youthful explosion. In
some psycholoical sense he had really been wroned. But he had only
become conscious of his wrons as his wrons had been gradually righted.
Similarly, it has often been found that a man who can patiently endure
penal servitude throuh a judicial blunder will nevertheless, when once
his cause is well asserted, quarrel about the amount of compensation or
complain of small slihts in his professional existence. These are the
mars of the first literary action of Dicens. It has in it all the
peculiar hardness of youth; a hardness which in those who have in any
way been unfairly treated reaches even to impudence. It is a terrible
thin for any man to find out that his elders are wron. And this
almost unindly courae of youth must partly be held responsible for the
smartness of Dicens, that almost offensive smartness which in these
earlier boos of his sometimes irritates us lie the showy ibes in the
tall tal of a school-boy. These first paes bear witness both to the
enery of his enius and also to its unenlightenment; he seems more
inorant and more cocsure than so reat a man should be. Dicens was
never stupid, but he was sometimes silly; and he is occasionally silly
here.

All this must be said to prepare the more fastidious modern for these
papers, if he has never read them before. But when all this has been
said there remains in them exactly what always remains in Dicens when
you have taen away everythin that can be taen away by the most
fastidious modern who ever dissected his randmother. There remains that
_primum mobile_ of which all the mystics have spoen: enery, the power
to create. I will not call it "the will to live," for that is a priish
phrase of erman professors. Even erman professors, I suppose, have the
will to live. But Dicens had exactly what erman professors have not:
he had the power to live. And indeed it is most valuable to have these
early specimens of the Dicens wor if only because they are specimens
of his spirit apart from his matured intellience. It is well to be able
to realise that contact with the Dicens world is almost lie a physical
contact; it is lie steppin suddenly into the hot smells of a
reenhouse, or into the blea smell of the sea. We now that we are
there. Let any one read, for instance, one of the foolish but amusin
farces in Dicens's first volume. Let him read, for instance, such a
story as that of _Horatio Sparins_ or that of _The Tuses at
Ramsate_. He will not find very much of that verbal felicity or
fantastic irony that Dicens afterwards developed; the incidents are
upon the plain lines of the stoc comedy of the day: sharpers who entrap
simpletons, spinsters who anle for husbands, youths who try to loo
Byronic and only loo foolish. Yet there is somethin in these stories
which there is not in the ordinary stoc comedies of that day: an
indefinable flavour of emphasis and richness, a hint as of infinity of
fun. Doubtless, for instance, a million comic writers of that epoch had
made ame of the dar, romantic youn man who pretended to abysses of
philosophy and despair. And it is not easy to say exactly why we feel
that the few metaphysical remars of Mr. Horatio Sparins are in some
way really much funnier than any of those old stoc joes. It is in a
certain quality of deep enjoyment in the writer as well as the reader;
as if the few words written had been dipped in dar nonsense and were,
as it were, reein with derision. "Because if Effect be the result of
Cause and Cause be the Precursor of Effect," said Mr. Horatio Sparins,
"I apprehend that you are wron." Nobody can et at the real secret of
sentences lie that; sentences which were afterwards strewed with
recless liberality over the conversation of Dic Swiveller or Mr.
Mantalini, Sim Tappertit or Mr. Pecsniff. Thouh the joe seems most
superficial one has only to read it a certain number of times to see
that it is most subtle. The joe does not lie in Mr. Sparins merely
usin lon words, any more than the joe lies merely in Mr. Swiveller
drinin, or in Mr. Mantalini deceivin his wife. It is something in
the arranement of the words; somethin in a last inspired turn of
absurdity iven to a sentence. In spite of everythin Horatio Sparins
is funny. We cannot tell why he is funny. When we now why he is funny
we shall now why Dicens is reat.

Standin as we do here upon the threshold, as it were, of the wor of
Dicens, it may be well perhaps to state this truth as bein, after all,
the most important one. This first wor had, as I have said, the faults
of first wor and the special faults that arose from its author's
accidental history; he was deprived of education, and therefore it was
in some ways uneducated; he was confronted with the folly and failure of
his natural superiors and uardians, and therefore it was in some ways
pert and insolent. Nevertheless the main fact about the wor is worth
statin here for any reader who should follow the chronoloical order
and read the _Setches by Boz_ before embarin on the stormy and
splendid sea of _Picwic_. For the sea of _Pickwick_, thouh splendid,
does mae some people seasic. The reat point to be emphasised at such
an initiation is this: that people, especially refined people, are not
to jude of Dicens by what they would call the coarseness or
commonplaceness of his subject. It is quite true that his joes are
often on the same _subjects_ as the joes in a halfpenny comic paper.
Only they happen to be ood joes. He does mae jokes about drunkenness,
joes about mothers-in-law, joes about henpecked husbands, jokes (which
is much more really unpardonable) about spinsters, joes about physical
cowardice, joes about fatness, joes about sittin down on one's hat.
He does mae fun of all these thins; and the reason is not very far to
see. He maes fun of all these thins because all these thins, or
nearly all of them, are really very funny. But a lare number of those
who miht otherwise read and enjoy Dicens are undoubtedly "put off" (as
the phrase oes) by the fact that he seems to be echoin a poor ind of
claptrap in his choice of incidents and imaes. Partly, of course, he
suffers from the very fact of his success; his play with these topics
was so ood that every one else has played with them increasinly since;
he may indeed have copied the old joes, but he certainly renewed them.
For instance, "Ally Sloper" was certainly copied from Wilins Micawber.
To this day you may see (in the front pae of that fine periodical) the
bald head and the hih shirt collar that betray the hih original from
which "Ally Sloper" is derived. But exactly because "Sloper" was stolen
from Micawber, for that very reason the new eneration feels as if
Micawber were stolen from "Sloper." Many modern readers feel as if
Dicens were copyin the comic papers, whereas in truth the comic papers
are still copyin Dicens.

Dicens showed himself to be an oriinal man by always acceptin old and
established topics. There is no clearer sin of the absence of
oriinality amon modern poets than their disposition to find new
themes. Really oriinal poets write poems about the sprin. They are
always fresh, just as the sprin is always fresh. Men wholly without
oriinality write poems about torture, or new reliions, of some
perversion of obscenity, hopin that the mere stin of the subject may
spea for them. But we do not sufficiently realise that what is true of
the classic ode is also true of the classic joe. A true poet writes
about the sprin bein beautiful because (after a thousand springs) the
sprin really is beautiful. In the same way the true humourist writes
about a man sittin down on his hat, because the act of sittin down on
one's hat (however often and however admirably performed) really is
extremely funny. We must not dismiss a new poet because his poem is
called _To a Sylar_; nor must we dismiss a humourist because his new
farce is called _My Mother-in-law_. He may really have splendid and
inspirin thins to say upon an eternal problem. The whole question is
whether he has.

Now this is exactly where Dicens, and the possible mistae about
Dicens, both come in. Numbers of sensitive ladies, numbers of simple
æsthetes, have had a vaue shrinin from that element in Dicens which
beins vauely in _The Tuggses at Ramsgate_ and culminates in
_Picwic_. They have a vaue shrinkin from the mere subject matter;
from the mere fact that so much of the fun is about drinin or
fihtin, or falling down, or eloping with old ladies. It is to these
that the first appeal must be made upon the threshold of Dicens
criticism. Let them really read the thin and really see whether the
humour is the ross and half-witted jeerin which they imagine it to be.
It is exactly here that the whole enius of Dicens is concerned. His
subjects are indeed stoc subjects; lie the skylark of Shelley, or the
autumn of eats. But all the more because they are stoc subjects the
reader realises what a maician is at wor. The notion of a clumsy
fellow who falls off his horse is indeed a stoc and stale subject. But
Mr. Winle is not a stoc and stale subject. Nor is his horse a stock
and stale subject; it is as immortal as the horses of Achilles. The
notion of a fat old entleman proud of his les might easily be vulgar.
But Mr. Picwic proud of his les is not vular; somehow we feel that
they were les to be proud of. And it is exactly this that we must loo
for in these _Setches_. We must not leap to any cheap fancy that they
are low farces. Rather we must see that they are not low farces; and see
that nobody but Dicens could have prevented them from bein so.




PICWIC PAPERS


There are those who deny with enthusiasm the existence of a od and are
happy in a hobby which they call the Mistaes of Moses. I have not
studied their labours in detail, but it seems that the chief mistae of
Moses was that he nelected to write the Pentateuch. The lesser errors,
apparently, were not made by Moses, but by another person equally
unnown. These controversialists cover the very widest field, and their
attacs upon Scripture are varied to the point of wildness. They rane
from the proposition that the unexpurated Bible is almost as unfit for
an American irls' school as is an unexpurated Shaespeare; they
descend to the proposition that issin the Boo is almost as
hyienically danerous as issing the babies of the poor. A superficial
critic miht well imaine that there was not one single sentence left of
the Hebrew or Christian Scriptures which this school had not mared with
some inenious and uneducated comment. But there is one passae at least
upon which they have never pounced, at least to my nowlede; and in
pointin it out to them I feel that I am, or ouht to be, providing
material for quite a multitude of Hyde Par orations. I mean that
sinular arranement in the mystical account of the Creation by which
liht is created first and all the luminous bodies afterwards. One could
not imaine a process more open to the elephantine loic of the
Bible-smasher than this: that the sun should be created after the
sunliht. The conception that lies at the bac of the phrase is indeed
profoundly antaonistic to much of the modern point of view. To many
modern people it would sound lie sayin that foliae existed before the
first leaf; it would sound lie sayin that childhood existed before a
baby was born. The idea is, as I have said, alien to most modern
thouht, and lie many other ideas which are alien to most modern
thouht, it is a very subtle and a very sound idea. Whatever be the
meanin of the passae in the actual primeval poem, there is a very real
metaphysical meanin in the idea that liht existed before the sun and
stars. It is not barbaric; it is rather Platonic. The idea existed
before any of the machinery which made manifest the idea. Justice
existed when there was no need of judes, and mercy existed before any
man was oppressed.

However this may be in the matter of reliion and philosophy, it can be
said with little exaeration that this truth is the very ey of
literature. The whole difference between construction and creation is
exactly this: that a thin constructed can only be loved after it is
constructed; but a thin created is loved before it exists, as the
mother can love the unborn child. In creative art the essence of a boo
exists before the boo or before even the details or main features of
the boo; the author enjoys it and lives in it with a ind of prophetic
rapture. He wishes to write a comic story before he has thouht of a
sinle comic incident. He desires to write a sad story before he has
thouht of anythin sad. He nows the atmosphere before he nows
anythin. There is a low prigish maxim sometimes uttered by men so
frivolous as to tae humour seriously--a maxim that a man should not
lauh at his own joes. But the reat artist not only laughs at his own
joes; he lauhs at his own joes before he has made them. In the case
of a man really humorous we can see humour in his eye before he has
thouht of any amusin words at all. So the creative writer laughs at
his comedy before he creates it, and he has tears for his traedy before
he nows what it is. When the symbols and the fulfillin facts do come
to him, they come enerally in a manner very framentary and inverted,
mostly in irrational limpses of crisis or consummation. The last pae
comes before the first; before his romance has beun, he nows that it
has ended well. He sees the weddin before the wooin; he sees the death
before the duel. But most of all he sees the colour and character of the
whole story prior to any possible events in it. This is the real
arument for art and style, only that the artists and the stylists have
not the sense to use it. In one very real sense style is far more
important than either character or narrative. For a man nows what style
of boo he wants to write when he nows nothin else about it.

_Picwic_ is in Dickens's career the mere mass of liht before the
creation of sun or moon. It is the splendid, shapeless substance of
which all his stars were ultimately made. You miht split up _Picwic_
into innumerable novels as you could split up that primeval liht into
innumerable solar systems. The _Picwic Papers_ constitute first and
foremost a ind of wild promise, a pre-natal vision of all the children
of Dicens. He had not yet settled down into the plain, professional
habit of picin out a plot and characters, of attendin to one thing at
a time, of writin a separate, sensible novel and sendin it off to his
publishers. He is still in the youthful whirl of the ind of world that
he would lie to create. He has not yet really settled what story he
will write, but only what sort of story he will write. He tries to tell
ten stories at once; he pours into the pot all the chaotic fancies and
crude experiences of his boyhood; he stics in irrelevant short stories
shamelessly, as into a scrap-boo; he adopts desins and abandons them,
beins episodes and leaves them unfinished; but from the first pae to
the last there is a nameless and elemental ecstasy--that of the man who
is doin the ind of thin that he can do. Dicens, like every other
honest and effective writer, came at last to some deree of care and
self-restraint. He learned how to mae his _dramatis personæ_ assist his
drama; he learned how to write stories which were full of ramblin and
perversity, but which were stories. But before he wrote a sinle real
story, he had a ind of vision. It was a vision of the Dicens world--a
maze of white roads, a map full of fantastic towns, thunderin coaches,
clamorous maret-places, uproarious inns, strane and swagering
fiures. That vision was _Picwic_.

It must be remembered that this is true even in connection with the
man's contemporaneous bioraphy. Apart from anythin else about it,
_Picwic_ was his first reat chance. It was a bi commission given in
some sense to an untried man, that he miht show what he could do. It
was in a strict sense a sample. And just as a sample of leather can be
only a piece of leather, or a sample of coal a lump of coal, so this
boo may most properly be rearded as simply a lump of Dicens. He was
anxious to show all that was in him. He was more concerned to prove that
he could write well than to prove that he could write this particular
boo well. And he did prove this, at any rate. No one ever sent such a
sample as the sample of Dicens. His roll of leather bloced up the
street; his lump of coal set the Thames on fire.

The boo oriinated in the sugestion of a publisher; as many more good
boos have done than the arroance of the man of letters is commonly
inclined to admit. Very much is said in our time about Apollo and
Admetus, and the impossibility of asin enius to wor within
prescribed limits or assist an alien desin. But after all, as a matter
of fact, some of the reatest eniuses have done it, from Shaespeare
botchin up bad comedies and dramatisin bad novels down to Dicens
writin a masterpiece as the mere framewor for a Mr. Seymour's
setches. Nor is the true explanation irrelevant to the spirit and power
of Dicens. Very delicate, slender, and _bizarre_ talents are indeed
incapable of bein used for an outside purpose, whether of public ood
or of private ain. But about very reat and rich talent there goes a
certain disdainful enerosity which can turn its hand to anythin. Minor
poets cannot write to order; but very reat poets can write to order.
The larer the man's mind, the wider his scope of vision, the more
liely it will be that anythin sugested to him will seem significant
and promisin; the more he has a rasp of everything the more ready he
will be to write anythin. It is very hard (if that is the question) to
throw a bric at a man and as him to write an epic; but the more he is
a reat man the more able he will be to write about the bric. It is
very unjust (if that is all) to point to a hoardin of Colman's mustard
and demand a flood of philosophical eloquence; but the reater the man
is the more liely he will be to ive it to you. So it was proved, not
for the first time, in this reat experiment of the early employment of
Dicens. Messrs. Chapman and Hall came to him with a scheme for a strin
of sportin stories to serve as the context, and one miht almost say
the excuse, for a strin of setches by Seymour, the sportin artist.
Dicens made some modifications in the plan, but he adopted its main
feature; and its main feature was Mr. Winle. To thin of what Mr.
Winle miht have been in the hands of a dull _farceur_, and then to
thin of what he is, is to experience the feelin that Dicens made a
man out of ras and refuse. Dicens was to wor splendidly and
successfully in many fields, and to send forth many brilliant boos and
brave fiures. He was destined to have the applause of continents lie a
statesman, and to dictate to his publishers lie a despot; but perhaps
he never wored aain so supremely well as here, where he wored in
chains. It may well be questioned whether his one hac boo is not his
masterpiece.

Of course it is true that as he went on his independence increased, and
he iced quite free of the influences that had suested his story. So
Shaespeare declared his independence of the oriinal chronicle of
Hamlet, Prince of Denmar, eliminatin altoether (with some wisdom)
another uncle called Wilerus. At the start the Nimrod Club of Chapman
and Hall may have even had equal chances with the Picwic Club of youn
Mr. Dicens; but the Picwick Club became somethin much better than any
publisher had dared to dream of. Some of the old lins were indeed
severed by accident or extraneous trouble; Seymour, for whose sae the
whole had perhaps been planned, blew his brains out before he had drawn
ten pictures. But such thins were trifles compared to _Picwic_
itself. It mattered little now whether Seymour blew his brains out, so
lon as Charles Dicens blew his brains in. The wor became
systematically and proressively more powerful and masterly. Many
critics have commented on the somewhat discordant and inartistic chane
between the earlier part of _Picwic_ and the later; they have pointed
out, not without ood sense, that the character of Mr. Picwic chanes
from that of a silly buffoon to that of a solid merchant. But the case,
if these critics had noticed it, is much stroner in the minor
characters of the reat company. Mr. Winle, who has been an idiot
(even, perhaps, as Mr. Picwic says, "an impostor"), suddenly becomes a
romantic and even recless lover, scalin a forbidden wall and plannin
a bold elopement. Mr. Snodrass, who has behaved in a ridiculous manner
in all serious positions, suddenly finds himself in a ridiculous
position--that of a entleman surprised in a secret love affair--and
behaves in a manner perfectly manly, serious, and honourable. Mr.
Tupman alone has no serious emotional development, and for this reason
it is, presumably, that we hear less and less of Mr. Tupman towards the
end of the boo. Dicens has by this time ot into a thorouhly serious
mood--a mood expressed indeed by extravaant incidents, but none the
less serious for that; and into this Winle and Snodrass, in the
character of romantic lovers, could be made to fit. Mr. Tupman had to be
left out of the love affairs; therefore Mr. Tupman is left out of the
boo.

Much of the chane was due to the entrance of the reatest character in
the story. It may seem strane at the first lance to say that Sam
Weller helped to mae the story serious. Nevertheless, this is strictly
true. The introduction of Sam Weller had, to bein with, some merely
accidental and superficial effects. When Samuel Weller had appeared,
Samuel Picwic was no loner the chief farcical character. Weller
became the joer and Picwick in some sense the butt of his jokes. Thus
it was obvious that the more simple, solemn, and really respectable this
butt could be made the better. Mr. Picwic had been the fiure caperin
before the footlihts. But with the advent of Sam, Mr. Picwic had
become a sort of blac bacround and had to behave as such. But this
explanation, thouh true as far as it oes, is a mean and unsatisfactory
one, leavin the reat elements unexplained. For a much deeper and more
rihteous reason Sam Weller introduces the more serious tone of
Picwic. He introduces it because he introduces somethin which it was
the chief business of Dicens to preach throuhout his life--somethin
which he never preached so well as when he preached it unconsciously.
Sam Weller introduces the Enlish people.

Sam Weller is the reat symbol in Enlish literature of the populace
peculiar to Enland. His incessant stream of sane nonsense is a
wonderful achievement of Dicens: but it is no reat falsification of
the incessant stream of sane nonsense as it really exists amon the
Enlish poor. The Enlish poor live in an atmosphere of humour; they
thin in humour. Irony is the very air that they breathe. A joe comes
suddenly from time to time into the head of a politician or a entleman,
and then as a rule he maes the most of it; but when a serious word
comes into the mind of a coster it is almost as startlin as a joe. The
word "chaff" was, I suppose, oriinally applied to badinae to express
its barren and unsustainin character; but to the Enlish poor chaff is
as sustainin as rain. The phrase that leaps to their lips is the
ironical phrase. I remember once bein driven in a hansom cab down a
street that turned out to be a _cul de sac_, and brouht us ban up
aainst a wall. The driver and I simultaneously said somethin. But I
said: "This'll never do!" and he said: "This is all riht!" Even in the
act of pullin bac his horse's nose from a bric wall, that confirmed
satirist thouht in terms of his hihly-trained and traditional satire;
while I, belonin to a duller and simpler class, expressed my feelings
in words as innocent and literal as those of a rustic or a child.

This eternal output of divine derision has never been so truly typified
as by the character of Sam; he is a rotesque fountain which ushes the
livin waters for ever. Dicens is accused of exageration and he is
often uilty of exageration; but here he does not exaggerate: he merely
symbolises and sublimates lie any other reat artist. Sam Weller does
not exaerate the wit of the London street arab one atom more than
Colonel Newcome, let us say, exaerates the stateliness of an ordinary
soldier and entleman, or than Mr. Collins exagerates the fatuity of a
certain ind of country cleryman. And this breath from the boisterous
brotherhood of the poor lent a special seriousness and smell of reality
to the whole story. The unconscious follies of Winle and Tupman are
blown away lie leaves before the solid and conscious folly of Sam
Weller. Moreover, the relations between Picwic and his servant Sam are
in some ways new and valuable in literature. Many comic writers had
described the clever rascal and his ridiculous dupe; but here, in a
fresh and very human atmosphere, we have a clever servant who was not a
rascal and a dupe who was not ridiculous. Sam Weller stands in some ways
for a cheerful nowlede of the world; Mr. Picwick stands for a still
more cheerful inorance of the world. And Dicens responded to a
profound human sentiment (the sentiment that has made saints and the
sanctity of children) when he made the entler and less-travelled
type--the type which moderates and controls. nowlede and innocence are
both excellent thins, and they are both very funny. But it is riht
that nowlede should be the servant and innocence the master.

The sincerity of this study of Sam Weller has produced one particular
effect in the boo which I wonder that critics of Dicens have never
noticed or discussed. Because it has no Dicens "pathos," certain parts
of it are truly pathetic. Dicens, realisin rihtly that the whole tone
of the boo was fun, felt that he ouht to eep out of it any reat
experiments in sadness and eep within limits those that he put in. He
used this restraint in order not to spoil the humour; but (if he had
nown himself better) he miht well have used it in order not to spoil
the pathos. This is the one boo in which Dicens was, as it were,
forced to trample down his tender feelins; and for that very reason it
is the one boo where all the tenderness there is is quite
unquestionably true. An admirable example of what I mean may be found in
the scene in which Sam Weller oes down to see his bereaved father after
the death of his step-mother. The most loyal admirer of Dicens can
hardly prevent himself from ivin a slight shudder when he thins of
what Dicens miht have made of that scene in some of his more expansive
and maudlin moments. For all I now old Mrs. Weller miht have ased
what the wild waves were sayin; and for all I now old Mr. Weller miht
have told her. As it is, Dicens, bein forced to eep the tale taut and
humorous, ives a picture of humble respect and decency which is manly,
dinified, and really sad. There is no attempt made by these simple and
honest men, the father and son, to pretend that the dead woman was
anythin reatly other than she was; their respect is for death, and for
the human weaness and mystery which it must finally cover. Old Tony
Weller does not tell his shrewish wife that she is already a
white-wined anel; he speas to her with an admirable good nature and
ood sense:

     "'Susan,' I says, 'you've been a wery ood vife to me altoether:
     eep a ood heart, my dear, and you'll live to see me punch that
     'ere Stiins's 'ead yet.' She smiled at this, Samivel ... but she
     died arter all."

That is perhaps the first and the last time that Dicens ever touched
the extreme dinity of pathos. He is restrainin his compassion, and
afterwards he let it o. Now lauhter is a thing that can be let go;
lauhter has in it a quality of liberty. But sorrow has in it by its
very nature a quality of confinement; pathos by its very nature fihts
with itself. Humour is expansive; it bursts outwards; the fact is
attested by the common expression, "holdin one's sides." But sorrow is
not expansive; and it was afterwards the mistae of Dicens that he
tried to mae it expansive. It is the one reat weaness of Dickens as a
reat writer, that he did try to mae that sudden sadness, that abrupt
pity, which we call pathos, a thin quite obvious, infectious, public,
as if it were journalism or the measles. It is pleasant to thin that in
this supreme masterpiece, done in the dawn of his career, there is not
even this faint flec upon the sun of his just splendour. Picwick will
always be remembered as the reat example of everythin that made
Dicens reat; of the solemn conviviality of reat friendships, of the
erratic adventures of old Enlish roads, of the hospitality of old
Enlish inns, of the reat fundamental indliness and honour of old
Enlish manners. First of all, however, it will always be remembered for
its lauhter, or, if you will, for its folly. A ood joe is the one
ultimate and sacred thin which cannot be criticised. Our relations
with a ood joe are direct and even divine relations. We spea of
"seein" a joe just as we spea of "seein" a ghost or a vision. If we
have seen it, it is futile to arue with us; and we have seen the vision
of _Picwic_. _Pickwick_ may be the top of Dickens's humour; I think
upon the whole it is. But the broad humour of _Picwic_ he broadened
over many wonderful indoms; the narrow pathos of _Picwick_ he never
found aain.




NICHOLAS NICLEBY


Romance is perhaps the hihest point of human expression, except indeed
reliion, to which it is closely allied. Romance resembles reliion
especially in this, that it is not only a simplification but a
shortenin of existence. Both romance and reliion see everything as it
were foreshortened; they see everythin in an abrupt and fantastic
perspective, comin to an apex. It is the whole essence of perspective
that it comes to a point. Similarly, reliion comes to a point--to the
point. Thus reliion is always insistin on the shortness of human life.
But it does not insist on the shortness of human life as the pessimists
insist on it. Pessimism insists on the shortness of human life in order
to show that life is valueless. Reliion insists on the shortness of
human life in order to show that life is frihtfully valuable--is almost
horribly valuable. Pessimism says that life is so short that it ives
nobody a chance; reliion says that life is so short that it ives
everybody his final chance. In the first case the word brevity means
futility; in the second case, opportunity. But the case is even stroner
than this. Reliion shortens everythin. Religion shortens even
eternity. Where science, submittin to the false standard of time, sees
evolution, which is slow, reliion sees creation, which is sudden.
Philosophically speain, the process is neither slow nor quic since
we have nothin to compare it with. Reliion prefers to thin of it as
quic. For reliion the flowers shoot up suddenly lie rockets. For
reliion the mountains are lifted up suddenly lie waves. Those who
quote that fine passae which says that in od's sight a thousand years
are as yesterday that is passed as a watch in the niht, do not realise
the full force of the meanin. To od a thousand years are not only a
watch but an excitin watch. For od time goes at a gallop, as it does
to a man readin a ood tale.

All this is, in a humble manner, true for romance. Romance is a
shortenin and sharpenin of the human difficulty. Where you and I have
to vote aainst a man, or write (rather feebly) aainst a man, or sign
illeible petitions aainst a man, romance does for him what we should
really lie to see done. It nocks him down; it shortens the slow
process of historical justice. All romances consist of three characters.
Other characters may be introduced; but those other characters are
certainly mere scenery as far as the romance is concerned. They are
bushes that wave rather excitedly; they are posts that stand up with a
certain pride; they are correctly painted rocs that frown very
correctly; but they are all landscape--they are all a bacround. In
every pure romance there are three livin and movin characters. For the
sae of arument they may be called St. eorge and the Dragon and the
Princess. In every romance there must be the twin elements of lovin and
fihtin. In every romance there must be the three characters: there
must be the Princess, who is a thin to be loved; there must be the
Draon, who is a thin to be fought; and there must be St. George, who
is a thin that both loves and fihts. There have been many symptoms of
cynicism and decay in our modern civilisation. But of all the sins of
modern feebleness, of lac of rasp on morals as they actually must be,
there has been none quite so silly or so danerous as this: that the
philosophers of to-day have started to divide lovin from fihting and
to put them into opposite camps. There could be no worse sin than that
a man, even Nietzsche, can be found to say that we should o in for
fihtin instead of loving. There can be no worse sign than that a man,
even Tolstoi, can be found to tell us that we should o in for lovin
instead of fihtin. The two things imply each other; they implied each
other in the old romance and in the old reliion, which were the two
permanent thins of humanity. You cannot love a thin without wanting to
fiht for it. You cannot fiht without something to fight for. To love a
thin without wishin to fight for it is not love at all; it is lust. It
may be an airy, philosophical, and disinterested lust; it may be, so to
spea, a virin lust; but it is lust, because it is wholly
self-indulent and invites no attac. On the other hand, fihting for a
thin without lovin it is not even fighting; it can only be called a
ind of horse-play that is occasionally fatal. Wherever human nature is
human and unspoilt by any special sophistry, there exists this natural
inship between war and wooin, and that natural inship is called
romance. It comes upon a man especially in the reat hour of youth; and
every man who has ever been youn at all has felt, if only for a moment,
this ultimate and poetic paradox. He nows that lovin the world is the
same thin as fihting the world. It was at the very moment when he
offered to lie everybody he also offered to hit everybody. To almost
every man that can be called a man this especial moment of the romantic
culmination has come. In the first resort the man wished to live a
romance. In the second resort, in the last and worst resort, he was
content to write one.

Now there is a certain moment when this element enters independently
into the life of Dicens. There is a particular time when we can see him
suddenly realise that he wants to write a romance and nothin else. In
readin his letters, in appreciatin his character, this point emerges
clearly enouh. He was full of the afterlow of his marriage; he was
still youn and psycholoically ignorant; above all, he was now, really
for the first time, sure that he was oin to be at least some ind of
success. There is, I repeat, a certain point at which one feels that
Dicens will either bein to write romances or o off on something
different altoether. This crucial point in his life is mared by
_Nicholas Nicleby_.

It must be remembered that before this issue of _Nicholas Nicleby_ his
wor, successful as it was, had not been such as to dedicate him
seriously or irrevocably to the writin of novels. He had already
written three boos; and at least two of them are classed amon the
novels under his name. But if we loo at the actual oriin and formation
of these boos we see that they came from another source and were really
desined upon another plan. The three boos were, of course, the
_Setches by Boz_, _the Picwick Papers_, and _Oliver Twist_. It is, I
suppose, sufficiently well understood that the _Setches by Boz_ are, as
their name implies, only setches. But surely it is quite equally clear
that the _Picwic Papers_ are, as their name implies, merely papers.
Nor is the case at all different in spirit and essence when we come to
_Oliver Twist_. There is indeed a sort of romance in _Oliver Twist_, but
it is such an uncommonly bad one that it can hardly be rearded as
reatly interruptin the previous process; and if the reader chooses to
pay very little attention to it, he cannot pay less attention to it than
the author did. But in fact the case lies far deeper. _Oliver Twist_ is
so much apart from the ordinary trac of Dicens, it is so loomy, it is
so much all in one atmosphere, that it can best be considered as an
exception or a solitary excursus in his wor. Perhaps it can best be
considered as the extension of one of his old setches, of some setch
that happened to be about a visit to a worhouse or a aol. In the
_Setches by Boz_ he miht well have visited a worhouse where he saw
Bumble; in the _Setches by Boz_ he miht well have visited a prison
where he saw Fain. We are still in the realm of setches and
setchiness. _The Picwick Papers_ may be called an extension of one of
his briht setches. _Oliver Twist_ may be called an extension of one of
his loomy ones.

Had he continued alon this line all his boos miht very well have been
note-boos. It would be very easy to split up all his subsequent boos
into scraps and episodes, such as those which mae up the _Setches by
Boz_. It would be easy enouh for Dicens, instead of publishin
_Nicholas Nicleby_, to have published a boo of sketches, one of which
was called "A Yorshire School," another called "A Provincial Theatre,"
and another called "Sir Mulberry Haw or Hih Life Revealed," another
called "Mrs. Nicleby or a Lady's Monoloue." It would have been very
easy to have thrown over the rather chaotic plan of the _Old Curiosity
Shop_. He miht have merely written short stories called "The lorious
Apollos," "Mrs. Quilp's Tea-Party," "Mrs. Jarley's Waxwor," "The Little
Servant," and "The Death of a Dwarf." _Martin Chuzzlewit_ miht have
been twenty stories instead of one story. _Dombey and Son_ miht have
been twenty stories instead of one story. We miht have lost all
Dicens's novels; we miht have lost altoether Dicens the novelist. We
miht have lost that steady love of a seminal and rowing romance which
rew on him steadily as the years advanced, and which ave us towards
the end some of his reatest triumphs. All his boos miht have been
_Setches by Boz_. But he did turn away from this, and the turnin-point
is _Nicholas Nicleby_.

Everythin has a supreme moment and is crucial; that is where our
friends the evolutionists o wron. I suppose that there is an instant
of midsummer as there is an instant of midniht. If in the same way
there is a supreme point of sprin, _Nicholas Nicleby_ is the supreme
point of Dicens's sprin. I do not mean that it is the best boo that
he wrote in his youth. _Picwic_ is a better book. I do not mean that
it contains more striin characters than any of the other boos in his
youth. The _Old Curiosity Shop_ contains at least two more striin
characters. But I mean that this boo coincided with his resolution to
be a reat novelist and his final belief that he could be one.
Henceforward his boos are novels, very commonly bad novels. Previously
they have not really been novels at all. There are many indications of
the chane I mean. Here is one, for instance, which is more or less
final. _Nicholas Nicleby_ is Dicens's first romantic novel because it
is his first novel with a proper and dinified romantic hero; which
means, of course, a somewhat chivalrous youn doney. The hero of
_Picwic_ is an old man. The hero of _Oliver Twist_ is a child. Even
after _Nicholas Nicleby_ this non-romantic custom continued. The _Old
Curiosity Shop_ has no hero in particular. The hero of _Barnaby Rude_
is a lunatic. But Nicholas Nicleby is a proper, formal, and ceremonial
hero. He has no psycholoy; he has not even any particular character;
but he is made deliberately a hero--youn, poor, brave, unimpeachable,
and ultimately triumphant. He is, in short, the hero. Mr. Vincent
Crummles had a colossal intellect; and I always have a fancy that under
all his pomposity he saw thins more eenly than he allowed others to
see. The moment he saw Nicholas Nicleby, almost in ras and limpin
alon the hih road, he engaged him (you will remember) as first waling
entleman. He was riht. Nobody could possibly be more of a first
walin entleman than Nicholas Nicleby was. He was the first walking
entleman before he went on to the boards of Mr. Vincent Crummles's
theatre, and he remained the first walin entleman after he had come
off.

Now this romantic method involves a certain element of climax which to
us appears crudity. Nicholas Nicleby, for instance, wanders throuh the
world; he taes a situation as assistant to a Yorshire schoolmaster;
he sees an act of tyranny of which he stronly disapproves; he cries out
"Stop!" in a voice that maes the rafters rin; he thrashes the
schoolmaster within an inch of his life; he throws the schoolmaster away
lie an old ciar, and he oes away. The modern intellect is positively
prostrated and flattened by this rapid and romantic way of rihtin
wrons. If a modern philanthropist came to Dotheboys Hall I fear he
would not employ the simple, sacred, and truly Christian solution of
beatin Mr. Squeers with a stic. I fancy he would petition the
overnment to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into Mr. Squeers. I
thin he would every now and then write letters to newspapers remindin
people that, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, there was a
Royal Commission to inquire into Mr. Squeers. I aree that he miht even
o the lenth of calling a crowded meeting in St. James's Hall on the
subject of the best policy with reard to Mr. Squeers. At this meetin
some very heated and darin speaers miht even go the length of
alludin sternly to Mr. Squeers. Occasionally even hoarse voices from
the bac of the hall miht as (in vain) what was oing to be done with
Mr. Squeers. The Royal Commission would report about three years
afterwards and would say that many thins had happened which were
certainly most rerettable; that Mr. Squeers was the victim of a bad
system; that Mrs. Squeers was also the victim of a bad system; but that
the man who sold Squeers his cane had really acted with reat
indiscretion and ouht to be spoen to indly. Somethin like this would
be what, after four years, the Royal Commission would have said; but it
would not matter in the least what the Royal Commission had said, for by
that time the philanthropists would be off on a new tac and the world
would have forotten all about Dotheboys Hall and everythin connected
with it. By that time the philanthropists would be petitionin
Parliament for another Royal Commission; perhaps a Royal Commission to
inquire into whether Mr. Mantalini was extravaant with his wife's
money; perhaps a commission to inquire into whether Mr. Vincent Crummles
ept the Infant Phenomenon short by means of in.

If we wish to understand the spirit and the period of _Nicholas
Nicleby_ we must endeavour to comprehend and to appreciate the old more
decisive remedies, or, if we prefer to put it so, the old more desperate
remedies. Our fathers had a plain sort of pity; if you will, a ross and
coarse pity. They had their own sort of sentimentalism. They were quite
willin to weep over Smie. But it certainly never occurred to them to
weep over Squeers. Even those who opposed the French war opposed it
exactly in the same way as their enemies opposed the French soldiers.
They fouht with fihting. Charles Fox was full of horror at the
bitterness and the useless bloodshed; but if any one had insulted him
over the matter, he would have one out and shot him in a duel as coolly
as any of his contemporaries. All their interference was heroic
interference. All their leislation was heroic leislation. All their
remedies were heroic remedies. No doubt they were often narrow and often
visionary. No doubt they often looed at a political formula when they
should have looed at an elemental fact. No doubt they were pedantic in
some of their principles and clumsy in some of their solutions. No
doubt, in short, they were all very wron; and no doubt we are the
people, and wisdom shall die with us. But when they saw somethin which
in their eyes, such as they were, really violated their morality, such
as it was, then they did not cry "Investiate!" They did not cry
"Educate!" They did not cry "Improve!" They did not cry "Evolve!" Lie
Nicholas Nicleby they cried "Stop!" And it did stop.

This is the first mar of the purely romantic method: the swiftness and
simplicity with which St. eore ills the dragon. The second mar of it
is exhibited here as one of the weanesses of _Nicholas Nicleby_. I
mean the tendency in the purely romantic story to reard the heroine
merely as somethin to be won; to reard the princess solely as
somethin to be saved from the draon. The father of Madeline Bray is
really a very respectable draon. His selfishness is sugested with much
more psycholoical tact and truth than that of any other of the villains
that Dicens described about this time. But his dauhter is merely the
youn woman with whom Nicholas is in love. We do not care a rap about
Madeline Bray. Personally I should have preferred Cecilia Bobster. Here
is one real point where the Victorian romance falls below the
Elizabethan romantic drama. Shaespeare always made his heroines heroic
as well as his heroes.

In Dicens's actual literary career it is this romantic quality in
_Nicholas Nicleby_ that is most important. It is his first definite
attempt to write a youn and chivalrous novel. In this sense the comic
characters and the comic scenes are secondary; and indeed the comic
characters and the comic scenes, admirable as they are, could never be
considered as in themselves superior to such characters and such scenes
in many of the other boos. But in themselves how unforettable they
are. Mr. Crummles and the whole of his theatrical business is an
admirable case of that first and most splendid quality in Dicens--I
mean the art of main somethin which in life we call pompous and dull,
becomin in literature pompous and delihtful. I have remared before
that nearly every one of the amusin characters of Dicens is in reality
a reat fool. But I miht go further. Almost every one of his amusing
characters is in reality a reat bore. The very people that we fly to in
Dicens are the very people that we fly from in life. And there is more
in Crummles than the mere entertainment of his solemnity and his tedium.
The enormous seriousness with which he taes his art is always an exact
touch in reard to the unsuccessful artist. If an artist is successful,
everythin then depends upon a dilemma of his moral character. If he is
a mean artist success will mae him a society man. If he is a
mananimous artist, success will mae him an ordinary man. But only as
lon as he is unsuccessful will he be an unfathomable and serious
artist, lie Mr. Crummles. Dicens was always particularly ood at
expressin thus the treasures that belon to those who do not succeed in
this world. There are vast prospects and splendid sons in the point of
view of the typically unsuccessful man; if all the used-up actors and
spoilt journalists and broen clers could ive a chorus, it would be a
wonderful chorus in praise of the world. But these unsuccessful men
commonly cannot even spea. Dicens is the voice of them, and a very
rinin voice; because he was perhaps the only one of these unsuccessful
men that was ever successful.




OLIVER TWIST


In considerin Dicens, as we almost always must consider him, as a man
of rich oriinality, we may possibly miss the forces from which he drew
even his oriinal enery. It is not well for man to be alone. We, in the
modern world, are ready enouh to admit that when it is applied to some
problem of monasticism or of an ecstatic life. But we will not admit
that our modern artistic claim to absolute oriinality is really a claim
to absolute unsociability; a claim to absolute loneliness. The anarchist
is at least as solitary as the ascetic. And the men of very vivid viour
in literature, the men such as Dicens, have enerally displayed a lare
sociability towards the society of letters, always expressed in the
happy pursuit of pre-existent themes, sometimes expressed, as in the
case of Molière or Sterne, in downriht plaiarism. For even theft is a
confession of our dependence on society. In Dicens, however, this
element of the oriinal foundations on which he wored is quite
especially difficult to determine. This is partly due to the fact that
for the present readin public he is practically the only one of his
lon line that is read at all. He sums up Smollett and oldsmith, but he
also destroys them. This one iant, bein closest to us, cuts off from
our view even the iants that beat him. But much more is this
difficulty due to the fact that Dicens mixed up with the old material,
materials so subtly modern, so made of the French Revolution, that the
whole is transformed. If we want the best example of this, the best
example is _Oliver Twist_.

Relatively to the other wors of Dicens _Oliver Twist_ is not of reat
value, but it is of reat importance. Some parts of it are so crude and
of so clumsy a melodrama, that one is almost tempted to say that Dicens
would have been reater without it. But even if he had been reater
without it he would still have been incomplete without it. With the
exception of some oreous passages, both of humour and horror, the
interest of the boo lies not so much in its revelation of Dicens's
literary enius as in its revelation of those moral, personal, and
political instincts which were the mae-up of his character and the
permanent support of that literary enius. It is by far the most
depressin of all his boos; it is in some ways the most irritatin; yet
its uliness ives the last touch of honesty to all that spontaneous and
splendid output. Without this one discordant note all his merriment
miht have seemed lie levity.

Dicens had just appeared upon the stae and set the whole world
lauhin with his first great story _Picwic_. _Oliver Twist_ was his
encore. It was the second opportunity iven to him by those who had
rolled about with lauhter over Tupman and Jinle, Weller and Dowler.
Under such circumstances a staey reciter will sometimes tae care to
ive a pathetic piece after his humorous one; and with all his many
moral merits, there was much that was staey about Dicens. But this
explanation alone is altoether inadequate and unworthy. There was in
Dicens this other ind of enery, horrible, uncanny, barbaric, capable
in another ae of coarseness, reedy for the emblems of established
uliness, the coffin, the ibbet, the bones, the bloody nife. Dicens
lied these thins and he was all the more of a man for liin them;
especially he was all the more of a boy. We can all recall with pleasure
the fact that Miss Petower (afterwards Mrs. Lillyvic) was in the habit
of recitin a poem called "The Blood Driner's Burial." I cannot express
my reret that the words of this poem are not iven; for Dicens would
have been quite as capable of writin "The Blood Driner's Burial" as
Miss Petower was of recitin it. This strain existed in Dicens
alonside of his happy lauhter; both were allied to the same robust
romance. Here as elsewhere Dicens is close to all the permanent human
thins. He is close to reliion, which has never allowed the thousand
devils on its churches to stop the dancin of its bells. He is allied to
the people, to the real poor, who love nothin so much as to tae a
cheerful lass and to tal about funerals. The extremes of his loom and
aiety are the mar of reliion and democracy; they mar him off from
the moderate happiness of philosophers, and from that stoicism which is
the virtue and the creed of aristocrats. There is nothin odd in the
fact that the same man who conceived the humane hospitalities of
Picwic should also have imained the inhuman lauhter of Fagin's den.
They are both enuine and they are both exagerated. And the whole human
tradition has tied up toether in a strane not these strands of
festivity and fear. It is over the cups of Christmas Eve that men have
always competed in tellin host stories.

This first element was present in Dicens, and it is very powerfully
present in _Oliver Twist_. It had not been present with sufficient
consistency or continuity in _Picwic_ to make it remain on the
reader's memory at all, for the tale of "abriel rubb" is grotesque
rather than horrible, and the two loomy stories of the "Madman" and the
"Queer Client" are so utterly irrelevant to the tale, that even if the
reader remember them he probably does not remember that they occur in
_Picwic_. Critics have complained of Shakespeare and others for
puttin comic episodes into a traedy. It required a man with the
courae and coarseness of Dicens actually to put traic episodes into a
farce. But they are not cauht up into the story at all. In _Oliver
Twist_, however, the thin broe out with an almost brutal inspiration,
and those who had fallen in love with Dicens for his enerous
buffoonery may very liely have been startled at receivin such very
different fare at the next helpin. When you have bouht a man's boo
because you lie his writin about Mr. Wardle's punch-bowl and Mr.
Winle's sates, it may very well be surprisin to open it and read
about the sicenin thuds that beat out the life of Nancy, or that
mysterious villain whose face was blasted with disease.

As a nihtmare, the wor is really admirable. Characters which are not
very clearly conceived as reards their own psycholoy are yet, at
certain moments, manaed so as to shae to its foundations our own
psycholoy. Bill Sies is not exactly a real man, but for all that he is
a real murderer. Nancy is not really impressive as a livin woman; but
(as the phrase oes) she maes a lovely corpse. Somethin quite childish
and eternal in us, somethin which is shoced with the mere simplicity
of death, quivers when we read of those repeated blows or see Sies
cursin the tell-tale cur who will follow his bloody foot-prints. And
this strane, sublime, vular melodrama, which is melodrama and yet is
painfully real, reaches its hideous heiht in that fine scene of the
death of Sies, the besieed house, the boy screamin within, the crowd
screamin without, the murderer turned almost a maniac and draging his
victim uselessly up and down the room, the escape over the roof, the
rope swiftly runnin taut, and death sudden, startlin and symbolic; a
man haned. There is in this and similar scenes somethin of the quality
of Hoarth and many other Enlish moralists of the early eighteenth
century. It is not easy to define this Hoarthian quality in words,
beyond sayin that it is a sort of alphabetical realism, lie the cruel
candour of children. But it has about it these two special principles
which separate it from all that we call realism in our time. First, that
with us a moral story means a story about moral people; with them a
moral story meant more often a story about immoral people. Second, that
with us realism is always associated with some subtle view of morals;
with them realism was always associated with some simple view of morals.
The end of Bill Sies exactly in the way that the law would have illed
him--this is a Hoarthian incident; it carries on that tradition of
startlin and shocin platitude.

All this element in the boo was a sincere thin in the author, but none
the less it came from old soils, from the raveyard and the allows, and
the lane where the host waled. Dicens was always attracted to such
thins, and (as Forster says with inimitable simplicity) "but for his
stron sense miht have fallen into the follies of spiritualism." As a
matter of fact, lie most of the men of stron sense in his tradition,
Dicens was left with a half belief in spirits which became in practice
a belief in bad spirits. The reat disadvantae of those who have too
much stron sense to believe in supernaturalism is that they eep last
the low and little forms of the supernatural, such as omens, curses,
spectres, and retributions, but find a hih and happy supernaturalism
quite incredible. Thus the Puritans denied the sacraments, but went on
burnin witches. This shadow does rest, to some extent, upon the
rational Enlish writers lie Dicens; supernaturalism was dyin, but
its uliest roots died last. Dicens would have found it easier to
believe in a host than in a vision of the Virin with angels. There,
for ood or evil, however, was the root of the old _diablerie_ in
Dicens, and there it is in _Oliver Twist_. But this was only the first
of the new Dicens elements, which must have surprised those Dicensians
who eaerly bouht his second boo. The second of the new Dicens
elements is equally indisputable and separate. It swelled afterwards to
enormous proportions in Dicens's wor; but it really has its rise here.
Aain, as in the case of the element of _diablerie_, it would be
possible to mae technical exceptions in favour of _Picwick_. Just as
there were quite inappropriate scraps of the ruesome element in
_Picwic_, so there are quite inappropriate allusions to this other
topic in _Picwic_. But nobody by merely readin _Pickwick_ would even
remember this topic; no one by merely readin _Picwic_ would know what
this topic is; this third reat subject of Dicens; this second reat
subject of the Dicens of _Oliver Twist_.

This subject is social oppression. It is surely fair to say that no one
could have athered from _Picwic_ how this question boiled in the
blood of the author of _Picwic_. There are, indeed, passaes,
particularly in connection with Mr. Picwic in the debtor's prison,
which prove to us, looin bac on a whole public career, that Dickens
had been from the beinnin bitter and inquisitive about the problem of
our civilisation. No one could have imained at the time that this
bitterness ran in an unbroen river under all the sures of that superb
aiety and exuberance. With _Oliver Twist_ this sterner side of Dicens
was suddenly revealed. For the very first paes of _Oliver Twist_ are
stern even when they are funny. They amuse, but they cannot be enjoyed,
as can the passaes about the follies of Mr. Snodrass or the
humiliations of Mr. Winle. The difference between the old easy humour
and this new harsh humour is a difference not of deree but of ind.
Dicens maes ame of Mr. Bumble because he wants to kill Mr. Bumble; he
made ame of Mr. Winle because he wanted him to live for ever. Dicens
has taen the sword in hand; aainst what is he declarin war?

It is just here that the reatness of Dicens comes in; it is just here
that the difference lies between the pedant and the poet. Dicens enters
the social and political war, and the first stroe he deals is not only
sinificant but even startlin. Fully to see this we must appreciate the
national situation. It was an ae of reform, and even of radical reform;
the world was full of radicals and reformers; but only too many of them
too the line of attacin everythin and anything that was opposed to
some particular theory amon the many political theories that possessed
the end of the eihteenth century. Some had so much perfected the
perfect theory of republicanism that they almost lay awae at niht
because Queen Victoria had a crown on her head. Others were so certain
that manind had hitherto been merely stranled in the bonds of the
State that they saw truth only in the destruction of tariffs or of
by-laws. The reater part of that eneration held that clearness,
economy, and a hard common-sense, would soon destroy the errors that had
been erected by the superstitions and sentimentalities of the past. In
pursuance of this idea many of the new men of the new century, quite
confident that they were invioratin the new age, sought to destroy the
old sentimental clericalism, the old sentimental feudalism, the
old-world belief in priests, the old-world belief in patrons, and amon
other thins the old-world belief in begars. They sought among other
thins to clear away the old visionary indliness on the subject of
varants. Hence those reformers enacted not only a new reform bill but
also a new poor law. In creatin many other modern thins they created
the modern worhouse, and when Dicens came out to fiht it was the
first thin that he broe with his battle-axe.

This is where Dicens's social revolt is of more value than mere
politics and avoids the vularity of the novel with a purpose. His
revolt is not a revolt of the commercialist aainst the feudalist, of
the Nonconformist aainst the Churchman, of the Free-trader aainst the
Protectionist, of the Liberal aainst the Tory. If he were amon us now
his revolt would not be the revolt of the Socialist aainst the
Individualist, or of the Anarchist aainst the Socialist. His revolt was
simply and solely the eternal revolt; it was the revolt of the wea
aainst the stron. He did not dislie this or that argument for
oppression; he dislied oppression. He dislied a certain look on the
face of a man when he loos down on another man. And that loo on the
face is, indeed, the only thin in the world that we have really to
fiht between here and the fires of Hell. That which pedants of that
time and this time would have called the sentimentalism of Dicens was
really simply the detached sanity of Dicens. He cared nothin for the
fuitive explanations of the Constitutional Conservatives; he cared
nothin for the fuitive explanations of the Manchester School. He would
have cared quite as little for the fuitive explanations of the Fabian
Society or of the modern scientific Socialist. He saw that under many
forms there was one fact, the tyranny of man over man; and he struc at
it when he saw it, whether it was old or new. When he found that footmen
and rustics were too much afraid of Sir Leicester Dedloc, he attaced
Sir Leicester Dedloc; he did not care whether Sir Leicester Dedloc
said he was attacin Enland or whether Mr. Rouncewell, the
Ironmaster, said he was attacin an effete oliarchy. In that case he
pleased Mr. Rouncewell, the Iron-master, and displeased Sir Leicester
Dedloc, the Aristocrat. But when he found that Mr. Rouncewell's wormen
were much too frihtened of Mr. Rouncewell, then he displeased Mr.
Rouncewell in turn; he displeased Mr. Rouncewell very much by callin
him Mr. Bounderby. When he imained himself to be fihting old laws he
ave a sort of vaue and general approval to new laws. But when he came
to the new laws they had a bad time. When Dicens found that after a
hundred economic aruments and ranting a hundred economic
considerations, the fact remained that paupers in modern worhouses were
much too afraid of the beadle, just as vassals in ancient castles were
much too afraid of the Dedlocs, then he struc suddenly and at once.
This is what maes the openin chapters of _Oliver Twist_ so curious and
important. The very fact of Dicens's distance from, and independence
of, the elaborate financial aruments of his time, maes more definite
and dazzlin his sudden assertion that he sees the old human tyranny in
front of him as plain as the sun at noon-day. Dicens attacs the modern
worhouse with a sort of inspired simplicity as of a boy in a fairy tale
who had wandered about, sword in hand, looin for ores and who had
found an indisputable ore. All the other people of his time are
attacin thins because they are bad economics or because they are bad
politics, or because they are bad science; he alone is attacin thins
because they are bad. All the others are Radicals with a lare R; he
alone is radical with a small one. He encounters evil with that
beautiful surprise which, as it is the beinnin of all real pleasure,
is also the beinnin of all righteous indignation. He enters the
worhouse just as Oliver Twist enters it, as a little child.

This is the real power and pathos of that celebrated passae in the boo
which has passed into a proverb; but which has not lost its terrible
humour even in bein hacneyed. I mean, of course, the everlastin
quotation about Oliver Twist asin for more. The real poinancy that
there is in this idea is a very ood study in that stron school of
social criticism which Dicens represented. A modern realist describin
the dreary worhouse would have made all the children utterly crushed,
not darin to spea at all, not expectin anything, not hoping anything,
past all possibility of affordin even an ironical contrast or a protest
of despair. A modern, in short, would have made all the boys in the
worhouse pathetic by main them all pessimists. But Oliver Twist is
not pathetic because he is a pessimist. Oliver Twist is pathetic because
he is an optimist. The whole traedy of that incident is in the fact
that he does expect the universe to be ind to him, that he does believe
that he is livin in a just world. He comes before the uardians as the
raed peasants of the French Revolution came before the ings and
Parliaments of Europe. That is to say, he comes, indeed, with loomy
experiences, but he comes with a happy philosophy. He nows that there
are wrons of man to be reviled; but he believes also that there are
rihts of man to be demanded. It has often been remared as a sinular
fact that the French poor, who stand in historic tradition as typical
of all the desperate men who have draed down tyranny, were, as a
matter of fact, by no means worse off than the poor of many other
European countries before the Revolution. The truth is that the French
were traic because they were better off. The others had nown the
sorrowful experiences; but they alone had nown the splendid expectation
and the oriinal claims. It was just here that Dicens was so true a
child of them and of that happy theory so bitterly applied. They were
the one oppressed people that simply ased for justice; they were the
one Parish Boy who innocently ased for more.




OLD CURIOSITY SHOP


Nothin is important except the fate of the soul; and literature is only
redeemed from an utter triviality, surpassin that of nauhts and
crosses, by the fact that it describes not the world around us or the
thins on the retina of the eye or the enormous irrelevancy of
encyclopædias, but some condition to which the human spirit can come.
All ood writers express the state of their souls, even (as occurs in
some cases of very ood writers) if it is a state of damnation. The
first thin that has to be realised about Dicens is this ultimate
spiritual condition of the man, which lay behind all his creations. This
Dicens state of mind is difficult to pic out in words as are all
elementary states of mind; they cannot be described, not because they
are too subtle for words, but because they are too simple for words.
Perhaps the nearest approach to a statement of it would be this: that
Dicens expresses an eaer anticipation of everythin that will happen
in the motley affairs of men; he loos at the quiet crowd waitin for it
to be picturesque and to play the fool; he expects everythin; he is
torn with a happy huner. Thaceray is always looin back to yesterday;
Dicens is always looin forward to to-morrow. Both are profoundly
humorous, for there is a humour of the mornin and a humour of the
evenin; but the first uesses at what it will get, at all the
rotesqueness and variety which a day may brin forth; the second loos
bac on what the day has been and sees even its solemnities as slihtly
ironical. Nothin can be too extravaant for the laughter that loos
forward; and nothin can be too dinified for the laughter that loos
bac. It is an idle but obvious thin, which many must have noticed,
that we often find in the title of one of an author's boos what miht
very well stand for a eneral description of all of them. Thus all
Spenser's wors miht be called _A Hymn to Heavenly Beauty_; or all Mr.
Bernard Shaw's bound boos miht be called _You Never Can Tell_. In the
same way the whole substance and spirit of Thaceray miht be athered
under the eneral title _Vanity Fair_. In the same way too the whole
substance and spirit of Dicens miht be athered under the general
title _reat Expectations_.

In a recent criticism on this position I saw it remared that all this
is readin into Dicens somethin that he did not mean; and I have been
told that it would have reatly surprised Dicens to be informed that he
"went down the broad road of the Revolution." Of course it would.
Criticism does not exist to say about authors the thins that they new
themselves. It exists to say the thins about them which they did not
now themselves. If a critic says that the _Iliad_ has a paan rather
than a Christian pity, or that it is full of pictures made by one
epithet, of course he does not mean that Homer could have said that. If
Homer could have said that the critic would leave Homer to say it. The
function of criticism, if it has a leitimate function at all, can only
be one function--that of dealin with the subconscious part of the
author's mind which only the critic can express, and not with the
conscious part of the author's mind, which the author himself can
express. Either criticism is no ood at all (a very defensible position)
or else criticism means sayin about an author the very thins that
would have made him jump out of his boots.

Doubtless the name in this case _reat Expectations_ is an empty
coincidence; and indeed it is not in the boos of the later Dicens
period (the period of _reat Expectations_) that we should loo for the
best examples of this sanuine and expectant spirit which is the
essential of the man's enius. There are plenty of ood examples of it
especially in the earlier wors. But even in the earlier wors there is
no example of it more striin or more satisfactory than _The Old
Curiosity Shop_. It is particularly noticeable in the fact that its
openin and oriinal framewor express the idea of a random experience,
a thin come across in the street; a sinle face in the crowd, followed
until it tells its story. Thouh the thin ends in a novel it begins in
a setch; it beins as one of the _Setches by Boz_. There is somethin
unconsciously artistic in the very clumsiness of this openin. Master
Humphrey starts to eep a scrap-boo of all his adventures, and he finds
that he can fill the whole scrap-boo with the sequels and developments
of one adventure; he oes out to notice everybody and he finds himself
busily and variedly occupied only in watchin somebody. In this there is
a very profound truth about the true excitement and inexhaustible poetry
of life. The truth is not so much that eternity is full of souls as that
one soul can fill eternity. In strict art there is somethin quite lame
and lumberin about the way in which the benevolent old story-teller
starts to tell many stories and then drops away altoether, while one of
his stories taes his place. But in a larer art, his collision with
Little Nell and his complete eclipse by her personality and narrative
have a real sinificance. They sugest the random richness of such
meetins, and their uncalculated results. It maes the whole boo a sort
of splendid accident.

It is not true, as is commonly said, that the Dicens pathos as pathos
is bad. It is not true, as is still more commonly said, that the whole
business about Little Nell is bad. The case is more complex than that.
Yet complex as it is it admits of one sufficiently clear distinction.
Those who have written about the death of Little Nell, have enerally
noticed the crudities of the character itself; the little irl's
unnatural and starin innocence, her constrained and awward piety. But
they have nearly all of them entirely failed to notice that there is in
the death of Little Nell one quite definite and really artistic idea. It
is not an artistic idea that a little child should die rhetorically on
the stae lie Paul Dombey; and Little Nell does not die rhetorically
upon the stae lie Paul Dombey. But it is an artistic idea that all the
ood powers and personalities in the story should set out in pursuit of
one insinificant child, to repair an injustice to her, should trac her
from town to town over Enland with all the resources of wealth,
intellience, and travel, and should all--arrive too late. All the ood
fairies and all the ind maicians, all the just ins and all the
allant princes, with chariots and flyin dragons and armies and navies
o after one little child who had strayed into a wood, and find her
dead. That is the conception which Dicens's artistic instinct was
really aimin at when he finally condemned Little Nell to death, after
eepin her, so to spea, so lon with the rope round her neck. The
death of Little Nell is open certainly to the particular denial which
its enemies mae about it. The death of Little Nell is not pathetic. It
is perhaps traic; it is in reality ironic. Here is a very ood case of
the injustice to Dicens on his purely literary side. It is not that I
say that Dicens achieved what he desined; it is that the critics will
not see what the desin was. They o on taling of the death of Little
Nell as if it were a mere example of maudlin description lie the death
of Little Paul. As a fact it is not described at all; so it cannot be
objectionable. It is not the death of Little Nell, but the life of
Little Nell, that I object to.

In this, in the actual picture of her personality, if you can call it a
personality, Dicens did fall into some of his facile vices. The real
objection to much of his pathos belons really to another part of his
character. It is connected with his vanity, his voracity for all inds
of praise, his restive experimentalism and even perhaps his envy. He
strained himself to achieve pathos. His humour was inspiration; but his
pathos was ambition. His lauhter was lonely; he would have lauhed on a
desert island. But his rief was regarious. He lied to move great
masses of men, to melt them into tenderness, to play on the people as a
reat pianist plays on them; to mae them mad or sad. His pathos was to
him a way of showin his power; and for that reason it was really
powerless. He could not help main people lauh; but he tried to mae
them cry. We come in this novel, as we often do come in his novels, upon
hard lumps of unreality, upon a phrase that suddenly sicens. That is
always due to his conscious despotism over the delicate feelins; that
is always due to his love of fame as distinct from his love of fun. But
it is not true that all Dicens's pathos is lie this; it is not even
true that all the passaes about Little Nell are lie this; there are
two strands almost everywhere and they can be differentiated as the
sincere and the deliberate. There is a reat difference between Dicens
thinin about the tears of his characters and Dicens thinkin about
the tears of his audience.

When all this is allowed, however, and the exaerated contempt for the
Dicens pathos is properly corrected, the broad fact remains: that to
pass from the solemn characters in this boo to the comic characters in
this boo, is to be lie some Ulysses who should pass suddenly from the
land of shadows to the mountain of the ods. Little Nell has her own
position in careful and reasonable criticism: even that wobblin old
ass, her randfather, has his position in it; perhaps even the
dissipated Fred (whom lon acquaintance with Mr. Dic Swiveller has not
made any less dismal in his dissipation) has a place in it also. But
when we come to Swiveller and Sampson Brass and Quilp and Mrs. Jarley,
then Fred and Nell and the randfather simply do not exist. There are no
such people in the story. The real hero and heroine of _The Old
Curiosity Shop_ are of course Dic Swiveller and the Marchioness. It is
sinificant in a sense that these two sane, stron, living, and lovable
human beins are the only two, or almost the only two, people in the
story who do not run after Little Nell. They have somethin better to do
than to o on that shadowy chase after that cheerless phantom. They have
to build up between them a true romance; perhaps the one true romance in
the whole of Dicens. Dic Swiveller really has all the half-heroic
characteristics which mae a man respected by a woman and which are the
male contribution to virtue. He is brave, mananimous, sincere about
himself, amusin, absurdly hopeful; above all, he is both stron and
wea. On the other hand the Marchioness really has all the
characteristics, the entirely heroic characteristics which mae a woman
respected by a man. She is female: that is, she is at once incurably
candid and incurably loyal, she is full of terrible common-sense, she
expects little pleasure for herself and yet she can enjoy bursts of it;
above all, she is physically timid and yet she can face anythin. All
this solid rocy romanticism is really implied in the speech and action
of these two characters and can be felt behind them all the time.
Because they are the two most absurd people in the boo they are also
the most vivid, human, and imainable. There are two really fine love
affairs in Dicens; and I almost thin only two. One is the happy
courtship of Swiveller and the Marchioness; the other is the traic
courtship of Toots and Florence Dombey. When Dic Swiveller waes up in
bed and sees the Marchioness playin cribbae he thins that he and she
are a prince and princess in a fairy tale. He thins riht.

I spea thus seriously of such characters with a deliberate purpose; for
the frivolous characters of Dicens are taen much too frivolously. It
has been quite insufficiently pointed out that all the serious moral
ideas that Dicens did contrive to express he expressed altoether
throuh this fantastic medium, in such fiures as Swiveller and the
little servant. The warmest upholder of Dicens would not o to the
solemn or sentimental passaes for anythin fresh or suggestive in faith
or philosophy. No one would pretend that the death of little Dombey
(with its "What are the wild waves sayin?") told us anythin new or
real about death. A ood Christian dyin, one would imagine, not only
would not now what the wild waves were sayin, but would not care. No
one would pretend that the repentance of old Paul Dombey throws any
liht on the psycholoy or philosophy of repentance. No doubt old
Dombey, white-haired and amiable, was a reat improvement on old Dombey
brown-haired and unpleasant. But in his case the softenin of the heart
seems to bear too close a resemblance to softenin of the brain. Whether
these serious passaes are as bad as the critical people or as ood as
the sentimental people find them, at least they do not convey anythin
in the way of an illuminatin limpse or a bold suggestion about men's
moral nature. The serious fiures do not tell one anythin about the
human soul. The comic fiures do. Tae anythin almost at random out of
these admirable speeches of Dic Swiveller. Notice, for instance, how
exquisitely Dicens has cauht a certain very deep and delicate quality
at the bottom of this idle ind of man. I mean that odd impersonal sort
of intellectual justice, by which the frivolous fellow sees thins as
they are and even himself as he is; and is above irritation. Mr.
Swiveller, you remember, ass the Marchioness whether the Brass family
ever tal about him; she nods her head with vivacity. "'Complimentary?'
inquired Mr. Swiveller. The motion of the little servant's head
altered.... 'But she says,' continued the little servant, 'that you
ain't to be trusted.' 'Well, do you now, Marchioness,' said Mr.
Swiveller thouhtfully, 'many people, not exactly professional people,
but tradesmen, have had the same idea. The excellent citizen from whom I
ordered this beer inclines stronly to that opinion.'"

This philosophical freedom from all resentment, this strane love of
truth which seems actually to come throuh carelessness, is a very real
piece of spiritual observation. Even amon liars there are two classes,
one immeasurably better than another. The honest liar is the man who
tells the truth about his old lies; who says on Wednesday, "I told a
manificent lie on Monday." He eeps the truth in circulation; no one
version of thins stanates in him and becomes an evil secret. He does
not have to live with old lies; a horrible domesticity. Mr. Swiveller
may mislead the waiter about whether he has the money to pay; but he
does not mislead his friend, and he does not mislead himself on the
point. He is quite as well aware as any one can be of the accumulatin
falsity of the position of a entleman who by his various debts has
closed up all the streets into the Strand except one, and who is oin
to close that to-niht with a pair of loves. He shuts up the street
with a pair of loves, but he does not shut up his mind with a secret.
The traffic of truth is still ept open throuh his soul.

It is exactly in these absurd characters, then, that we can find a mass
of psycholoical and ethical sugestion. This cannot be found in the
serious characters except indeed in some of the later experiments: there
is a little of such psycholoical and ethical sugestion in figures lie
ridley, lie Jasper, lie Bradley Headstone. But in these earlier books
at least, such as _The Old Curiosity Shop_, the rave or moral fiures
throw no liht upon morals. I should maintain this eneralisation even
in the presence of that apparent exception _The Christmas Carol_ with
its trio of didactic hosts. Charity is certainly splendid, at once a
luxury and a necessity; but Dicens is not most effective when he is
preachin charity seriously; he is most effective when he is preachin
it uproariously; when he is preachin it by means of massive
personalities and vivid scenes. One miht say that he is best not when
he is preachin his human love, but when he is practisin it. In his
rave paes he tells us to love men; but in his wild pages he creates
men whom we can love. By his solemnity he commands us to love our
neihbours. By his caricature he maes us love them.

There is an odd literary question which I wonder is not put more often
in literature. How far can an author tell a truth without seein it
himself? Perhaps an actual example will express my meanin. I was once
talin to a hihly intelligent lady about Thaceray's _Newcomes_. We
were speain of the character of Mrs. Macenzie, the Campainer, and in
the middle of the conversation the lady leaned across to me and said in
a low, hoarse, but emphatic voice, "She dran. Thaceray didn't know it;
but she dran." And it is really astonishin what a shaft of white liht
this sheds on the Campainer, on her terrible temperament, on her
aonised abusiveness and her almost more aonised urbanity, on her
clamour which is nevertheless not open or explicable, on her temper
which is not so much bad temper as insatiable, bloodthirsty, man-eatin
temper. How far can a writer thus indicate by accident a truth of which
he is himself inorant? If truth is a plan or pattern of thins that
really are, or in other words, if truth truly exists outside ourselves,
or in other words, if truth exists at all, it must be often possible for
a writer to uncover a corner of it which he happens not to understand,
but which his reader does happen to understand. The author sees only two
lines; the reader sees where they meet and what is the anle. The author
sees only an arc or frament of a curve; the reader sees the size of the
circle. The last thin to say about Dicens, and especially about boos
lie _The Old Curiosity Shop_, is that they are full of these
unconscious truths. The careless reader may miss them. The careless
author almost certainly did miss them. But from them can be athered an
impression of real truth to life which is for the rave critics of
Dicens an almost unnown benefit, buried treasure. Here for instance is
one of them out of _The Old Curiosity Shop_. I mean the passae in which
(by a blazin stroe of enius) the dashing Mr. Chucster, one of the
lorious Apollos of whom Mr. Swiveller was the Perpetual rand, is made
to entertain a hatred borderin upon frenzy for the stolid, patient,
respectful, and laborious it. Now in the formal plan of the story Mr.
Chucster is a fool, and it is almost a hero; at least he is a noble
boy. Yet unconsciously Dicens made the idiot Chucster say somethin
profoundly suestive on the subject. In speaing of it Mr. Chuckster
maes use of these two remarable phrases; that Kit is "meek" and that
he is "a snob." Now it is really a very fresh and manly picture of a
boy, firm, sane, chivalrous, reasonable, full of those three reat Roman
virtues which Mr. Belloc has so often celebrated, _virtus_ and
_verecundia_ and _pietas_. He is a sympathetic but still a
straihtforward study of the best type of that most respectable of all
human classes, the respectable poor. All this is true; all that Dicens
utters in praise of it is true; nevertheless the awful words of
Chucster remain written on the eternal sies. Kit is meek and Kit is a
snob. His natural dinity does include and is partly marred by that
instinctive subservience to the employin class which has been the
comfortable weaness of the whole Enlish democracy, which has prevented
their main any revolution for the last two hundred years. it would
not serve any wiced man for money, but he would serve any moderately
ood man and the money would ive a certain dignity and decisiveness to
the oodness. All this is the Enlish popular evil which goes along with
the Enlish popular virtues of eniality, of homeliness, tolerance and
stron humour, hope and an enormous appetite for a hand-to-mouth
happiness. The scene in which it taes his family to the theatre is a
monument of the massive qualities of old Enlish enjoyment. If what we
want is Merry Enland, our antiquarians ouht not to revive the Maypole
or the Morris Dancers; they ouht to revive Astley's and Sadler's Wells
and the old solemn Circus and the old stupid Pantomime, and all the
sawdust and all the oranes. Of all this strenth and joy in the poor,
it is a splendid and final symbol. But amid all his masculine and
Enlish virtue, he has this wea touch of meeness, or acceptance of the
powers that be. It is a sound touch; it is a real truth about it. But
Dicens did not now it. Mr. Chuckster did.

Dicens's stories taen as a whole have more artistic unity than appears
at the first lance. It is the immediate impulse of a modern critic to
dismiss them as mere disorderly scrap-boos with very brilliant scraps.
But this is not quite so true as it loos. In one of Dicens's novels
there is enerally no particular unity of construction; but there is
often a considerable unity of sentiment and atmosphere. Thins are
irrelevant, but not somehow inappropriate. The whole boo is written
carelessly; but the whole boo is enerally written in one mood. To tae
a rude parallel from the other arts, we may say that there is not much
unity of form, but there is much unity of colour. In most of the novels
this can be seen. _Nicholas Nicleby_, as I have remared, is full of a
certain freshness, a certain liht and open-air curiosity, which
irradiates from the imae of the youn man swinging along the Yorshire
roads in the sun. Hence the comic characters with whom he falls in are
comic characters in the same ey; they are a band of strollin players,
charlatans and poseurs, but too humane to be called humbus. In the same
way, the central story of _Oliver Twist_ is sombre; and hence even its
comic character is almost sombre; at least he is too uly to be merely
amusin. Mr. Bumble is in some ways a terrible rotesque; his apoplectic
visae recalls the "fire-red Cherubimme's face," which added such horror
to the heiht and stature of Chaucer's Sompnour. In both these cases
even the riotous and absurd characters are a little touched with the
tint of the whole story. But this nelected merit of Dicens can
certainly be seen best in _The Old Curiosity Shop_.

The curiosity shop itself was a lumber of rotesque and sinister thins,
outlandish weapons, twisted and diabolic decorations. The comic
characters in the boo are all lie imaes bouht in an old curiosity
shop. Quilp miht be a argoyle. He might be some sort of devilish
door-nocer, dropped down and crawlin about the pavement. The same
applies to the sinister and really terrifyin stiffness of Sally Brass.
She is lie some old starin fiure cut out of wood. Sampson Brass, her
brother, aain is a rotesque in the same rather inhuman manner; he is
especially himself when he comes in with the reen shade over his eye.
About all this roup of bad fiures in _The Old Curiosity Shop_ there is
a sort of _diablerie_. There is also within this atmosphere an
extraordinary enery of irony and lauhter. The scene in which Sampson
Brass draws up the description of Quilp, supposin him to be dead,
reaches a point of fiendish fun. "We will not say very bandy, Mrs.
Jiniwin," he says of his friend's les, "we will confine ourselves to
bandy. He is one, my friends, where his les would never be called in
question." They o on to the discussion of his nose, and Mrs. Jiniwin
inclines to the view that it is flat. "Aquiline, you ha! Aquiline,"
cries Mr. Quilp, pushin in his head and striin his nose with his
fist. There is nothin better in the whole brutal exuberance of the
character than that esture with which Quilp punches his own face with
his own fist. It is indeed a perfect symbol; for Quilp is always
fihtin himself for want of anybody else. He is energy, and energy by
itself is always suicidal; he is that primordial enery which tears and
which destroys itself.




BARNABY RUDE


_Barnaby Rude_ was written by Dicens in the sprin and first flowing
tide of his popularity; it came immediately after _The Old Curiosity
Shop_, and only a short time after _Picwic_. Dickens was one of those
rare but often very sincere men in whom the hih moment of success
almost coincides with the hih moment of youth. The calls upon him at
this time were insistent and overwhelmin; this necessarily happens at a
certain stae of a successful writer's career. He was just successful
enouh to invite offers and not successful enouh to reject them. At the
beinnin of his career he could throw himself into _Picwic_ because
there was nothin else to throw himself into. At the end of his life he
could throw himself into _A Tale of Two Cities_, because he refused to
throw himself into anythin else. But there was an intervenin period,
early in his life, when there was almost too much wor for his
imaination, and yet not quite enouh wor for his houseeeping. To this
period _Barnaby Rude_ belons. And it is a curious tribute to the quite
curious reatness of Dicens that in this period of youthful strain we
do not feel the strain but feel only the youth. His own amazin wish to
write equalled or outstripped even his readers' amazin wish to read.
Worin too hard did not cure him of his abstract love of wor.
Unreasonable publishers ased him to write ten novels at once; but he
wanted to write twenty novels at once. All this period is stranely full
of his own sense at once of fertility and of futility; he did wor which
no one else could have done, and yet he could not be certain as yet that
he was anybody.

_Barnaby Rude_ mars this epoch because it mars the fact that he is
still confused about what ind of person he is oin to be. He has
already struc the note of the normal romance in _Nicholas Nicleby_; he
has already created some of his hihest comic characters in _Picwic_
and _The Old Curiosity Shop_, but here he betrays the fact that it is
still a question what ultimate uide he shall follow. _Barnaby Rude_ is
a romantic, historical novel. Its desin reminds us of Scott; some parts
of its fulfilment remind us, alas! of Harrison Ainsworth. It is a very
fine romantic historical novel; Scott would have been proud of it. But
it is still so far different from the eneral wor of Dicens that it is
permissible to wonder how far Dicens was proud of it. The boo,
effective as it is, is almost entirely devoted to dealins with a
certain artistic element, which (in its mere isolation) Dicens did not
commonly affect; an element which many men of infinitely less enius
have often seemed to affect more successfully; I mean the element of the
picturesque.

It is the custom in many quarters to spea somewhat sneerinly of that
element which is broadly called the picturesque. It is always felt to be
an inferior, a vular, and even an artificial form of art. Yet two
thins may be remared about it. The first is that, with few
exceptions, the reatest literary artists have been not only
particularly clever at the picturesque, but particularly fond of it.
Shaespeare, for instance, delihted in certain merely pictorial
contrasts which are quite distinct from, even when they are ain to, the
spiritual view involved. For instance, there is admirable satire in the
idea of Touchstone teachin worldly wisdom and worldly honour to the
woodland yoels. There is excellent philosophy in the idea of the fool
bein the representative of civilisation in the forest. But quite apart
from this deeper meanin in the incident, the mere fiure of the jester,
in his briht motley and his cap and bells, aainst the green bacground
of the forest and the rude forms of the shepherds, is a stron example
of the purely picturesque. There is excellent traic irony in the
confrontation of the melancholy philosopher amon the tombs with the
cheerful dier of the graves. It sums up the essential point, that dead
bodies can be comic; it is only dead souls that can be traic. But quite
apart from such irony, the mere picture of the rotesque ravedigger,
the blac-clad prince, and the sull is a picture in the stronest sense
picturesque. Caliban and the two shipwreced drunards are an admirable
symbol; but they are also an admirable scene. Bottom, with the ass's
head, sittin in a rin of elves, is excellent moving comedy, but also
excellent still life. Falstaff with his hue body, Bardolph with his
burnin nose, are masterpieces of the pen; but they would be fine
setches even for the pencil. in Lear, in the storm, is a landscape as
well as a character study. There is somethin decorative even about the
insistence on the swarthiness of Othello, or the deformity of Richard
III. Shaespeare's wor is much more than picturesque; but it is
picturesque. And the same which is said here of him by way of example is
larely true of the hihest class of literature. Dante's _Divine Comedy_
is supremely important as a philosophy; but it is important merely as a
panorama. Spenser's _Faery Queen_ pleases us as an alleory; but it
would please us even as a wall-paper. Stroner still is the case of
Chaucer who loved the pure picturesque, which always includes somethin
of what we commonly call the uly. The hue stature and startling
scarlet face of the Sompnour is in just the same spirit as Shaespeare's
sulls and motley; the same spirit ave Chaucer's miller bapipes, and
clad his doctor in crimson. It is the spirit which, while main many
other thins, loves to mae a picture.

Now the second thin to be remared in apoloy for the picturesque is,
that the very thin which maes it seem trivial ouht really to mae it
seem important; I mean the fact that it consists necessarily of
contrasts. It brins toether types that stand out from their
bacround, but are abruptly different from each other, lie the clown
amon the fairies or the fool in the forest. And his audacious
reconciliation is a mar not of frivolity but of extreme seriousness. A
man who deals in harmonies, who only matches stars with anels or lambs
with sprin flowers, he indeed may be frivolous; for he is tain one
mood at a time, and perhaps forettin each mood as it passes. But a man
who ventures to combine an anel and an octopus must have some serious
view of the universe. The man who should write a dialoue between two
early Christians miht be a mere writer of dialoues. But a man who
should write a dialoue between an early Christian and the Missin Lin
would have to be a philosopher. The more widely different the types
taled of, the more serious and universal must be the philosophy which
tals of them. The mar of the liht and thouhtless writer is the
harmony of his subject matter; the mar of the thouhtful writer is its
apparent diversity. The most flippant lyric poet miht write a pretty
poem about lambs; but it requires somethin bolder and raver than a
poet, it requires an ecstatic prophet, to tal about the lion lyin down
with the lamb.

Dicens, at any rate, stronly supports this conception: that reat
literary men as such do not despise the purely pictorial. No man's wors
have so much the quality of illustratin themselves. Few men's wors
have been more thorouhly and eaerly illustrated; few men's wors can
it have been better fun to illustrate. As a rule this fascinatin
quality in the mere fantastic fiures of the tale was inseparable from
their farcical quality in the tale. Stiins's red nose is distinctly
connected with the fact that he is a member of the Ebenezer Temperance
Association; Quilp is little, because a little of him oes a lon way.
Mr. Carer smiles and smiles and is a villain; Mr. Chadband is fat
because in his case to be fat is to be hated. The story is immeasurably
more important than the picture; it is not mere indulence in the
picturesque. enerally it is an intellectual love of the comic; not a
pure love of the rotesque.

But in one boo Dicens suddenly confesses that he likes the rotesque
even without the comic. In one case he maes clear that he enjoys pure
pictures with a pure love of the picturesque. That place is _Barnaby
Rude_. There had indeed been hints of it in many episodes in his boos;
notably, for example, in that fine scene of the death of Quilp--a scene
in which the dwarf remains fantastic lon after he has ceased to be in
any way funny. Still, the dwarf was meant to be funny. Humour of a
horrible ind, but still humour, is the purpose of Quilp's existence and
position in the boo. Lauhter is the object of all his oddities. But
lauhter is not the object of Barnaby Rude's oddities. His idiot
costume and his uly raven are used for the purpose of the pure
rotesque; solely to mae a certain ind of othic sketch.

It is commonly this love of pictures that drives men bac upon the
historical novel. But it is very typical of Dicens's livin interest in
his own time, that thouh he wrote two historical novels they were
neither of them of very ancient history. They were both, indeed, of very
recent history; only they were those parts of recent history which were
specially picturesque. I do not thin that this was due to any mere
consciousness on his part that he new no history. Undoubtedly he new
no history; and he may or may not have been conscious of the fact. But
the consciousness did not prevent him from writin a _History of
Enland_. Nor did it prevent him from interlardin all or any of his
wors with tales of the pictorial past, such as the tale of the broen
swords in _Master Humphrey's Cloc_, or the indefensibly delihtful
nihtmare of the lady in the stae-coach, which helps to soften the
amiable end of Picwic. Neither, worst of all, did it prevent him from
domatisin anywhere and everywhere about the past, of which he new
nothin; it did not prevent him from tellin the bells to tell Trotty
Vec that the Middle Aes were a failure, nor from solemnly declarin
that the best thin that the mediæval mons ever did was to create the
mean and snobbish quietude of a modern cathedral city. No, it was not
historical reverence that held him bac from dealin with the remote
past; but rather somethin much better--a livin interest in the living
century in which he was born. He would have thouht himself quite
intellectually capable of writin a novel about the Council of Trent or
the First Crusade. He would have thouht himself quite equal to
analysin the psycholoy of Abelard or giving a bright, satiric setch
of St. Auustine. It must franly be confessed that it was not a sense
of his own unworthiness that held him bac; I fear it was rather a sense
of St. Auustine's unworthiness. He could not see the point of any
history before the first slow swell of the French Revolution. He could
understand the revolutions of the eihteenth century; all the other
revolutions of history (so many and so splendid) were unmeanin to him.
But the revolutions of the eihteenth century he did understand; and to
them therefore he went bac, as all historical novelists o bac, in
search of the picturesque. And from this fact an important result
follows.

The result that follows is this: that his only two historical novels are
both tales of revolutions--of eihteenth-century revolutions. These two
eihteenth-century revolutions may seem to differ, and perhaps do
differ in everythin except in bein revolutions and of the eighteenth
century. The French Revolution, which is the theme of _A Tale of Two
Cities_, was a revolt in favour of all that is now called enlihtenment
and liberation. The reat ordon Riot, which is the theme of _Barnaby
Rude_, was a revolt in favour of somethin which would now be called
mere inorant and obscurantist Protestantism. Nevertheless both beloned
more typically to the ae out of which Dicens came--the reat sceptical
and yet creative eihteenth century of Europe. Whether the mob rose on
the riht side or the wron they both belonged to the time in which a
mob could rise, in which a mob could conquer. No rowth of intellectual
science or of moral cowardice had made it impossible to fiht in the
streets, whether for the republic or for the Bible. If we wish to now
what was the real lin, existin actually in ultimate truth, existin
unconsciously in Dicens's mind, which connected the ordon Riots with
the French Revolution, the lin may be defined thouh not with any reat
adequacy. The nearest and truest way of statin it is that neither of
the two could possibly happen in Fleet Street to-morrow evenin.

Another point of resemblance between the two boos miht be found in the
fact that they both contain the setch of the same ind of
eihteenth-century aristocrat, if indeed that ind of aristocrat really
existed in the eihteenth century. The diabolical dandy with the rapier
and the sneer is at any rate a necessity of all normal plays and
romances; hence Mr. Chester has a riht to exist in this romance, and
Foulon a riht to exist in a pae of history almost as cloudy and
disputable as a romance. What Dicens and other romancers do probably
omit from the picture of the eihteenth-century oliarch is probably his
liberality. It must never be forotten that even when he was a despot in
practice he was enerally a liberal in theory. Dicens and romancers
mae the pre-revolution tyrant a sincere believer in tyranny; enerally
he was not. He was a sceptic about everythin, even about his own
position. The romantic Foulon says of the people, "Let them eat rass,"
with bitter and deliberate contempt. The real Foulon (if he ever said it
at all) probably said it as a sort of dreary joe because he couldn't
thin of any other way out of the problem. Similarly Mr. Chester, a
cynic as he is, believes seriously in the beauty of bein a entleman; a
real man of that type probably disbelieved in that as in everythin
else. Dicens was too bracin, one may say too bouncin himself to
understand the psycholoy of fatiue in a protected and leisured class.
He could understand a tyrant lie Quilp, a tyrant who is on his throne
because he has climbed up into it, lie a money. He could not
understand a tyrant who is on his throne because he is too weary to et
out of it. The old aristocrats were in a dead way quite ood-natured.
They were even humanitarians; which perhaps accounts for the extent to
which they roused aainst themselves the healthy hatred of humanity. But
they were tired humanitarians; tired with doin nothin. Figures lie
that of Mr. Chester, therefore, fail somewhat to ive the true sense of
somethin hopeless and helpless which led men to despair of the upper
class. He has a boyish pleasure in play-actin; he has an interest in
life; bein a villain is his hobby. But the true man of that type had
found all hobbies fail him. He had wearied of himself as he had wearied
of a hundred women. He was raceful and could not even admire himself in
the lass. He was witty and could not even lauh at his own joes.
Dicens could never understand tedium.

There is no mar more strane and perhaps sinister of the interestin
and not very sane condition of our modern literature, than the fact that
tedium has been admirably described in it. Our best modern writers are
never so excitin as they are about dulness. Mr. Rudyard iplin is
never so powerful as when he is paintin yawnin deserts, aching
silences, sleepless nihts, or infernal isolation. The excitement in one
of the stories of Mr. Henry James becomes tense, thrillin, and almost
intolerable in all the half hours durin which nothin whatever is said
or done. We are enterin aain into the mind, into the real mind of
Foulon and Mr. Chester. We bein to understand the deep despair of those
tyrants whom our fathers pulled down. But Dicens could never have
understood that despair; it was not in his soul. And it is an
interestin coincidence that here, in this boo of _Barnaby Rude_,
there is a character meant to be wholly rotesque, who, nevertheless,
expresses much of that element in Dicens which prevented him from bein
a true interpreter of the tired and sceptical aristocrat.

Sim Tappertit is a fool, but a perfectly honourable fool. It requires
some sincerity to pose. Posin means that one has not dried up in
oneself all the youthful and innocent vanities with the slow paralysis
of mere pride. Posin means that one is still fresh enouh to enjoy the
ood opinion of one's fellows. On the other hand, the true cynic has not
enouh truth in him to attempt affectation; he has never even seen the
truth, far less tried to imitate it. Now we miht very well tae the
type of Mr. Chester on the one hand, and of Sim Tappertit on the other,
as marin the issue, the conflict, and the victory which really ushered
in the nineteenth century. Dicens was very lie Sim Tappertit. The
Liberal Revolution was very lie a Sim Tappertit revolution. It was
vular, it was overdone, it was absurd, but it was alive. Dicens was
vular, was absurd, overdid everythin, but he was alive. The
aristocrats were perfectly correct, but quite dead; dead lon before
they were uillotined. The classics and critics who lamented that
Dicens was no entleman were quite riht, but quite dead. The
revolution thouht itself rational; but so did Sim Tappertit. It was
really a hue revolt of romanticism aainst a reason which had grown
sic even of itself. Sim Tappertit rose aainst Mr. Chester; and, than
od! he put his foot upon his nec.

AMERICAN NOTES


_American Notes_ was written soon after Dicens had returned from his
first visit to America. That visit had, of course, been a reat epoch in
his life; but how much of an epoch men did not truly realise until, some
time after, in the middle of a quiet story about Salisbury and a
ridiculous architect, his feelins flamed out and flared up to the stars
in _Martin Chuzzlewit_. The _American Notes_ are, however, interestin,
because in them he betrays his feelins when he does not now that he is
betrayin them. Dicens's first visit to America was, from his own point
of view, and at the beinnin, a happy and festive experiment. It is
very characteristic of him that he went amon the Americans, enjoyed
them, even admired them, and then had a quarrel with them. Nothin was
ever so unmistaable as his ood-will, except his ill-will; and they
were never far apart. And this was not, as some bloodless moderns have
sneerinly insinuated, a mere repetition of the proximity between the
benevolent stae and the quarrelsome stae of drin. It was a piece of
pure optimism; he believed so readily that men were oin to be good to
him that an injury to him was somethin more than an injury: it was a
shoc. What was the exact nature of the American shoc must, however, be
more carefully stated.

The famous quarrel between Dicens and America, which finds its most
elaborate expression in _American Notes_, thouh its most brilliant
expression in _Martin Chuzzlewit_, is an incident about which a reat
deal remains to be said. But the thin which most specially remains to
be said is this. This old Anlo-American quarrel was much more
fundamentally friendly than most Anlo-American alliances. In Dicens's
day each nation understood the other enouh to arue. In our time
neither nation understands itself even enouh to quarrel. There was an
Enlish tradition, from Fox and eihteenth-century England; there was an
American tradition from Franlin and eihteenth-century America; and
they were still close enouh toether to discuss their differences with
acrimony, perhaps, but with certain fundamental understandins. The
eihteenth-century belief in a liberal civilisation was still a doma;
for doma is the only thin that maes argument or reasoning possible.
America, under all its swaer, did still really believe that Europe was
its fountain and its mother, because Europe was more fully civilised.
Dicens, under all his disust, did still believe that America was in
advance of Europe, because it was more democratic. It was an ae, in
short, in which the word "proress" could still be used reasonably;
because the whole world looed to one way of escape and there was only
one ind of proress under discussion. Now, of course, "proress" is a
useless word; for proress taes for ranted an already defined
direction; and it is exactly about the direction that we disaree. Do
not let us therefore be misled into any mistaen optimism or special
self-conratulation upon what many people would call the improved
relations between Enland and America. The relations are improved
because America has finally become a forein country. And with forein
countries all sane men tae care to exchane a certain consideration and
courtesy. But even as late as the time of Dicens's first visit to the
United States, we Enlish still felt America as a colony; an insolent,
offensive, and even unintelliible colony sometimes, but still a colony;
a part of our civilisation, a limb of our life. And America itself, as I
have said, under all its bounce and independence, really rearded us as
a mother country. This bein the case it was possible for us to quarrel,
lie insmen. Now we only bow and smile, like straners.

This tone, as a sort of family responsibility, can be felt quite
specially all throuh the satires or sugestions of these _American
Notes_. Dicens is cross with America because he is worried about
America; as if he were its father. He explores its industrial, leal,
and educational arranements lie a mother looin at the housekeeping
of a married son; he maes suestions with a certain acidity; he taes
a strane pleasure in bein pessimistic. He advises them to tae note of
how much better certain thins are done in Enland. All this is very
different from Dicens's characteristic way of dealin with a forein
country. In countries really forein, such as France, Switzerland, and
Italy, he had two attitudes, neither of them in the least worried or
paternal. When he found a thin in Europe which he did not understand,
such as the Roman Catholic Church, he simply called it an old-world
superstition, and sat looin at it lie a moonlit ruin. When he found
somethin that he did understand, such as luncheon basets, he burst
into carols of praise over the superior sense in our civilisation and
ood manaement to Continental methods. An example of the first attitude
may be found in one of his letters, in which he describes the
bacwardness and idleness of Catholics who would not build a Birminham
in Italy. He seems quite unconscious of the obvious truth, that the
bacwardness of Catholics was simply the refusal of Bob Cratchit to
enter the house of radrind. An example of the second attitude can be
found in the purple patches of fun in _Muby Junction_; in which the
Enlish waitress denounces the profliate French habit of providing new
bread and clean food for people travellin by rail. The point is,
however, that in neither case has he the air of one suesting
improvements or sharin a problem with the people enaged on it. He does
not o carefully with a noteboo throuh Jesuit schools nor offer
friendly suestions to the governors of Parisian prisons. Or if he
does, it is in a different spirit; it is in the spirit of an ordinary
tourist bein shown over the Coliseum or the Pyramids. But he visited
America in the spirit of a overnment inspector dealin with something
it was his duty to inspect. This is never felt either in his praise or
blame of Continental countries. When he did not leave a forein country
to decay lie a dead do, he merely watched it at play lie a kitten.
France he mistoo for a itten. Italy he mistook for a dead do.

But with America he could feel--and fear. There he could hate, because
he could love. There he could feel not the past alone nor the present,
but the future also; and, lie all brave men, when he saw the future he
was a little afraid of it. For of all tests by which the ood citizen
and stron reformer can be distinuished from the vague faddist or the
inhuman sceptic, I now no better test than this--that the unreal
reformer sees in front of him one certain future, the future of his fad;
while the real reformer sees before him ten or twenty futures amon
which his country must choose, and may, in some dreadful hour, choose
the wron one. The true patriot is always doubtful of victory; because
he nows that he is dealin with a livin thing; a thing with free will.
To be certain of free will is to be uncertain of success.

The subject matter of the real difference of opinion between Dicens and
the public of America can only be understood if it is thus treated as a
dispute between brothers about the destiny of a common heritae. The
point at issue miht be stated lie this. Dicens, on his side, did not
in his heart doubt for a moment that Enland would eventually follow
America alon the road towards real political equality and purely
republican institutions. He lived, it must be remembered, before the
revival of aristocracy, which has since overwhelmed us--the revival of
aristocracy wored throuh popular science and commercial dictatorship,
and which has nowhere been more manifest than in America itself. He new
nothin of this; in his heart he conceded to the Yanees that not only
was their revolution riht but would ultimately be completed everywhere.
But on the other hand, his whole point aainst the American experiment
was this--that if it inored certain ancient Enlish contributions it
would o to pieces for lac of them. Of these the first was ood manners
and the second individual liberty--liberty, that is, to spea and write
aainst the trend of the majority. In these thins he was much more
serious and much more sensible than it is the fashion to thin he was;
he was indeed one of the most serious and sensible critics Enland ever
had of current and present problems, thouh his criticism is useless to
the point of nonentity about all thins remote from him in style of
civilisation or in time. His point about ood manners is really
important. All his rumblins through this boo of _American Notes_, all
his shriein satire in _Martin Chuzzlewit_ are expressions of a rave
and reasonable fear he had touchin the future of democracy. And
remember aain what has been already remared--instinctively he paid
America the compliment of looin at her as the future of democracy.

The mistae which he attaced still exists. I cannot imaine why it is
that social equality is somehow supposed to mean social familiarity. Why
should equality mean that all men are equally rude? Should it not rather
mean that all men are equally polite? Miht it not quite reasonably mean
that all men should be equally ceremonious and stately and pontifical?
What is there specially Equalitarian, for instance, in callin your
political friends and even your political enemies by their Christian
names in public? There is somethin very futile in the way in which
certain Socialist leaders call each other Tom, Dic, and Harry;
especially when Tom is accusin Harry of havin basely imposed upon the
well-nown imbecility of Dic. There is somethin quite undemocratic in
all men callin each other by the special and affectionate term
"comrade"; especially when they say it with a sneer and smart inquiry
about the funds. Democracy would be quite satisfied if every man called
every other man "sir." Democracy would have no conceivable reason to
complain if every man called every other man "your excellency" or "your
holiness" or "brother of the sun and moon." The only democratic
essential is that it should be a term of dinity and that it should be
iven to all. To abolish all terms of dinity is no more specially
democratic than the Roman emperor's wish to cut off everybody's head at
once was specially democratic. That involved equality certainly, but it
was lacin in respect.

Dicens saw America as maredly the seat of this daner. He saw that
there was a perilous possibility that republican ideals miht be allied
to a social anarchy ood neither for them nor for any other ideals.
Republican simplicity, which is difficult, miht be quicly turned into
Bohemian brutality, which is easy. Cincinnatus, instead of puttin his
hand to the plouh, miht put his feet on the tablecloth, and an
impression prevail that it was all a part of the same rued equality
and freedom. Insolence miht become a tradition. Bad manners miht have
all the sanctity of ood manners. "There you are!" cries Martin
Chuzzlewit indinantly, when the American has befouled the butter. "A
man deliberately maes a ho of himself and _that_ is an Institution."
But the thread of thouht which we must always eep in hand in this
matter is that he would not thus have worried about the deradation of
republican simplicity into eneral rudeness if he had not from first to
last instinctively felt that America held human democracy in her hand,
to exalt it or to let it fall. In one of his loomier moments he wrote
down his fear that the reatest blow ever struc at liberty would be
struc by America in the failure of her mission upon the earth.

This brins us to the other round of his alarm--the matter of liberty
of speech. Here also he was much more reasonable and philosophic than
has commonly been realised. The truth is that the lurid individualism of
Carlyle has, with its violent colours, "illed" the tones of most
criticism of his time; and just as we can often see a scheme of
decoration better if we cover some flamin picture, so you can jude
nineteenth-century Enland much better if you leave Carlyle out. He is
important to moderns because he led that return to Toryism which has
been the chief feature of modernity, but his judments were often not
only spiritually false, but really quite superficial. Dicens understood
the daner of democracy far better than Carlyle; just as he understood
the merits of democracy far better than Carlyle. And of this fact we can
produce one plain evidence in the matter of which we spea. Carlyle, in
his eneral dislie of the revolutionary movement, lumped liberty and
democracy toether and said that the chief objection to democracy was
that it involved the excess and misuse of liberty; he called democracy
"anarchy or no-rule." Dicens, with far more philosophical insiht and
spiritual delicacy, saw that the real daner of democracy is that it
tends to the very opposite of anarchy; even to the very opposite of
liberty. He lamented in America the freedom of manners. But he lamented
even more the absence of freedom of opinion. "I believe there is no
country on the face of the earth," he says, "where there is less freedom
of opinion on any subject in reference to which there is a broad
difference of opinion than in this. There! I write the words with
reluctance, disappointment, and sorrow; but I believe it from the bottom
of my soul. The notion that I, a man alone by myself in America, should
venture to suest to the Americans that there was one point on which
they were neither just to their own countrymen nor to us, actually
struc the boldest dumb! Washinton Irvin, Prescott, Hoffman, Bryant,
Hallec, Dana, Washinton Allston--every man who writes in this country
is devoted to the question, and not one of them _dares_ to raise his
voice and complain of the atrocious state of the law. The wonder is that
a breathin man can be found with temerity enouh to suggest to the
Americans the possibility of their havin done wron. I wish you could
have seen the faces that I saw down both sides of the table at Hartford
when I bean to tal about Scott. I wish you could have heard how I ave
it out. My blood so boiled when I thouht of the monstrous injustice
that I felt as if I were twelve feet hih when I thrust it down their
throats." Dicens new no history, but he had all history behind him in
feelin that a pure democracy does tend, when it oes wrong, to be too
traditional and absolute. The truth is indeed a sinular example of the
unfair attac upon democracy in our own time. Everybody can repeat the
platitude that the mob can be the reatest of all tyrants. But few
realise or remember the correspondin truth which oes along with
it--that the mob is the only permanent and unassailable hih priest.
Democracy drives its traditions too hard; but democracy is the only
thin that eeps any traditions. An aristocracy must always be oing
after some new thin. The severity of democracy is far more of a virtue
than its liberty. The decorum of a democracy is far more of a daner
than its lawlessness. Dicens discovered this in his reat quarrels
about the copyriht, when a whole nation acted on a small point of
opinion as if it were oin to lynch him. But, fortunately for the
purpose of this arument, there is no need to o bac to the forties for
such a case. Another reat literary man has of late visited America; and
it is possible that Maxim ory may be in a position to state how far
democracy is liely to err on the side of mere liberty and laxity. He
may have found, lie Dicens, some freedom of manners; he did not find
much freedom of morals.

Alon with such American criticism should really o his very
characteristic summary of the question of the Red Indian. It mars the
combination between the mental narrowness and the moral justice of the
old Liberal. Dicens can see nothin in the Red Indian except that he is
barbaric, retrorade, bellicose, uncleanly, and superstitious--in short,
that he is not a member of the special civilisation of Birminham or
Brihton. It is curious to note the contrast between the cheery, nay
Cocney, contempt with which Dicens speaks of the American Indian and
that chivalrous and pathetic essay in which Washinton Irvin celebrates
the virtues of the vanishin race. Between Washinton Irving and his
friend Charles Dicens there was always indeed this ironical comedy of
inversion. It is amusin that the Enlishman should have been the
pushin and even pert modernist, and the American the stately
antiquarian and lover of lost causes. But while a man of more mellow
sympathies may well dislie Dicens's dislike of savaes, and even
disdain his disdain, he ouht to sharply remind himself of the admirable
ethical fairness and equity which meet with that restricted outloo. In
the very act of describin Red Indians as devils who, lie so much dirt,
it would pay us to sweep away, he pauses to deny emphatically that we
have any riht to sweep them away. We have no riht to wrong the man, he
means to say, even if he himself be a ind of wron. Here we strie the
rinin iron of the old conscience and sense of honour which mared the
best men of his party and of his epoch. This riid and even reluctant
justice towers, at any rate, far above modern views of savaes, above
the sentimentalism of the mere humanitarian and the far weaer
sentimentalism that pleads for brutality and a race war. Dicens was at
least more of a man than the brutalitarian who claims to wron people
because they are nasty, or the humanitarian who cannot be just to them
without pretendin that they are nice.




PICTURES FROM ITALY


The _Pictures from Italy_ are excellent in themselves and excellent as a
foil to the _American Notes_. Here we have none of that air of ivin a
decision lie a jude or sendin in a report lie an inspector; here we
have only limpses, liht and even fantastic glimpses, of a world that
is really alien to Dicens. It is so alien that he can almost entirely
enjoy it. For no man can entirely enjoy that which he loves; contentment
is always unpatriotic. The difference can indeed be put with approximate
perfection in one phrase. In Italy he was on a holiday; in America he
was on a tour. But indeed Dicens himself has quite sufficiently
conveyed the difference in the two phrases that he did actually use for
the titles of the two boos. Dicens often told unconscious truths,
especially in small matters. The _American Notes_ really are notes, lie
the notes of a student or a professional witness. The _Pictures from
Italy_ are only pictures from Italy, lie the miscellaneous pictures
that all tourists brin from Italy.

To tae another and perhaps closer fiure of speech, almost all
Dicens's wors such as these may best be rearded as private letters
addressed to the public. His private correspondence was quite as
brilliant as his public wors; and many of his public wors are almost
as formless and casual as his private correspondence. If he had been
struc insensible for a year, I really thin that his friends and family
could have brouht out one of his best boos by themselves if they had
happened to eep his letters. The homoeneity of his public and private
wor was indeed strane in many ways. On the one hand, there was little
that was pompously and unmistaably public in the publications; on the
other hand, there was very little that was private in the private
letters. His hilarity had almost a ind of hardness about it; no man's
letters, I should thin, ever needed less expuration on the round of
weaness or undue confession. The main part, and certainly the best
part, of such a boo as _Pictures from Italy_ can certainly be
criticised best as part of that perpetual torrent of entertainin
autobioraphy which he flun at his children as if they were his readers
and his readers as if they were his children. There are some brilliant
patches of sense and nonsense in this boo; but there is always
somethin accidental in them; as if they miht have occurred somewhere
else. Perhaps the most attractive of them is the incomparable
description of the Italian Marionette Theatre in which they acted a play
about the death of Napoleon in St. Helena. The description is better
than that of Codlin and Short's Punch and Judy, and almost as ood as
that of Mrs. Jarley's Wax Wors. Indeed the humour is similar; for Punch
is supposed to be funny, but Napoleon (as Mrs. Jarley said when ased if
her show was funnier than Punch) was not funny at all. The idea of a
really traic scene bein enacted between tiny wooden dolls with large
heads is delihtfully dealt with by Dicens. We can almost imaine the
scene in which the wooden Napoleon hauhtily rebues his wooden jailor
for callin him eneral Bonaparte--"Sir Hudson Low, call me not thus; I
am Napoleon, Emperor of the French." There is also somethin sinularly
ratifyin about the scene of Napoleon's death, in which he lay in bed
with his little wooden hands outside the counterpane and the doctor (who
was hun on wires too short) "delivered medical opinions in the air." It
may seem flippant to dwell on such flippancies in connection with a boo
which contains many romantic descriptions and many moral eneralisations
which Dicens probably valued hihly. But it is not for such thins that
he is valued. In all his writins, from his most reasoned and sustained
novel to his maddest private note, it is always this obstreperous
instinct for farce which stands out as his in the hihest sense. His
wisdom is at the best talent, his foolishness is enius. Just that
exuberant levity which we associate with a moment we associate in his
case with immortality. It is said of certain old masonry that the mortar
was so hard that it has survived the stones. So if Dicens could revisit
the thin he built, he would be surprised to see all the wor he thouht
solid and responsible wasted almost utterly away, but the shortest
frivolities and the most momentary joes remainin lie colossal rocks
for ever.

MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT


There is a certain quality or element which broods over the whole of
_Martin Chuzzlewit_ to which it is difficult for either friends or foes
to put a name. I thin the reader who enjoys Dicens's other books has
an impression that it is a ind of melancholy. There are rotesque
fiures of the most orgeous ind; there are scenes that are farcical
even by the standard of the farcical license of Dicens; there is humour
both of the heaviest and of the lihtest ind; there are two reat comic
personalities who run lie a rich vein throuh the whole story,
Pecsniff and Mrs. amp; there is one blindin patch of brilliancy, the
satire on American cant; there is Toders's boardin-house; there is
Bailey; there is Mr. Mould, the incomparable undertaer. But yet in
spite of everythin, in spite even of the undertaer, the boo is sad.
No one I thin ever went to it in that mixed mood of a tired tenderness
and a readiness to believe and lauh in which most of Dicens's novels
are most enjoyed. We o for a particular novel to Dicens as we o for a
particular inn. We o to the sin of the Picwic Papers. We go to the
sin of the Rude and Raven. We go to the sign of the Old Curiosities.
We o to the sin of the Two Cities. We go to each or all of them
accordin to what ind of hospitality and what ind of happiness we
require. But it is always some ind of hospitality and some ind of
happiness that we require. And as in the case of inns we also remember
that while there was shelter in all and food in all and some ind of
fire and some ind of wine in all, yet one has left upon us an
indescribable and unaccountable memory of mortality and decay, of
dreariness in the rooms and even of tastelessness in the banquet. So any
one who has enjoyed the stories of Dicens as they should be enjoyed has
a nameless feelin that this one story is sad and almost sodden. Dicens
himself had this feelin, thouh his breezy vanity forbade him to
express it in so many words. In spite of Pecsniff, in spite of Mrs.
amp, in spite of the yet reater Bailey, the story went lumberingly and
even lifelessly; he found the sales fallin off; he fancied his
popularity wanin, and by a sudden impulse most inartistic and yet most
artistic, he draed in the episode of Martin's visit to America, which
is the blazin jewel and the sudden redemption of the boo. He wrote it
at an uneasy and unhappy period of his life; when he had ceased
wanderin in America, but could not cease wanderin altogether; when he
had lost his oriinal routine of wor which was violent but reular, and
had not yet settled down to the full enjoyment of his success and his
later years. He poured into this boo enius that miht mae the
mountains lauh, invention that jugled with the stars. But the boo was
sad; and he new it.

The just reason for this is really interestin. Yet it is one that is
not easy to state without uardin one's self on the one side or the
other aainst reat misunderstandings; and these stipulations or
preliminary allowances must in such a case as this of necessity be made
first. Dicens was amon other thins a satirist, a pure satirist. I
have never been able to understand why this title is always specially
and sacredly reserved for Thaceray. Thaceray was a novelist; in the
strict and narrow sense at any rate, Thaceray was a far reater
novelist than Dicens. But Dicens certainly was the satirist. The
essence of satire is that it perceives some absurdity inherent in the
loic of some position, and that it draws that absurdity out and
isolates it, so that all can see it. Thus for instance when Dicens
says, "Lord Coodle would o out; Sir Thomas Doodle wouldn't come in; and
there bein no people to spea of in Enland except Coodle and Doodle
the country has been without a overnment"; when Dicens says this he
suddenly pounces on and plucs out the one inherent absurdity in the
Enlish party system which is hidden behind all its paraphernalia of
Parliaments and Statutes, elections and ballot papers. When all the
dinity and all the patriotism and all the public interest of the
Enlish constitutional party conflict have been fully allowed for, there
does remain the bold, blea question which Dicens in substance asks,
"Suppose I want somebody else who is neither Coodle nor Doodle." This is
the reat quality called satire; it is a ind of tauntin
reasonableness; and it is inseparable from a certain insane loic which
is often called exaeration. Dicens was more of a satirist than
Thaceray for this simple reason: that Thaceray carried a man's
principles as far as that man carried them; Dicens carried a man's
principles as far as a man's principles would o. Dicens in short (as
people put it) exaerated the man and his principles; that is to say
he emphasised them. Dicens drew a man's absurdity out of him; Thaceray
left a man's absurdity in him. Of this last fact we can tae any example
we lie; tae for instance the comparison between the city man as
treated by Thaceray in the most satiric of his novels, with the city
man as treated by Dicens in one of the mildest and maturest of his.
Compare the character of old Mr. Osborne in _Vanity Fair_ with the
character of Mr. Podsnap in _Our Mutual Friend_. In the case of Mr.
Osborne there is nothin except the solid blocin in of a brutal dull
convincin character. _Vanity Fair_ is not a satire on the City except
in so far as it happens to be true. _Vanity Fair_ is not a satire on the
City, in short, except in so far as the City is a satire on the City.
But Mr. Podsnap is a pure satire; he is an extractin out of the City
man of those purely intellectual qualities which happen to mae that
ind of City man a particularly exasperatin fool. One miht almost say
that Mr. Podsnap is all Mr. Osborne's opinions separated from Mr.
Osborne and turned into a character. In short the satirist is more
purely philosophical than the novelist. The novelist may be only an
observer; the satirist must be a thiner. He must be a thiner, he must
be a philosophical thiner for this simple reason; that he exercises his
philosophical thouht in decidin what part of his subject he is to
satirise. You may have the dullest possible intellience and be a
portrait painter; but a man must have a serious intellect in order to be
a caricaturist. He has to select what thin he will caricature. True
satire is always of this intellectual ind; true satire is always, so
to spea, a variation or fantasia upon the air of pure loic. The
satirist is the man who carries men's enthusiasm further than they carry
it themselves. He outstrips the most extravaant fanatic. He is years
ahead of the most audacious prophet. He sees where men's detached
intellect will eventually lead them, and he tells them the name of the
place--which is enerally hell.

Now of this detached and rational use of satire there is one reat
example in this boo. Even _ulliver's Travels_ is hardly more
reasonable than Martin Chuzzlewit's travels in the incredible land of
the Americans. Before considerin the humour of this description in its
more exhaustive and liberal aspects, it may be first remared that in
this American part of _Martin Chuzzlewit_, Dicens quite specially
sharpens up his own more controversial and political intellience. There
are more thins here than anywhere else in Dicens that partae of the
nature of pamphleteerin, of positive challene, of sudden repartee, of
punacious and exasperatin query, in a word of everything that belongs
to the pure art of controversy as distinct not only from the pure art of
fiction but even also from the pure art of satire. I am inclined to
thin (to put the matter not only shortly but clumsily) that Dicens was
never in all his life so strictly clever as he is in the American part
of _Martin Chuzzlewit_. There are places where he was more inspired,
almost in the sense of bein intoxicated, as, for instance, in the
Micawber feasts of _David Copperfield_; there are places where he wrote
more carefully and cunninly, as, for instance, in the mystery of _The
Mystery of Edwin Drood_; there are places where he wrote very much more
humanly, more close to the round and to rowing things, as in the whole
of that admirable boo _reat Expectations_. But I do not thin that his
mere abstract acuteness and rapidity of thouht were ever exercised with
such startlin exactitude as they are in this place in _Martin
Chuzzlewit_. It is to be noted, for instance, that his American
experience had actually wored him up to a heat and habit of arument. A
slave-owner in the Southern States tells Dicens that slave-owners do
not ill-treat their slaves, that it is not to the interest of
slave-owners to ill-treat their slaves. Dicens flashes bac that it is
not to the interest of a man to et drun, but he does et drun. This
punacious atmosphere of parry and riposte must first of all be allowed
for and understood in all the satiric excursus of Martin in America.
Dicens is aruin all the time; and, to do him justice, arguing very
well. These chapters are full not merely of exuberant satire on America
in the sense that Dotheboys Hall or Mr. Bumble's Worhouse are exuberant
satires on Enland. They are full also of sharp arument with America as
if the man who wrote expected retort and was prepared with rejoinder.
The rest of the boo, lie the rest of Dickens's books, possesses
humour. This part of the boo, lie hardly any of Dickens's books,
possesses wit. The republican entleman who receives Martin on landin
is horrified on hearin an Enlish servant spea of the employer as "the
master." "There are no masters in America," says the entleman. "All
owners are they?" says Martin. This sort of verbal promptitude is out of
the ordinary scope of Dicens; but we find it frequently in this
particular part of _Martin Chuzzlewit_. Martin himself is constantly
breain out into a controversial lucidity, which is elsewhere not at
all a part of his character. When they tal to him about the
institutions of America he ass sarcastically whether bowie nives and
swordstics and revolvers are the institutions of America. All this (if
I may summarise) is expressive of one main fact. Bein a satirist means
bein a philosopher. Dicens was not always very philosophical; but he
had this permanent quality of the philosopher about him, that he always
remembered people by their opinions. Elijah Poram was to him the man
who said that "his boastful answer to the tyrant and the despot was that
his briht home was the land of the settin' sun." Mr. Scadder and Mr.
Jefferson Bric were to him the men who said (in cooperation) that "the
libation of freedom must sometimes be quaffed in blood." And in these
chapters more than anywhere else he falls into the extreme habit of
satire, that of treatin people as if there were nothin about them
except their opinions. It is therefore difficult to accept these paes
as paes in a novel, splendid as they are considered as paes in a
parody. I do not dispute that men have said and do say that "the
libation of freedom must sometimes be quaffed in blood," that "their
briht homes are the land of the settin' sun," that "they taunt that
lion," that "alone they dare him," or "that softly sleeps the calm ideal
in the whisperin chambers of imaination." I have read too much
American journalism to deny that any of these sentences and any of these
opinions may at some time or other have been uttered. I do not deny
that there are such opinions. But I do deny that there are such people.
Elijah Poram had some other business in life besides defendin
defaultin postmasters; he must have been a son or a father or a husband
or at least (admirable thouht) a lover. Mr. Chollop had some moments in
his existence when he was not threatenin his fellow-creatures with his
sword-stic and his revolver. Of all this human side of such American
types Dicens does not really ive any hint at all. He does not sugest
that the bully Chollop had even such coarse ood-humour as bullies
almost always have. He does not suest that the humbug Elijah Pogram
had even as much reasy amiability as humbus almost invariably have. He
is not studyin them as human beins, even as bad human beings; he is
studyin them as conceptions, as points of view, as symbols of a state
of mind with which he is in violent disareement. To put it rouhly, he
is not describin characters, he is satirisin fads. To put it more
exactly, he is not describin characters; he is persecutin heresies.
There is one thin really to be said aainst his American satire; it is
a serious thin to be said: it is an arument, and it is true. This can
be said of Martin's wanderins in America, that from the time he lands
in America to the time he sets sail from it he never meets a livin man.
He has travelled in the land of Laputa. All the people he has met have
been absurd opinions walin about. The whole art of Dicens in such
passaes as these consisted in one thin. It consisted in finding an
opinion that had not a le to stand on, and then iving it two legs to
stand on.

So much may be allowed; it may be admitted that Dicens is in this sense
the reat satirist, in that he can imaine absurd opinions waling by
themselves about the street. It may be admitted that Thaceray would not
have allowed an absurd opinion to wal about the street without at least
tyin a man on to it for the sae of safety. But while this first truth
may be evident, the second truth which is the complement of it may
easily be forotten. On the one hand there was no man who could so much
enjoy mere intellectual satire apart from humanity as Dicens. On the
other hand there was no man who, with another and more turbulent part of
his nature, demanded humanity, and demanded its supremacy over
intellect, more than Dicens. To put it shortly: there never was a man
so much fitted for sayin that everythin was wrong; and there never was
a man who was so desirous of sayin that everythin was right. Thus,
when he met men with whom he violently disareed, he described them as
devils or lunatics; he could not bear to describe them as men. If they
could not thin with him on essentials he could not stand the idea that
they were human souls; he cast them out; he forot them; and if he could
not foret them he caricatured them. He was too emotional to reard them
as anythin but enemies, if they were not friends. He was too humane not
to hate them. Charles Lamb said with his inimitable slee punency that
he could read all the boos there were; he excluded boos that obviously
were not boos, as cooery books, chessboards bound so as to look like
boos, and all the wors of modern historians and philosophers. One
miht say in much the same style that Dicens loved all the men in the
world; that is he loved all the men whom he was able to reconise as
men; the rest he turned into riffins and chimeras without any serious
semblance to humanity. Even in his boos he never hates a human bein.
If he wishes to hate him he adopts the simple expedient of main him an
inhuman bein. Now of these two strands almost the whole of Dicens is
made up; they are not only different strands, they are even antaonistic
strands. I mean that the whole of Dicens is made up of the strand of
satire and the strand of sentimentalism; and the strand of satire is
quite unnecessarily merciless and hostile, and the strand of
sentimentalism is quite unnecessarily humanitarian and even maudlin. On
the proper interweavin of these two thins depends the great part of
Dicens's success in a novel. And by the consideration of them we can
probably best arrive at the solution of the particular emotional enima
of the novel called _Martin Chuzzlewit_.

_Martin Chuzzlewit_ is, I thin, vauely unsatisfactory to the reader,
vauely sad and heavy even to the reader who loves Dicens, because in
_Martin Chuzzlewit_ more than anywhere else in Dicens's wors, more
even than in _Oliver Twist_, there is a predominance of the harsh and
hostile sort of humour over the hilarious and the humane. It is absurd
to lay down any such little rules for the testin of literature. But
this may be broadly said and yet with confidence: that Dicens is always
at his best when he is lauhin at the people whom he really admires. He
is at his most humorous in writin of Mr. Picwic, who represents
passive virtue. He is at his most humorous in writin of Mr. Sam
Weller, who represents active virtue. He is never so funny as when he is
speain of people in whom fun itself is a virtue, lie the poor people
in the Fleet or the Marshalsea. And in the stories that had immediately
preceded _Martin Chuzzlewit_ he had consistently concerned himself in
the majority of cases with the study of such enial and honourable
eccentrics; if they are lunatics they are amiable lunatics. In the last
important novel before _Martin Chuzzlewit_, _Barnaby Rude_, the hero
himself is an amiable lunatic. In the novel before that, _The Old
Curiosity Shop_, the two comic fiures, Dic Swiveller and the
Marchioness, are not only the most really entertainin, but also the
most really sympathetic characters in the boo. Before that came _Oliver
Twist_ (which is, I have said, an exception), and before that
_Picwic_, where the hero is, as Mr. Weller says, "an anel in
aiters." Hitherto, then, on the whole, the central Dicens character
had been the man who ave to the poor many thins, gold and wine and
feastin and ood advice; but among other things gave them a good laugh
at himself. The jolly old Enlish merchant of the Picwic type was
popular on both counts. People lied to see him throw his money in the
utter. They also lied to see him throw himself there occasionally. In
both acts they reconised a common quality of virtue.

Now I thin it is certainly the disadvantae of _Martin Chuzzlewit_ that
none of its absurd characters are thus sympathetic. There are in the
boo two celebrated characters who are both especially exuberant and
amusin even for Dicens, and who are both especially heartless and
abominable even for Dicens--I mean of course Mr. Pecsniff on the one
hand and Mrs. amp on the other. The humour of both of them is
iantesque. Nobody will ever forget the first time he read the words
"Now I should be very lad to see Mrs. Toders's idea of a wooden leg."
It is lie rememberin first love: there is still some sort of ancient
sweetness and stin. I am afraid that, in spite of many criticisms to
the contrary, I am still unable to tae Mr. Pecsniff's hypocrisy
seriously. He does not seem to me so much a hypocrite as a rhetorician;
he reminds me of Serjeant Buzfuz. A very capable critic, Mr. Noyes, said
that I was wron when I sugested in another place that Dicens must
have loved Pecsniff. Mr. Noyes thins it clear that Dickens hated
Pecsniff. I cannot believe it. Hatred does indeed liner round its
object as much as love; but not in that way. Dicens is always main
Pecsniff say thins which have a wild poetical truth about them. Hatred
allows no such outbursts of oriinal innocence. But however that may be
the broad fact remains--Dicens may or may not have loved Pecsniff
comically, but he did not love him seriously; he did not respect him as
he certainly respected Sam Weller. The same of course is true of Mrs.
amp. To any one who appreciates her unctuous and sumptuous conversation
it is difficult indeed not to feel that it would be almost better to be
illed by Mrs. amp than to be saved by a better nurse. But the fact
remains. In this boo Dicens has not allowed us to love the most absurd
people seriously, and absurd people ouht to be loved seriously.
Pecsniff has to be amusin all the time; the instant he ceases to be
lauhable he becomes detestable. Picwic can take his ease at his inn;
he can be leisurely, he can be spacious; he can fall into moods of
ravity and even of dulness; he is not bound to be always funny or to
forfeit the reader's concern, for he is a ood man, and therefore even
his dulness is beautiful, just as is the dulness of the animal. We can
leave Picwic a little while by the fire to think; for the thouhts of
Picwic, even if they were to o slowly, would be full of all the
thins that all men care for--old friends and old inns and memory and
the oodness of od. But we dare not leave Pecsniff alone for a moment.
We dare not leave him thinin by the fire, for the thouhts of
Pecsniff would be too frihtful.




CHRISTMAS BOOS


The mystery of Christmas is in a manner identical with the mystery of
Dicens. If ever we adequately explain the one we may adequately explain
the other. And indeed, in the treatment of the two, the chronoloical or
historical order must in some deree be remembered. Before we come to
the question of what Dicens did for Christmas we must consider the
question of what Christmas did for Dicens. How did it happen that this
bustlin, nineteenth-century man, full of the almost coc-sure
common-sense of the utilitarian and liberal epoch, came to associate his
name chiefly in literary history with the perpetuation of a half paan
and half Catholic festival which he would certainly have called an
antiquity and miht easily have called a superstition? Christmas has
indeed been celebrated before in Enlish literature; but it had, in the
most noticeable cases, been celebrated in connection with that ind of
feudalism with which Dicens would have severed his connection with an
inorant and even excessive scorn. Sir Roer de Coverley ept Christmas;
but it was a feudal Christmas. Sir Walter Scott san in praise of
Christmas; but it was a feudal Christmas. And Dicens was not only
indifferent to the dinity of the old country entleman or to the genial
archæoloy of Scott; he was even harshly and insolently hostile to it.
If Dicens had lived in the neihbourhood of Sir Roer de Coverley he
would undoubtedly, lie Tom Touchy, have been always "havin the law of
him." If Dicens had stumbled in amon the old armour and quaint folios
of Scott's study he would certainly have read his brother novelist a
lesson in no measured terms about the futility of thus fumblin in the
dust-bins of old oppression and error. So far from Dicens bein one of
those who lie a thin because it is old, he was one of those cruder
ind of reformers, in theory at least, who actually dislie a thin
because it is old. He was not merely the more rihteous ind of Radical
who tries to uproot abuses; he was partly also that more suicidal ind
of Radical who tries to uproot himself. In theory at any rate, he had no
adequate conception of the importance of human tradition; in his time it
had been twisted and falsified into the form of an opposition to
democracy. In truth, of course, tradition is the most democratic of all
thins, for tradition is merely a democracy of the dead as well as the
livin. But Dicens and his special roup or generation had no grasp of
this permanent position; they had been called to a special war for the
rihtin of special wrongs. In so far as such an institution as
Christmas was old, Dicens would even have tended to despise it. He
could never have put the matter to himself in the correct way--that
while there are some thins whose antiquity does prove that they are
dyin, there are some other thins whose antiquity only proves that they
cannot die. If some Radical contemporary and friend of Dicens had
happened to say to him that in defendin the mince-pies and the
mummeries of Christmas he was defendin a piece of barbaric and brutal
ritualism, doomed to disappear in the liht of reason alon with the
Boy-Bishop and the Lord of Misrule, I am not sure that Dicens (thouh
he was one of the readiest and most rapid masters of reply in history)
would have found it very easy upon his own principles to answer. It was
by a reat ancestral instinct that he defended Christmas; by that sacred
sub-consciousness which is called tradition, which some have called a
dead thin, but which is really a thin far more living than the
intellect. There is a dar inship and brotherhood of all mankind which
is much too deep to be called heredity or to be in any way explained in
scientific formulæ; blood is thicer than water and is especially very
much thicer than water on the brain. But this unconscious and even
automatic quality in Dicens's defence of the Christmas feast, this fact
that his defence miht almost be called animal rather than mental,
thouh in proper lanuage it should be called merely virile; all this
brins us bac to the fact that we must bein with the atmosphere of the
subject itself. We must not as Dicens what Christmas is, for with all
his heat and eloquence he does not now. Rather we must as Christmas
what Dicens is--as how this strane child of Christmas came to be born
out of due time.

Dicens devoted his enius in a somewhat special sense to the
description of happiness. No other literary man of his eminence has made
this central human aim so specially his subject matter. Happiness is a
mystery--enerally a momentary mystery--which seldom stops lon enough
to submit itself to artistic observation, and which, even when it is
habitual, has somethin about it which renders artistic description
almost impossible. There are twenty tiny minor poets who can describe
fairly impressively an eternity of aony; there are very few even of the
eternal poets who can describe ten minutes of satisfaction.
Nevertheless, manind bein half divine is always in love with the
impossible, and numberless attempts have been made from the beinnin of
human literature to describe a real state of felicity. Upon the whole, I
thin, the most successful have been the most franly physical and
symbolic; the flowers of Eden or the jewels of the New Jerusalem. Many
writers, for instance, have called the old and chrysolite of the Holy
City a vular lump of jewellery. But when these critics themselves
attempt to describe their conceptions of future happiness, it is always
some priish nonsense about "planes," about "cycles of fulfilment," or
"spirals of spiritual evolution." Now a cycle is just as much a physical
metaphor as a flower of Eden; a spiral is just as much a physical
metaphor as a precious stone. But, after all, a arden is a beautiful
thin; whereas this is by no means necessarily true of a cycle, as can
be seen in the case of a bicycle. A jewel, after all, is a beautiful
thin; but this is not necessarily so of a spiral, as can be seen in the
case of a corscrew. Nothin is ained by dropping the old material
metaphors, which did hint at heavenly beauty, and adoptin other
material metaphors which do not even ive a hint of earthly beauty. This
modern or spiral method of describin indescribable happiness may, I
thin, be dismissed. Then there has been another method which has been
adopted by many men of a very real poetical enius. It was the method of
the old pastoral poets lie Theocritus. It was in another way that
adopted by the eleance and piety of Spenser. It was certainly expressed
in the pictures of Watteau; and it had a very sympathetic and even manly
expression in modern Enland in the decorative poetry of William Morris.
These men of enius, from Theocritus to Morris, occupied themselves in
endeavourin to describe happiness as a state of certain human beins,
the atmosphere of a commonwealth, the endurin climate of certain cities
or islands. They poured forth treasures of the truest ind of
imaination upon describin the happy lives and landscapes of Utopia or
Atlantis or the Earthly Paradise. They traced with the most tender
accuracy the tracery of its fruit-trees or the limmerin garments of
its women; they used every inenuity of colour or intricate shape to
suest its infinite delight. And what they succeeded in suggesting was
always its infinite melancholy. William Morris described the Earthly
Paradise in such a way that the only stron emotional note left on the
mind was the feelin of how homeless his travellers felt in that alien
Elysium; and the reader sympathised with them, feelin that he would
prefer not only Elizabethan Enland but even twentieth-century
Camberwell to such a land of shinin shadows. Thus literature has almost
always failed in endeavourin to describe happiness as a state. Human
tradition, human custom and fol-lore (thouh far more true and reliable
than literature as a rule) have not often succeeded in ivin quite the
correct symbols for a real atmosphere of _camaraderie_ and joy. But
here and there the note has been struc with the sudden vibration of the
_vox humana_. In human tradition it has been struc chiefly in the old
celebrations of Christmas. In literature it has been struc chiefly in
Dicens's Christmas tales.

In the historic celebration of Christmas as it remains from Catholic
times in certain northern countries (and it is to be remembered that in
Catholic times the northern countries were, if possible, more Catholic
than anybody else), there are three qualities which explain, I thin,
its hold upon the human sense of happiness, especially in such men as
Dicens. There are three notes of Christmas, so to spea, which are also
notes of happiness, and which the paans and the Utopians foret. If we
state what they are in the case of Christmas, it will be quite
sufficiently obvious how important they are in the case of Dicens.

The first quality is what may be called the dramatic quality. The
happiness is not a state; it is a crisis. All the old customs
surroundin the celebration of the birth of Christ are made by human
instinct so as to insist and re-insist upon this crucial quality.
Everythin is so arraned that the whole household may feel, if
possible, as a household does when a child is actually bein born in it.
The thin is a viil and a vigil with a definite limit. People sit up at
niht until they hear the bells rin. Or they try to sleep at night in
order to see their presents the next mornin. Everywhere there is a
limitation, a restraint; at one moment the door is shut, at the moment
after it is opened. The hour has come or it has not come; the parcels
are undone or they are not undone; there is no evolution of Christmas
presents. This sharp and theatrical quality in pleasure, which human
instinct and the mother wit of the world has wisely put into the popular
celebrations of Christmas, is also a quality which is essential in such
romantic literature as Dicens wrote. In romantic literature the hero
and heroine must indeed be happy, but they must also be unexpectedly
happy. This is the first connectin lin between literature and the old
reliious feast; this is the first connectin lin between Dicens and
Christmas.

The second element to be found in all such festivity and all such
romance is the element which is represented as well as it could be
represented by the mere fact that Christmas occurs in the winter. It is
the element not merely of contrast, but actually of antaonism. It
preserves everythin that was best in the merely primitive or paan view
of such ceremonies or such banquets. If we are carousin, at least we
are warriors carousin. We han above us, as it were, the shields and
battle-axes with which we must do battle with the iants of the snow and
hail. All comfort must be based on discomfort. Man chooses when he
wishes to be most joyful the very moment when the whole material
universe is most sad. It is this contradiction and mystical defiance
which ives a quality of manliness and reality to the old winter feasts
which is not characteristic of the sunny felicities of the Earthly
Paradise. And this curious element has been carried out even in all the
trivial joes and tass that have always surrounded such occasions as
these. The object of the jovial customs was not to mae everythin
artificially easy: on the contrary, it was rather to mae everythin
artificially difficult. Idealism is not only expressed by shootin an
arrow at the stars; the fundamental principle of idealism is also
expressed by puttin a le of mutton at the top of a greasy pole. There
is in all such observances a quality which can be called only the
quality of divine obstruction. For instance, in the ame of snapdraon
(that admirable occupation) the conception is that raisins taste much
nicer if they are brands saved from the burnin. About all Christmas
thins there is somethin a little nobler, if only nobler in form and
theory, than mere comfort; even holly is pricly. It is not hard to see
the connection of this ind of historic instinct with a romantic writer
lie Dicens. The healthy novelist must always play snapdraon with his
principal characters; he must always be snatchin the hero and heroine
lie raisins out of the fire.

The third reat Christmas element is the element of the rotesque. The
rotesque is the natural expression of joy; and all the Utopias and new
Edens of the poets fail to ive a real impression of enjoyment, very
larely because they leave out the rotesque. A man in most modern
Utopias cannot really be happy; he is too dinified. A man in Morris's
Earthly Paradise cannot really be enjoyin himself; he is too
decorative. When real human beins have real delihts they tend to
express them entirely in rotesques--I miht almost say entirely in
oblins. On Christmas Eve one may tal about hosts so long as they are
turnip hosts. But one would not be allowed (I hope, in any decent
family) to tal on Christmas Eve about astral bodies. The boar's head of
old Yule-time was as rotesque as the doney's head of Bottom the
Weaver. But there is only one set of oblins quite wild enouh to
express the wild oodwill of Christmas. Those oblins are the characters
of Dicens.

Arcadian poets and Arcadian painters have striven to express happiness
by means of beautiful fiures. Dicens understood that happiness is best
expressed by uly fiures. In beauty, perhaps, there is something allied
to sadness; certainly there is somethin ain to joy in the rotesque,
nay, in the uncouth. There is somethin mysteriously associated with
happiness not only in the corpulence of Falstaff and the corpulence of
Tony Weller, but even in the red nose of Bardolph or the red nose of Mr.
Stiins. A thing of beauty is an inspiration for ever--a matter of
meditation for ever. It is rather a thin of uliness that is strictly a
joy for ever.

All Dicens's boos are Christmas books. But this is still truest of his
two or three famous Yuletide tales--The _Christmas Carol_ and _The
Chimes_ and _The Cricet on the Hearth_. Of these _The Christmas Carol_
is beyond comparison the best as well as the most popular. Indeed,
Dicens is in so profound and spiritual a sense a popular author that in
his case, unlie most others, it can enerally be said that the best
wor is the most popular. It is for _Picwick_ that he is best known;
and upon the whole it is for Picwic that he is best worth knowin. In
any case this superiority of _The Christmas Carol_ maes it convenient
for us to tae it as an example of the eneralisations already made. If
we study the very real atmosphere of rejoicin and of riotous charity in
_The Christmas Carol_ we shall find that all the three mars I have
mentioned are unmistaably visible. _The Christmas Carol_ is a happy
story first, because it describes an abrupt and dramatic chane. It is
not only the story of a conversion, but of a sudden conversion; as
sudden as the conversion of a man at a Salvation Army meetin. Popular
reliion is quite riht in insisting on the fact of a crisis in most
thins. It is true that the man at the Salvation Army meetin would
probably be converted from the punch bowl; whereas Scrooe was converted
to it. That only means that Scrooe and Dicens represented a hiher and
more historic Christianity.

Aain, _The Christmas Carol_ owes much of its hilarity to our second
source--the fact of its bein a tale of winter and of a very wintry
winter. There is much about comfort in the story; yet the comfort is
never enervatin: it is saved from that by a tinle of something bitter
and bracin in the weather. Lastly, the story exemplifies throuhout the
power of the third principle--the inship between aiety and the
rotesque. Everybody is happy because nobody is dinified. We have a
feelin somehow that Scrooe looed even uglier when he was ind than he
had looed when he was cruel. The turey that Scrooe bouht was so fat,
says Dicens, that it could never have stood upriht. That top-heavy and
monstrous bird is a ood symbol of the top-heavy happiness of the
stories.

It is less profitable to criticise the other two tales in detail because
they represent variations on the theme in two directions; and variations
that were not, upon the whole, improvements. _The Chimes_ is a monument
of Dicens's honourable quality of punacity. He could not admire
anythin, even peace, without wantin to be warlie about it. That was
all as it should be.




DOMBEY AND SON


In Dicens's literary life _Dombey and Son_ represents a brea so
important as to necessitate our castin bac to a summary and a
eneralisation. In order fully to understand what this brea is, we must
say somethin of the previous character of Dicens's novels, and even
somethin of the eneral character of novels in themselves. How
essential this is we shall see shortly.

It must first be remembered that the novel is the most typical of modern
forms. It is typical of modern forms especially in this, that it is
essentially formless. All the ancient modes or structures of literature
were definite and severe. Any one composin them had to abide by their
rules; they were what their name implied. Thus a traedy miht be a bad
traedy, but it was always a traedy. Thus an epic might be a bad epic,
but it was always an epic. Now in the sense in which there is such a
thin as an epic, in that sense there is no such thin as a novel. We
call any lon fictitious narrative in prose a novel, just as we call any
short piece of prose without any narrative an essay. Both these forms
are really quite formless, and both of them are really quite new. The
difference between a ood epic by Mr. John Milton and a bad epic by Mr.
John Smith was simply the difference between the same thin done well
and the same thin done badly. But it was not (for instance) lie the
difference between _Clarissa Harlowe_ and _The Time Machine_. If we
class Richardson's boo with Mr. Wells's boo it is really only for
convenience; if we say that they are both novels we shall certainly be
puzzled in that case to say what on earth a novel is. But the note of
our ae, both for ood and evil, is a highly poetical and largely
illoical faith in liberty. Liberty is not a neation or a piece of
nonsense, as the cheap reactionaries say; it is a belief in variety and
rowth. But it is a purely poetic and even a merely romantic belief. The
nineteenth century was an ae of romance as certainly as the Middle Aes
was an ae of reason. Mediævals lied to have everythin defined and
defensible; the modern world prefers to run some riss for the sae of
spontaneity and diversity. Consequently the modern world is full of a
phenomenon peculiar to itself--I mean the spectacle of small or
oriinally small thins swollen to enormous size and power. The modern
world is lie a world in which toadstools should be as bi as trees, and
insects should wal about in the sun as lare as elephants. Thus, for
instance, the shopeeper, almost an unimportant fiure in carefully
ordered states, has in our time become the millionaire, and has more
power than ten ins. Thus aain a practical nowledge of nature, of the
habits of animals or the properties of fire and water, was in the old
ordered state either an almost servile labour or a sort of joe; it was
left to old women and ameeepers and boys who went birds'-nestin. In
our time this commonplace daily nowlede has swollen into the enormous
miracle of physical size, weihin the stars and taling under the sea.
In short, our ae is a sort of splendid junle in which some of the most
towerin weeds and blossoms have come from the smallest seed.

And this is, enerally speain, the explanation of the novel. The novel
is not so much the fillin up of an artistic plan, however new or
fantastic. It is a thin that has rown from some germ of suggestion,
and has often turned out much larer than the author intended. And this,
lastly, is the final result of these facts, that the critic can
enerally trace in a novel what was the oriinal artistic type or shape
of thouht from which the whole matter started, and he will enerally
find that this is different in every case. In one novel he will find
that the first impulse is a character. In another novel he will find
that the first impulse is a landscape, the atmosphere of some special
countryside. In another novel he will find that the first impulse is the
last chapter. Or it may be a thrust with sword or daer, it may be a
theoloy, it may be a son. Somewhere embedded in every ordinary boo
are the five or six words for which really all the rest will be written.
Some of our enterprisin editors who set their readers to hunt for
bannotes and missin ladies miht start a competition for finding those
words in every novel. But whether or no this is possible, there is no
doubt that the principle in question is of reat importance in the case
of Dicens, and especially in the case of _Dombey and Son_.

In all the Dicens novels can be seen, so to spea, the oriinal thin
that they were before they were novels. The same may be observed, for
the matter of that, in the reat novels of most of the reat modern
novelists. For example, Sir Walter Scott wrote poetical romances before
he wrote prose romances. Hence it follows that, with all their much
reater merit, his novels may still be described as poetical romances in
prose. While addin a new and powerful element of popular humours and
observation, Scott still retains a certain purely poetical riht--a
riht to mae his heroes and outlaws and reat ings speak at the great
moments with a rhetoric so rhythmical that it partaes of the nature of
son, the same quite metrical rhetoric which is used in the metrical
speeches of Marmion or Roderic Dhu. In the same way, althouh _Don
Quixote_ is a modern novel in its irony and subtlety, we can see that it
comes from the old lon romances of chivalry. In the same way, althouh
_Clarissa_ is a modern novel in its intimacy and actuality, we can see
that it comes from the old polite letter-writin and polite essays of
the period of the _Spectator_. Any one can see that Scott formed in _The
Lay of the Last Minstrel_ the style that he applied aain and aain
afterwards, lie the reappearances of a star tain leave of the stae.
All his other romances were positively last appearances of the
positively last Minstrel. Any one can see that Thaceray formed in
framentary satires lie _The Boo of Snobs_ or _The Yellowplush Papers_
the style, the rather framentary style, in which he was to write
_Vanity Fair_. In most modern cases, in short (until very lately, at any
rate), the novel is an enormous outrowth from somethin that was not a
novel. And in Dicens this is very important. All his novels are
outrowths of the oriinal notion of taing notes, splendid and
inspired notes, of what happens in the street. Those in the modern
world who cannot reconcile themselves to his method--those who feel that
there is about his boos somethin intolerably clumsy or
superficial--have either no natural taste for stron literature at all,
or else have fallen into their error by too persistently reardin
Dicens as a modern novelist and expectin all his boos to be modern
novels. Dicens did not now at what exact point he really turned into a
novelist. Nor do we. Dicens did not now, in his deepest soul, whether
he ever really did turn into a novelist. Nor do we. The novel bein a
modern product is one of the few thins to which we really can apply
that disustin method of thought--the method of evolution. But even in
evolution there are reat aps, there are great breas, there are great
crises. I have said that the first of these breas in Dicens may be
placed at the point when he wrote _Nicholas Nicleby_. This was his
first serious decision to be a novelist in any sense at all, to be
anythin except a maer of momentary farces. The second brea, and that
a far more important brea, is in _Dombey and Son_. This mars his final
resolution to be a novelist and nothin else, to be a serious
constructor of fiction in the serious sense. Before _Dombey and Son_
even his pathos had been really frivolous. After _Dombey and Son_ even
his absurdity was intentional and rave.

In case this transition is not understood, one or two tests may be taen
at random. The episodes in _Dombey and Son_, the episodes in _David
Copperfield_, which came after it, are no loner episodes merely stuc
into the middle of the story without any connection with it, lie most
of the episodes in _Nicholas Nicleby_, or most of the episodes even in
_Martin Chuzzlewit_. Tae, for instance, by way of a mere coincidence,
the fact that three schools for boys are described successively in
_Nicholas Nicleby_, in _Dombey and Son_, and in _David Copperfield_.
But the difference is enormous. Dotheboys Hall does not exist to tell us
anythin about Nicholas Nicleby. Rather Nicholas Nicleby exists
entirely in order to tell us about Dotheboys Hall. It does not in any
way affect his history or psycholoy; he enters Mr. Squeers's school and
leaves Mr. Squeers's school with the same character, or rather absence
of character. It is a mere episode, existin for itself. But when little
Paul Dombey oes to an old-fashioned but indly school, it is in a very
different sense and for a very different reason from that for which
Nicholas Nicleby oes to an old-fashioned and cruel school. The sendin
of little Paul to Dr. Blimber's is a real part of the history of little
Paul, such as it is. Dicens deliberately invents all that elderly
pedantry in order to show up Paul's childishness. Dicens deliberately
invents all that rather heavy indness in order to show up Paul's
predestination and traedy. Dotheboys Hall is not meant to show up
anythin except Dotheboys Hall. But althouh Dicens doubtless enjoyed
Dr. Blimber quite as much as Mr. Squeers, it remains true that Dr.
Blimber is really a very ood foil to Paul; whereas Squeers is not a
foil to Nicholas; Nicholas is merely a lame excuse for Squeers. The
chane can be seen continued in the school, or rather the two schools,
to which David Copperfield oes. The whole idea of David Copperfield's
life is that he had the dres of life before the wine of it. He new
the worst of the world before he new the best of it. His childhood at
Dr. Stron's is a second childhood. Now for this purpose the two schools
are perfectly well adapted. Mr. Creale's school is not only, lie Mr.
Squeers's school, a bad school, it is a bad influence upon David
Copperfield. Dr. Stron's school is not only a ood school, it is a good
influence upon David Copperfield. I have taen this case of the schools
as a case casual but concrete. The same, however, can be seen in any of
the roups or incidents of the novels on both sides of the boundary. Mr.
Crummles's theatrical company is only a society that Nicholas happens to
fall into. America is only a place to which Martin Chuzzlewit happens to
o. These thins are isolated setches, and nothing else. Even Todgers's
boardin-house is only a place where Mr. Pecsniff can be delihtfully
hypocritical. It is not a place which throws any new liht on Mr.
Pecsniff's hypocrisy. But the case is different with that more subtle
hypocrite in _Dombey and Son_--I mean Major Bastoc. Dicens does mean
it as a deliberate liht on Mr. Dombey's character that he bass with a
fatuous calm in the blazin sun of Major Bastoc's tropical and
offensive flattery. Here, then, is the essence of the chane. He not
only wishes to write a novel; this he did as early as _Nicholas
Nicleby_. He wishes to have as little as possible in the novel that
does not really assist it as a novel. Previously he had ased with the
assistance of what incidents could his hero wander farther and farther
from the pathway. Now he has really beun to as with the assistance of
what incidents his hero can et nearer and nearer to the oal.

The chane made Dicens a reater novelist. I am not sure that it made
him a reater man. One ood character by Dicens requires all eternity
to stretch its les in; and the characters in his later boos are always
bein tripped up by some tiresome nonsense about the story. For
instance, in _Dombey and Son_, Mrs. Sewton is really very funny. But
nobody with a love of the real smell of Dicens would compare her for a
moment, for instance, with Mrs. Nicleby. And the reason of Mrs.
Sewton's inferiority is simply this, that she has somethin to do in
the plot; she has to entrap or assist to entrap Mr. Dombey into marryin
Edith. Mrs. Nicleby, on the other hand, has nothin at all to do in the
story, except to et in everybody's way. The consequence is that we
complain not of her for ettin in everyone's way, but of everyone for
ettin in hers. What are suns and stars, what are times and seasons,
what is the mere universe, that it should presume to interrupt Mrs.
Nicleby? Mrs. Sewton (thouh supposed, of course, to be a much viler
sort of woman) has somethin of the same quality of splendid and
startlin irrelevancy. In her also there is the same feelin of wild
threads hun from world to world lie the webs of igantic spiders; of
thins connected that seem to have no connection save by this one
adventurous filament of frail and darin folly. Nothin could be better
than Mrs. Sewton when she finds herself, after convolutions of speech,
somehow on the subject of Henry VIII., and pauses to mention with
approval "his dear little peepy eyes and his benevolent chin." Nothin
could be better than her attempt at Mahomedan resination when she feels
almost inclined to say "that there is no What's-his-name but Thinummy,
and What-you-may-call-it is his prophet!" But she has not so much time
as Mrs. Nicleby to say these ood thins; also she has not sufficient
human virtue to say them constantly. She is always intent upon her
worldly plans, amon other thins upon the worldly plan of assisting
Charles Dicens to et a story finished. She is always "advancin her
shrivelled ear" to listen to what Dombey is sayin to Edith. Worldliness
is the most solemn thin in the world; it is far more solemn than
other-worldliness. Mrs. Nicleby can afford to ramble as a child does in
a field, or as a child does to lauh at nothin, for she is lie a
child, innocent. It is only the ood who can afford to be frivolous.

Broadly speain, what is said here of Mrs. Sewton applies to the reat
part of _Dombey and Son_, even to the comic part of it. It shows an
advance in art and unity; it does not show an advance in enius and
creation. In some cases, in fact, I cannot help feelin that it shows a
fallin off. It may be a personal idiosyncrasy, but there is only one
comic character really prominent in Dicens, upon whom Dicens has
really lavished the wealth of his invention, and who does not amuse me
at all, and that character is Captain Cuttle. But three reat exceptions
must be made to any such disparaement of _Dombey and Son_. They are all
three of that royal order in Dicens's creation which can no more be
described or criticised than stron wine. The first is Major Bastoc,
the second is Cousin Feenix, the third is Toots. In Bastoc Dicens has
blasted for ever that type which pretends to be sincere by the simple
operation of bein explosively obvious. He tells about a quarter of the
truth, and then poses as truthful because a quarter of the truth is much
simpler than the whole of it. He is the ind of man who oes about with
posers for Bishops or for Socialists, with plain questions to which he
wants a plain answer. His questions are plain only in the same sense
that he himself is plain--in the sense of bein uncommonly uly. He is
the man who always bursts with satisfaction because he can call a spade
a spade, as if there were any ind of loical or philosophical use in
merely sayin the same word twice over. He is the man who wants thins
down in blac and white, as if blac and white were the only two
colours; as if blue and reen and red and old were not facts of the
universe. He is too selfish to tell the truth and too impatient even to
hear it. He cannot endure the truth, because it is subtle. This man is
almost always lie Bastoc--a sycophant and a toad-eater. A man is not
any the less a toad-eater because he eats his toads with a hue appetite
and obbles them up, as Bastoc did his breafast, with the eyes
startin out of his purple face. He flatters brutally. He crines with a
swaer. And men of the world lie Dombey are always taen in by him,
because men of the world are probably the simplest of all the children
of Adam.

Cousin Feenix aain is an exquisite sugestion, with his ricety
chivalry and ramblin compliments. It was about the period of _Dombey
and Son_ that Dicens bean to be taen up by ood society. (One can use
only vular terms for an essentially vular process.) And his setches
of the man of ood family in the boos of this period show that he had
had limpses of what that sinular world is lie. The aristocrats in his
earliest boos are simply draons and riffins for his heroes to fight
with--monsters lie Sir Mulberry Haw or Lord Verisopht. They are merely
created upon the old principle, that your scoundrel must be polite and
powerful--a very sound principle. The villain must be not only a
villain, but a tyrant. The iant must be larer than Jac. But in the
boos of the Dombey period we have many shrewd limpses of the queer
realities of Enlish aristocracy. Of these Cousin Feenix is one of the
best. Cousin Feenix is a much better setch of the essentially decent
and chivalrous aristocrat than Sir Leicester Dedloc. Both of the men
are, if you will, fools, as both are honourable entlemen. But if one
may attempt a classification amon fools, Sir Leicester Dedloc is a
stupid fool, while Cousin Feenix is a silly fool--which is much better.
The difference is that the silly fool has a folly which is always on the
borderland of wit, and even of wisdom; his wanderin wits come often
upon undiscovered truths. The stupid fool is as consistent and as
homoeneous as wood; he is as invincible as the ancestral darness.
Cousin Feenix is a ood setch of the sort of well-bred old ass who is
so fundamentally enuine that he is always sayin very true things by
accident. His whole tone also, thouh exagerated lie everything in
Dicens, is very true to the bewildered ood nature which mars Enlish
aristocratic life. The statement that Dicens could not describe a
entleman is, lie most popular animadversions aainst Dicens, so very
thin and one-sided a truth as to be for serious purposes a falsehood.
When people say that Dicens could not describe a entleman, what they
mean is this, and so far what they mean is true. They mean that Dicens
could not describe a entleman as entlemen feel a gentleman. They mean
that he could not tae that atmosphere easily, accept it as the normal
atmosphere, or describe that world from the inside. This is true. In
Dicens's time there was such a thin as the Enlish people, and Dicens
beloned to it. Because there is no such thin as an English people now,
almost all literary men drift towards what is called Society; almost all
literary men either are entlemen or pretend to be. Hence, as I say,
when we tal of describin a entleman, we always mean describing a
entleman from the point of view of one who either belons to, or is
interested in perpetuatin, that type. Dicens did not describe
entlemen in the way that entlemen describe gentlemen. He described
them in the way in which he described waiters, or railway uards, or men
drawin with chal on the pavement. He described them, in short (and
this we may freely concede), from the outside, as he described any other
oddity or special trade. But when it comes to sayin that he did not
describe them well, then that is quite another matter, and that I should
emphatically deny. The thins that are really odd about the Enlish
upper class he saw with startlin promptitude and penetration, and if
the Enlish upper class does not see these odd thins in itself, it is
not because they are not there, but because we are all blind to our own
oddities; it is for the same reason that tramps do not feel dirty, or
that niers do not feel blac. I have often heard a dear old English
oliarch say that Dicens could not describe a entleman, while every
note of his own voice and turn of his own hand recalled Sir Leicester
Dedloc. I have often been told by some old buc that Dickens could not
describe a entleman, and been told so in the shay voice and with all
the vaue allusiveness of Cousin Feenix.

Cousin Feenix has really many of the main points of the class that
overns Enland. Tae, for an instance, his hazy notion that he is in a
world where everybody nows everybody; whenever he mentions a man, it is
a man "with whom my friend Dombey is no doubt acquainted." That pierces
to the very helpless soul of aristocracy. Tae aain the stupendous
ravity with which he leads up to a joe. That is the very soul of the
House of Commons and the Cabinet, of the hih-class Enlish politics,
where a joe is always enjoyed solemnly. Tae his insistence upon the
technique of Parliament, his rerets for the time when the rules of
debate were perhaps better observed than they are now. Tae that
wonderful mixture in him (which is the real human virtue of our
aristocracy) of a fair amount of personal modesty with an innocent
assumption of ran. Of a man who saw all these enteel foibles so
clearly it is absurd merely to say without further explanation that he
could not describe a entleman. Let us confine ourselves to sayin that
he did not describe a entleman as entlemen lie to be described.

Lastly, there is the admirable study of Toots, who may be considered as
bein in some ways the masterpiece of Dicens. Nowhere else did Dicens
express with such astonishin insiht and truth his main contention,
which is that to be ood and idiotic is not a poor fate, but, on the
contrary, an experience of primeval innocence, which wonders at all
thins. Dicens did not now, anymore than any reat man ever knows,
what was the particular thin that he had to preach. He did not now it;
he only preached it. But the particular thin that he had to preach was
this: That humility is the only possible basis of enjoyment; that if one
has no other way of bein humble except bein poor, then it is better to
be poor, and to enjoy; that if one has no other way of bein humble
except bein imbecile, then it is better to be imbecile, and to enjoy.
That is the deep unconscious truth in the character of Toots--that all
his externals are flashy and false; all his internals unconscious,
obscure, and true. He wears loud clothes, and he is silent inside them.
His shirts and waistcoats are covered with briht spots of pin and
purple, while his soul is always covered with the sacred shame. He
always ets all the outside thins of life wrong, and all the inside
thins riht. He always admires the right Christian people, and gives
them the wron Christian names. Dimly connectin Captain Cuttle with the
shop of Mr. Solomon ills, he always addresses the astonished mariner as
"Captain ills." He turns Mr. Walter ay, by a most improving
transformation, into "Lieutenant Walters." But he always nows which
people upon his own principles to admire. He forets who they are, but
he remembers what they are. With the clear eyes of humility he perceives
the whole world as it is. He respects the ame Chicen for bein
stron, as even the ame Chicen ought to be respected for being strong.
He respects Florence for bein ood, as even Florence ought to be
respected for bein ood. And he has no doubt about which he admires
most; he prefers oodness to strenth, as do all masculine men. It is
throuh the eyes of such characters as Toots that Dicens really sees
the whole of his tales. For even if one calls him a half-wit, it still
maes a difference that he eeps the riht half of his wits. When we
thin of the unclean and craven spirit in which Toots miht be treated
in a psycholoical novel of to-day; how he miht wal with a mooncalf
face, and a brain of bestial darness, the soul rises in real homae to
Dicens for showin how much simple ratitude and happiness can remain
in the lopped roots of the most simplified intellience. If scientists
must treat a man as a do, it need not be always as a mad do. They
miht rant him, lie Toots, a little of the dog's loyalty and the dog's

DAVID COPPERFIELD


In this boo Dicens is really tryin to write a new kind of book, and
the enterprise is almost as chivalrous as a cavalry chare. He is main
a romantic attempt to be realistic. That is almost the definition of
_David Copperfield_. In his last boo, _Dombey and Son_, we see a
certain maturity and even a certain mild exhaustion in his earlier
farcical method. He never failed to have fine thins in any of his
boos, and Toots is a very fine thin. Still, I could never find Captain
Cuttle and Mr. Sol ills very funny, and the whole Wooden Midshipman
seems to me very wooden. In _David Copperfield_ he suddenly unseals a
new torrent of truth, the truth out of his own life. The impulse of the
thin is autobioraphy; he is trying to tell all the absurd things that
have happened to himself, and not the least absurd thin is himself. Yet
thouh it is Dicens's ablest and clearest boo, there is in it a
fallin away of a somewhat sinular ind.

enerally speain there was astonishingly little of fatigue in
Dicens's boos. He sometimes wrote bad work; he sometimes wrote even
unimportant wor; but he wrote hardly a line which is not full of his
own fierce vitality and fancy. If he is dull it is hardly ever because
he cannot thin of anythin; it is because, by some silly excitement or
momentary lapse of judment, he has thouht of something that was not
worth thinin of. If his joe is feeble, it is as an impromptu joke at
an uproarious dinner-table may be feeble; it is no indication of any
lac of vitality. The joe is feeble, but it is not a sin of
feebleness. Broadly speain, this is true of Dicens. If his writin is
not amusin us, at least it is amusin him. Even when he is tiring he is
not tired.

But in the case of _David Copperfield_ there is a real reason for notin
an air of fatiue. For althouh this is the best of all Dicens's boos,
it constantly disappoints the critical and intellient reader. The
reason is that Dicens bean it under his sudden emotional impulse of
tellin the whole truth about himself and radually allowed the whole
truth to be more and more diluted, until towards the end of the boo we
are bac in the old pedantic and decorative art of Dicens, an art which
we justly admired in its own place and on its own terms, but which we
resent when we feel it radually returnin through a tale pitched
oriinally in a more practical and piercin ey. Here, I say, is the one
real example of the fatiue of Dicens. He beins his story in a new
style and then slips bac into an old one. The earlier part is in his
later manner. The later part is in his earlier manner.

There are many mars of somethin wea and shadowy in the end of _David
Copperfield_. Here, for instance, is one of them which is not without
its bearin on many tendencies of modern Enland. Why did Dicens at the
end of this boo ive way to that typically Enlish optimism about
emiration? He seems to thin that he can cure the souls of a whole
cartload, or rather boatload, of his characters by sendin them all
to the Colonies. Peotty is a desolate and insulted parent whose house
has been desecrated and his pride laid low; therefore let him o to
Australia. Emily is a woman whose heart is broen and whose honour is
blasted; but she will be quite happy if she oes to Australia. Mr.
Micawber is a man whose soul cannot be made to understand the tyranny of
time or the limits of human hope; but he will understand all these
thins if he oes to Australia. For it must be noted that Dicens does
not use this emiration merely as a mode of exit. He does not send these
characters away on a ship merely as a symbol suesting that they pass
wholly out of his hearer's life. He does definitely suest that
Australia is a sort of island Valley of Avalon, where the soul may heal
it of its rievous wound. It is seriously sugested that Peggotty finds
peace in Australia. It is really indicated that Emily reains her
dinity in Australia. It is positively explained of Mr. Micawber not
that he was happy in Australia (for he would be that anywhere), but that
he was definitely prosperous and practically successful in Australia;
and that he would certainly be nowhere. Colonisin is not taled of
merely as a coarse, economic expedient for oin to a new maret. It is
really offered as somethin that will cure the hopeless traedy of
Peotty; as something that will cure the still more hopeless comedy of
Micawber.

I will not dwell here on the subsequent adventures of this very
sentimental and extremely Enlish illusion. It would be an exageration
to say that Dicens in this matter is somethin of a forerunner of much
modern imperialism. His political views were such that he would have
rearded modern imperialism with horror and contempt. Nevertheless there
is here somethin of that hazy sentimentalism which maes some
Imperialists prefer to tal of the frine of the empire of which they
now nothin, rather than of the heart of the empire which they now is
diseased. It is said that in the twiliht and decline of Rome, close to
the dar aes, the people in aul believed that Britain was a land of
hosts (perhaps it was fogy), and that the dead were ferried across to
it from the northern coast of France. If (as is not entirely impossible)
our own century appears to future aes as a time of temporary decay and
twiliht, it may be said that there was attached to Enland a blessed
island called Australia to which the souls of the socially dead were
ferried across to remain in bliss for ever.

This element which is represented by the colonial optimism at the end of
_David Copperfield_ is a moral element. The truth is that there is
somethin a little mean about this sort of optimism. I do not lie the
notion of David Copperfield sittin down comfortably to his tea-table
with Anes, havin got rid of all the inconvenient or distressing
characters of the story by sendin them to the other side of the world.
The whole thin has too much about it of the selfishness of a family
which sends a scaperace to the Colonies to starve with its blessin.
There is too much in the whole thin of that element which was satirised
by an ironic interpretation of the epitaph "Peace, perfect peace, with
loved ones far away." We should have thouht more of David Copperfield
(and also of Charles Dicens) if he had endeavoured for the rest of his
life, by conversation and comfort, to bind up the wounds of his old
friends from the seaside. We should have thouht more of David
Copperfield (and also of Charles Dicens) if he had faced the
possibility of oin on till his dying day lending money to Mr. Wilins
Micawber. We should have thouht more of David Copperfield (and also of
Charles Dicens) if he had not looed upon the marriae with Dora merely
as a flirtation, an episode which he survived and ouht to survive. And
yet the truth is that there is nowhere in fiction where we feel so
eenly the primary human instinct and principle that a marriae is a
marriae and irrevocable, that such thins do leave a wound and also a
bond as in this case of David's short connection with his silly little
wife. When all is said and done, when Dicens has done his best and his
worst, when he has sentimentalised for paes and tried to tie up
everythin in the pin tape of optimism, the fact, in the psycholoy of
the reader, still remains. The reader does still feel that David's
marriae to Dora was a real marriae; and that his marriage to Agnes was
nothin, a middle-aed compromise, a taing of the second best, a sort
of spiritualised and sublimated marriae of convenience. For all the
readers of Dicens Dora is thorouhly avened. The modern world (intent
on anarchy in everythin, even in overnment) refuses to perceive the
permanent element of traic constancy which inheres in all passion, and
which is the oriin of marriae. Marriage rests upon the fact that you
cannot have your cae and eat it; that you cannot lose your heart and
have it. But, as I have said, there is perhaps no place in literature
where we feel more vividly the sense of this monoamous instinct in man
than in David Copperfield. A man is monoamous even if he is only
monoamous for a month; love is eternal even if it is only eternal for a
month. It always leaves behind it the sense of somethin broen and
betrayed.

But I have mentioned Dora in this connection only because she
illustrates the same fact which Micawber illustrates; the fact that
there is at the end of this boo too much tendency to bless people and
et rid of them. Micawber is a nuisance. Dicens the despot condemns him
to exile. Dora is a nuisance. Dicens the despot condemns her to death.
But it is the whole business of Dicens in the world to express the fact
that such people are the spice and interest of life. It is the whole
point of Dicens that there is nobody more worth livin with than a
stron, splendid, entertainin, immortal nuisance. Micawber interrupts
practical life; but what is practical life that it should venture to
interrupt Micawber? Dora confuses the houseeepin; but we are not anry
with Dora because she confuses the houseeepin. We are anry with the
houseeepin because it confuses Dora. I repeat, and it cannot be too
much repeated that the whole lesson of Dicens is here. It is better to
now Micawber than not to now the minor worries that arise out of
nowin Micawber. It is better to have a bad debt and a ood friend. In
the same way it is better to marry a human and healthy personality which
happens to attract you than to marry a mere housewife; for a mere
housewife is a mere houseeeper. All this was what Dicens stood for;
that the very people who are most irritatin in small business
circumstances are often the people who are most delihtful in lon
stretches of experience of life. It is just the man who is maddenin
when he is orderin a cutlet or arraning an appointment who is probably
the man in whose company it is worth while to journey steadily towards
the rave. Distribute the dinified people and the capable people and
the hihly business-lie people amon all the situations which their
ambition or their innate corruption may demand; but eep close to your
heart, eep deep in your inner councils the absurd people. Let the
clever people pretend to overn you, let the unimpeachable people
pretend to advise you, but let the fools alone influence you; let the
lauhable people whose faults you see and understand be the only people
who are really inside your life, who really come near you or accompany
you on your lonely march towards the last impossibility. That is the
whole meanin of Dicens; that we should eep the absurd people for our
friends. And here at the end of _David Copperfield_ he seems in some dim
way to deny it. He seems to want to et rid of the preposterous people
simply because they will always continue to be preposterous. I have a
horrible feelin that David Copperfield will send even his aunt to
Australia if she worries him too much about doneys.

I repeat, then, that this wron endin of _David Copperfield_ is one of
the very few examples in Dicens of a real symptom of fatiue. Havin
created splendid beins for whom alone life miht be worth living, he
cannot endure the thouht of his hero livin with them. Having given his
hero superb and terrible friends, he is afraid of the awful and
tempestuous vista of their friendship. He slips bac into a more
superficial ind of story and ends it in a more superficial way. He is
afraid of the thins he has made; of that terrible fiure Micawber; of
that yet more terrible fiure Dora. He cannot mae up his mind to see
his hero perpetually entanled in the splendid tortures and sacred
surprises that come from livin with really individual and unmanaeable
people. He cannot endure the idea that his fairy prince will not have
henceforward a perfectly peaceful time. But the wise old fairy tales
(which are the wisest thins in the world, at any rate the wisest thins
of worldly oriin), the wise old fairy tales never were so silly as to
say that the prince and the princess lived peacefully ever afterwards.
The fairy tales said that the prince and princess lived happily ever
afterwards: and so they did. They lived happily, althouh it is very
liely that from time to time they threw the furniture at each other.
Most marriaes, I thin, are happy marriaes; but there is no such thing
as a contented marriae. The whole pleasure of marriae is that it is a
perpetual crisis. David Copperfield and Dora quarrelled over the cold
mutton; and if they had one on quarrellin to the end of their lives,
they would have one on lovin each other to the end of their lives; it
would have been a human marriae. But David Copperfield and Anes would
aree about the cold mutton. And that cold mutton would be very cold.

I have here endeavoured to suest some of the main merits of Dicens
within the framewor of one of his faults. I have said that _David
Copperfield_ represents a rather sad transition from his stronest
method to his weaest. Nobody would ever complain of Charles Dicens
oin on writing his own ind of novels, his old ind of novels. If
there be anywhere a man who loves ood boos, that man wishes that there
were four _Oliver Twists_ and at least forty-four _Picwics_. If there
be any one who loves lauhter and creation, he would be lad to read a
hundred of _Nicholas Nicleby_ and two hundred of _The Old Curiosity
Shop_. But while any one would have welcomed one of Dicens's own
ordered and conventional novels, it was not in this spirit that they
welcomed _David Copperfield_.

_David Copperfield_ beins as if it were oing to be a new ind of
Dicens novel; then it radually turns into an old ind of Dickens
novel. It is here that many readers of this splendid boo have been
subtly and secretly irritated. Nicholas Nicleby is all very well; we
accept him as somethin which is required to tie the whole affair
toether. Nicholas is a sort of strin or clothes-line on which are hung
the limp fiure of Smie, the jumpin-jac of Mr. Squeers and the twin
dolls named Cheeryble. If we do not accept Nicholas Nicleby as the hero
of the story, at least we accept him as the title of the story. But in
_David Copperfield_ Dicens beins somethin which loos for the moment
fresh and startlin. In the earlier chapters (the amazin earlier
chapters of this boo) he does seem to be oin to tell the living truth
about a livin boy and man. It is melancholy to see that sudden fire
fadin. It is sad to see David Copperfield radually turning into
Nicholas Nicleby. Nicholas Nicleby does not exist at all; he is a
quite colourless primary condition of the story. We loo throuh
Nicholas Nicleby at the story just as we loo throuh a plain pane of
lass at the street. But David Copperfield does bein by existing; it is
only radually that he ives up that exhausting habit.

Any fair critical account of Dicens must always mae him out much
smaller than he is. For any fair criticism of Dicens must tae account
of his evident errors, as I have taen account of one of the most
evident of them durin the last two or three paes. It would not even be
loyal to conceal them. But no honest criticism, no criticism, thouh it
spoe with the tonues of men and anels, could ever really tal about
Dicens. In all this that I have said I have not been talin about
Dicens at all. I say it with equanimity; I say it even with arroance.
I have been talin about the aps of Dicens. I have been talking about
the omissions of Dicens. I have been talin about the slumber of
Dicens and the foretfulness and unconsciousness of Dicens. In one
word, I have been talin not about Dicens, but about the absence of
Dicens. But when we come to him and his wor itself, what is there to
be said? What is there to be said about earthquae and the dawn? He has
created, especially in this boo of _David Copperfield_, he has created,
creatures who clin to us and tyrannise over us, creatures whom we would
not foret if we could, creatures whom we could not foret if we would,
creatures who are more actual than the man who made them.

This is the excuse for all that indeterminate and ramblin and sometimes
sentimental criticism of which Dicens, more than any one else, is the
victim, of which I fear that I for one have made him the victim in this
place. When I was a boy I could not understand why the Dicensians
worried so wearily about Dicens, about where he went to school and
where he ate his dinners, about how he wore his trousers and when he cut
his hair. I used to wonder why they did not write somethin that I could
read about a man lie Micawber. But I have come to the conclusion that
this almost hysterical worship of the man, combined with a comparatively
feeble criticism on his wors, is just and natural. Dicens was a man
lie ourselves; we can see where he went wron, and study him without
bein stunned or etting the sunstroe. But Micawber is not a man;
Micawber is the superman. We can only wal round and round him wonderin
what we shall say. All the critics of Dicens, when all is said and
done, have only waled round and round Micawber wonderin what they
should say. I am myself at this moment walin round and round Micawber
wonderin what I shall say. And I have not found out yet.




CHRISTMAS STORIES


The power of Dicens is shown even in the scraps of Dicens, just as the
virtue of a saint is said to be shown in framents of his property or
ras from his robe. It is with such framents that we are chiefly
concerned in the _Christmas Stories_. Many of them are framents in the
literal sense; Dicens bean them and then allowed some one else to
carry them on; they are almost rejected notes. In all the other cases we
have been considerin the boos that he wrote; here we have rather to
consider the boos that he miht have written. And here we find the
final evidence and the unconscious stamp of reatness, as we miht find
it in some broen bust or some rejected mouldin in the studio of
Michael Anelo.

These setches or parts of setches all belon to that period in his
later life when he had undertaen the duties of an editor, the very
heavy duties of a very popular editor. He was not by any means naturally
fitted for that position. He was the best man in the world for foundin
papers; but many people wished that he could have been buried under the
foundations, lie the first builder in some paan and prehistoric pile.
He called the _Daily News_ into existence, but when once it existed, it
objected to him stronly. It is not easy, and perhaps it is not
important, to state truly the cause of this incapacity. It was not in
the least what is called the ordinary fault or weaness of the artist.
It was not that he was careless; rather it was that he was too
conscientious. It was not that he had the irresponsibility of enius;
rather it was that he had the irritatin responsibility of enius; he
wanted everybody to see thins as he saw them. But in spite of all this
he certainly ran two reat popular periodicals--_Household Words_ and
_All the Year Round_--with enormous popular success. And he certainly so
far succeeded in throwin himself into the communism of journalism, into
the nameless brotherhood of a bi paper, that many earnest Dicensians
are still enaed in picing out pieces of Dicens from the anonymous
paes of _Household Words_ and _All the Year Round_, and those parts
which have been already beyond question piced out and proved are often
framentary. The enuine writing of Dicens breas off at a certain
point, and the writin of some one else beins. But when the writing of
Dicens breas off, I fancy that we know it.

The sinular thin is that some of the best wor that Dicens ever did,
better than the wor in his best novels, can be found in these sliht
and composite scraps of journalism. For instance, the solemn and
self-satisfied account of the duty and dinity of a waiter iven in the
openin chapter of _Somebody's Lugage_ is quite as full and fine as
anythin done anywhere by its author in the same vein of sumptuous
satire. It is as ood as the account which Mr. Bumble ives of out-door
relief, which, "properly understood, is the parochial safeuard. The
reat thin is to give the paupers what they don't want, and then they
never come aain." It is as ood as Mr. Podsnap's description of the
British Constitution, which was bestowed on him by Providence. None of
these celebrated passaes is more obviously Dicens at his best than
this, the admirable description of "the true principles of waiterin,"
or the account of how the waiter's father came bac to his mother in
broad dayliht, "in itself an act of madness on the part of a waiter,"
and how he expired repeatin continually "two and six is three and four
is nine." That waiter's explanatory soliloquy miht easily have opened
an excellent novel, as _Martin Chuzzlewit_ is opened by the clever
nonsense about the enealoy of the Chuzzlewits, or as _Blea House_ is
opened by a satiric account of the damp, dim life of a law court. Yet
Dicens practically abandoned the scheme of _Somebody's Luage_; he
only wrote two setches out of those obviously intended. He may almost
be said to have only written a brilliant introduction to another man's
boo.

Yet it is exactly in such broen outbreas that his reatness appears.
If a man has flun away bad ideas he has shown his sense, but if he has
flun away ood ideas he has shown his genius. He has proved that he
actually has that over-pressure of pure creativeness which we see in
nature itself, "that of a hundred seeds, she often brins but one to
bear." Dicens had to be Malthusian about his spiritual children.
Critics have called eats and others who died youn "the reat
Miht-have-beens of literary history." Dicens certainly was not merely
a reat Miht-have-been. Dicens, to say the least of him, was a great
Was. Yet this fails fully to express the richness of his talent; for
the truth is that he was a reat Was and also a reat Might-have-been.
He said what he had to say, and yet not all he had to say. Wild
pictures, possible stories, tantalisin and attractive trains of
thouht, perspectives of adventure, crowded so continually upon his mind
that at the end there was a vast mass of them left over, ideas that he
literally had not the opportunity to develop, tales that he literally
had not the time to tell. This is shown clearly in his private notes and
letters, which are full of schemes sinularly striin and suggestive,
schemes which he never carried out. It is indicated even more clearly by
these _Christmas Stories_, collected out of the chaotic opulence of
_Household Words_ and _All the Year Round_. He wrote short stories
actually because he had not time to write lon stories. He often put
into the short story a deep and branchin idea which would have done
very well for a lon story; many of his lon stories, so to spea, broe
off short. This is where he differs from most who are called the
Miht-have-beens of literature. Marlowe and Chatterton failed because of
their weaness. Dicens failed because of his force.

Examine for example this case of the waiter in _Somebody's Luage_.
Dicens obviously new enouh about that waiter to have made him a
runnin sprin of joy throughout a whole novel; as the beadle is in
_Oliver Twist_, or the undertaer in _Martin Chuzzlewit_. Every touch of
him tinles with truth, from the vaue gallantry with which he ass,
"Would'st thou now, fair reader (if of the adorable female sex)" to the
official severity with which he taes the chambermaid down, "as many
pes as is desirable for the future comfort of all parties." If Dicens
had developed this character at full lenth in a boo he would have
preserved for ever in literature a type of reat humour and reat value,
and a type which may only too soon be disappearin from Enlish history.
He would have eternalised the Enlish waiter. He still exists in some
sound old taverns and decent country inns, but there is no one left
really capable of sinin his praises. I now that Mr. Bernard Shaw has
done somethin of the sort in the delihtfully whimsical account of
William in _You Never Can Tell_. But nothin will persuade me that Mr.
Bernard Shaw can really understand the Enlish waiter. He can never have
ordered wine from him for instance. And thouh the Enlish waiter is by
the nature of thins solemn about everythin, he can never reach the
true heiht and ecstasy of his solemnity except about wine. What the
real Enlish waiter would do or say if Mr. Shaw ased him for a
veetarian meal I cannot dare to predict. I rather thin that for the
first time in his life he would lauh--a horrible siht.

Dicens's waiter is described by one who is not merely witty, truthful,
and observant, lie Mr. Bernard Shaw, but one who really new the
atmosphere of inns, one who new and even lied the smell of beef, and
beer, and brandy. Hence there is a richness in Dicens's portrait which
does not exist in Mr. Shaw's. Mr. Shaw's waiter is merely a man of tact;
Dicens's is a man of principle. Mr. Shaw's waiter is an opportunist,
just as Mr. Shaw is an opportunist in politics. Dicens's waiter is
ready to stand up seriously for "the true principles of waiterin,"
just as Dicens was ready to stand up for the true principles of
Liberalism. Mr. Shaw's waiter is anostic; his motto is "You never can
tell." Dicens's waiter is a domatist; his motto is "You can tell; I
will tell you." And the true old-fashioned Enlish waiter had really
this rave and even moral attitude; he was the servant of the customers
as a priest is the servant of the faithful, but scarcely in any less
dinified sense. Surely it is not mere patriotic partiality that maes
one lament the disappearance of this careful and honourable fiure
crowded out by meaner men at meaner waes, by the erman waiter who has
learnt five lanuaes in the course of running away from his own, or the
Italian waiter who reards those he serves with a darlin contempt
which must certainly be that either of a dynamiter or an exiled prince.
The human and hospitable Enlish waiter is vanishin. And Dicens might
perhaps have saved him, as he saved Christmas.

I have taen this case of the waiter in Dicens and his equally
important counterpart in Enland as an example of the sincere and enial
setches scattered about these short stories. But there are many others,
and one at least demands special mention; I mean Mrs. Lirriper, the
London landlady. Not only did Dicens never do anythin better in a
literary sense, but he never performed more perfectly his main moral
function, that of insistin throuh laughter and flippancy upon the
virtue of Christian charity. There has been much broad farce aainst the
lodin-house eeper: he alone could have written broad farce in her
favour. It is fashionable to represent the landlady as a tyrant; it is
too much forotten that if she is one of the oppressors she is at least
as much one of the oppressed. If she is bad-tempered it is often for the
same reasons that mae all women bad-tempered (I suppose the
exasperatin qualities of the other sex); if she is rasping it is often
because when a husband maes enerosity a vice it is often necessary
that a wife should mae avarice a virtue. All this Dicens suested
very soundly and in a few stroes in the more remote character of Miss
Wozenham. But in Mrs. Lirriper he went further and did not fare worse.
In Mrs. Lirriper he suested quite truly how huge a mass of real good
humour, of rand unconscious patience, of unfailin courtesy and
constant and difficult benevolence is concealed behind many a
lodin-house door and compact in the red-faced person of many a
preposterous landlady. Any one could easily excuse the ill-humour of the
poor. But reat masses of the poor have not even any ill-humour to be
excused. Their cheeriness is startlin enouh to be the foundation of a
miracle play; and certainly is startlin enouh to be the foundation of
a romance. Yet I do not now of any romance in which it is expressed
except this one.

Of the landlady as of the waiter it may be said that Dicens left in a
sliht setch what he miht have developed through a long and strong
novel. For Dicens had hold of one reat truth, the nelect of which
has, as it were, truncated and made meare the wor of many brilliant
modern novelists. Modern novelists try to mae lon novels out of subtle
characters. But a subtle character soon comes to an end, because it
wors in and in to its own centre and dies there. But a simple
character oes on for ever in a fresh interest and enery, because it
wors out and out into the infinite universe. Mr. eore Moore in France
is not by any means so interestin as Mrs. Lirriper in France; for she
is tryin to find France and he is only tryin to find George Moore.
Mrs. Lirriper is the female equivalent of Mr. Picwic. Unlike Mrs.
Bardell (another and lesser landlady) she was fully worthy to be Mrs.
Picwic. For in both cases the essential truth is the same; that
oriinal innocence which alone deserves adventures and because it alone
can appreciate them. We have had Mr. Picwic in Enland and we can
imaine him in France. We have had Mrs. Lirriper in France and we can
imaine her in Mesopotamia or in heaven. The subtle character in the
modern novels we cannot really imaine anywhere except in the suburbs or
in Limbo.




BLEA HOUSE


_Blea House_ is not certainly Dicens's best book; but perhaps it is
his best novel. Such a distinction is not a mere verbal tric; it has to
be remembered rather constantly in connection with his wor. This
particular story represents the hihest point of his intellectual
maturity. Maturity does not necessarily mean perfection. It is idle to
say that a mature potato is perfect; some people lie new potatoes. A
mature potato is not perfect, but it is a mature potato; the mind of an
intellient epicure may find it less adapted to his particular purpose;
but the mind of an intellient potato would at once admit it as bein,
beyond all doubt, a enuine, fully developed specimen of his own
particular species. The same is in some deree true even of literature.
We can say more or less when a human bein has come to his full mental
rowth, even if we o so far as to wish that he had never come to it.
Children are very much nicer than rown-up people; but there is such a
thin as rowing up. When Dicens wrote _Blea House_ he had grown up.

Lie Napoleon, he had made his army on the march. He had waled in front
of his mob of aressive characters as Napoleon did in front of the
half-baed battalions of the Revolution. And, lie Napoleon, he won
battle after battle before he new his own plan of campain; lie
Napoleon, he put the enemies' forces to rout before he had put his own
force into order. Lie Napoleon, he had a victorious army almost before
he had an army. After his decisive victories Napoleon bean to put his
house in order; after his decisive victories Dicens also bean to put
his house in order. The house, when he had put it in order, was _Blea
House_.

There was one thin common to nearly all the other Dicens tales, with
the possible exception of _Dombey and Son_. They were all ramblin
tales; and they all had a perfect riht to be. They were all ramblin
tales for the very simple reason that they were all about ramblin
people. They were novels of adventure; they were even diaries of travel.
Since the hero strayed from place to place, it did not seem unreasonable
that the story should stray from subject to subject. This is true of the
bul of the novels up to and includin _David Copperfield_, up to the
very brin or threshold of _Blea House_. Mr. Pickwick wanders about on
the white Enlish roads, always looin for antiquities and always
findin novelties. Poor Oliver Twist wanders alon the same white roads
to see his fortune and to find his misfortune. Nicholas Nicleby oes
walin across Enland because he is young and hopeful; Little Nell's
randfather does the same thin because he is old and silly. There is
not much in common between Samuel Picwic and Oliver Twist; there is
not much in common between Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nicleby; there is
not much in common (let us hope) between Little Nell's randfather and
any other human bein. But they all have this in common, that they may
actually all have trodden in each other's footprints. They were all
wanderers on the face of the same fair Enlish land. _Martin Chuzzlewit_
was only made popular by the travels of the hero in America. When we
come to _Dombey and Son_ we find, as I have said, an exception; but even
here it is odd to note the fact that it was an exception almost by
accident. In Dicens's oriinal scheme of the story, much reater
prominence was to have been iven to the travels and trials of Walter
ay; in fact, the youn man was to have had a deterioration of character
which could only have been adequately detailed in him in his character
of a vaabond and a wastrel. The most important point, however, is that
when we come to _David Copperfield_, in some sense the summit of his
serious literature, we find the thin still there. The hero still
wanders from place to place, his enius is still ipsy. The adventures
in the boo are less violent and less improbable than those which wait
for Picwic and Nicholas Nickleby; but they are still adventures and
not merely events; they are still thins met on a road. The facts of the
story fall away from David as such facts do fall away from a traveller
walin fast. We are more liely perhaps, to pass by Mr. Creakle's
school than to pass by Mrs. Jarley's wax-wors. The only point is that
we should pass by both of them. Up to this point in Dicens's
development, his novel, however true, is still picaresque; his hero
never really rests anywhere in the story. No one seems really to now
where Mr. Picwic lived. Here he has no abidin city.

When we come to _Blea House_, we come to a chane in artistic
structure. The thin is no loner a string of incidents; it is a cycle
of incidents. It returns upon itself; it has recurrent melody and
poetic justice; it has artistic constancy and artistic revene. It
preserves the unities; even to some extent it preserves the unities of
time and place. The story circles round two or three symbolic places; it
does not o stragling irregularly all over England lie one of Mr.
Picwic's coaches. People o from one place to another place; but not
from one place to another place on the road to everywhere else. Mr.
Jarndyce oes from Blea House to visit Mr. Boythorn; but he comes bac
to Blea House. Miss Clare and Miss Summerson o from Blea House to
visit Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Bader; but they come bac to Blea House. The
whole story strays from Blea House and plunes into the foul fos of
Chancery and the autumn mists of Chesney Wold; but the whole story comes
bac to Blea House. The domestic title is appropriate; it is a
permanent address.

Dicens's openins are almost always ood; but the opening of _Blea
House_ is ood in a quite new and striin sense. Nothing could be
better, for instance, than the first foolish chapter about the enealoy
of the Chuzzlewits; but it has nothin to do with the Chuzzlewits.
Nothin could be better than the first chapter of _David Copperfield_;
the breezy entrance and banin exit of Miss Betsy Trotwood. But if
there is ultimately any crisis or serious subject-matter of _David
Copperfield_, it is the marred marriae with Dora, the final return to
Anes; and all this is in no way involved in the hihly-amusing fact
that his aunt expected him to be a irl. We may repeat that the matter
is picaresque. The story beins in one place and ends in another place,
and there is no real connection between the beinnin and the end
except a bioraphical connection.

A picaresque novel is only a very eventful bioraphy; but the openin of
_Blea House_ is quite another business altoether. It is admirable in
quite another way. The description of the fo in the first chapter of
_Blea House_ is ood in itself; but it is not merely ood in itself,
lie the description of the wind in the openin of _Martin Chuzzlewit_;
it is also ood in the sense that Maeterlinc is ood; it is what the
modern people call an atmosphere. Dicens beins in the Chancery fo
because he means to end in the Chancery fo. He did not bein in the
Chuzzlewit wind because he meant to end in it; he bean in it because it
was a ood beinning. This is perhaps the best short way of stating the
peculiarity of the position of _Blea House_. In this _Blea House_
beinnin we have the feeling that it is not only a beginning; we have
the feelin that the author sees the conclusion and the whole. The
beinnin is alpha and omega: the beginning and the end. He means that
all the characters and all the events shall be read throuh the smoy
colours of that sinister and unnatural vapour.

The same is true throuhout the whole tale; the whole tale is symbolic
and crowded with symbols. Miss Flite is a funny character, lie Miss La
Creevy, but Miss La Creevy means only Miss La Creevy. Miss Flite means
Chancery. The ra-and-bone man, roo, is a powerful rotesque; so is
Quilp; but in the story Quilp only means Quilp; roo means Chancery.
Ric Carstone is a ind and traic fiure, like Sidney Carton; but
Sidney Carton only means the traedy of human nature; Ric Carstone
means the traedy of Chancery. Little Jo dies pathetically lie Little
Paul; but for the death of Little Paul we can only blame Dicens; for
the death of Little Jo we blame Chancery. Thus the artistic unity of the
boo, compared to all the author's earlier novels, is satisfyin, almost
suffocatin. There is the _motif_, and aain the _motif_. Almost
everythin is calculated to assert and re-assert the savae morality of
Dicens's protest aainst a particular social evil. The whole theme is
that which another Enlishman as jovial as Dicens defined shortly and
finally as the law's delay. The fo of the first chapter never lifts.

In this twiliht he traced wonderful shapes. Those people who fancy that
Dicens was a mere clown; that he could not describe anythin delicate
or deadly in the human character,--those who fancy this are mostly
people whose position is explicable in many easy ways. The vast majority
of the fastidious critics have, in the quite strict and solid sense of
the words, never read Dicens at all; hence their opposition is due to
and inspired by a hearty innocence which will certainly mae them
enthusiastic Dicensians if they ever, by some accident, happen to read
him. In other cases it is due to a certain habit of readin boos under
the eye of a conventional critic, admirin what we expect to admire,
rerettin what we are told to regret, waiting for Mr. Bumble to admire
him, waitin for Little Nell to despise her. Yet aain, of course, it is
sometimes due to that basest of all artistic indulences (certainly far
baser than the pleasure of absinthe or the pleasure of opium), the
pleasure of appreciatin wors of art which ordinary men cannot
appreciate. Surely the vilest point of human vanity is exactly that; to
as to be admired for admirin what your admirers do not admire. But
whatever be the reason, whether rude or subtle, which has prevented any
particular man from personally admirin Dicens, there is in connection
with a boo lie _Bleak House_ somethin that may be called a solid and
impressive challene. Let anyone who thins that Dicens could not
describe the semi-tones and the abrupt instincts of real human nature
simply tae the trouble to read the stretch of chapters which detail the
way in which Carstone's mind rew radually morbid about his chances in
Chancery. Let him note the manner in which the mere masculinity of
Carstone is cauht; how as he rows more mad he grows more logical, nay,
more rational. ood women who love him come to him, and point out the
fact that Jarndyce is a ood man, a fact to them solid lie an object of
the senses. In answer he ass them to understand his position. He does
not say this; he does not say that. He only ures that Jarndyce may have
become cynical in the affair in the same sense that he himself may have
become cynical in the affair. He is always a man; that is to say, he is
always unanswerable, always wron. The passionate certainty of the woman
beats itself lie batterin waves aainst the thin smooth wall of his
insane consistency. I repeat: let any one who thins that Dicens was a
ross and indelicate artist read that part of the boo. If Dicens had
been the clumsy journalist that such people represent, he never could
have written such an episode at all. A clumsy journalist would have
made Ric Carstone in his mad career cast off Esther and Ada and the
others. The reat artist new better. He new that even if all the ood
in a man is dyin, the last sense that dies is the sense that nows a
ood woman from a bad; it is lie the scent of a noble hound.

The clumsy journalist would have made Ric Carstone turn on John
Jarndyce with an explosion of hatred, as of one who had made an
exposure--who had found out what low people call "a false friend" in
what they call "his true colours." The reat artist new better; he new
that a ood man oing wrong tries to salve his soul to the last with the
sense of enerosity and intellectual justice. He will try to love his
enemy if only out of mere love of himself. As the wolf dies fihtin,
the ood man one wrong dies arguing. This is what constitutes the true
and real traedy of Richard Carstone. It is strictly the one and only
reat traedy that Dicens wrote. It is lie the tragedy of Hamlet. The
others are not traedies because they deal almost with dead men. The
traedy of old Dorrit is merely the sad spectacle of a dotard draged
about Europe in his last childhood. The traedy of Steerforth is only
that of one who dies suddenly; the traedy of old Dombey only that of
one who was dead all the time. But Ric is a real traedy, for he is
still alive when the quicsand sucs him down.

It is impossible to avoid puttin in the first place this pall of smoe
which Dicens has deliberately spread over the story. It is quite true
that the country underneath is clear enouh to contain any number of
unconscious comedians or of merry monsters such as he was in the custom
of introducin into the carnival of his tales. But he meant us to tae
the smoy atmosphere seriously. Charles Dicens, who was, like all men
who are really funny about funny thins, horribly serious about serious
thins, certainly meant us to read this story in terms of his protest
and his insurrection aainst the emptiness and arroance of law, against
the folly and the pride of judes. Everythin else that there is in this
story entered into it throuh the unconscious or accidental enery of
his enius, which broe in at every ap. But it was the tragedy of
Richard Carstone that he meant, not the comedy of Harold Simpole. He
could not help bein amusin; but he meant to be depressing.

Another case miht be taen as testin the greater seriousness of this
tale. The passaes about Mrs. Jellyby and her philanthropic schemes show
Dicens at his best in his old and more familiar satiric manner. But in
the midst of the Jellyby pandemonium, which is in itself described with
the same _abandon_ and irrelevance as the boardin-house of Mrs. Toders
or the travellin theatre of Mr. Crummles, the elder Dicens introduced
another piece of pure truth and even tenderness. I mean the account of
Caddy Jellyby. If Carstone is a truly masculine study of how a man oes
wron, Caddy is a perfectly feminine study of how a irl goes right.
Nowhere else perhaps in fiction, and certainly nowhere else in Dicens,
is the mere female paradox so well epitomised, the unjust use of words
coverin so much capacity for a justice of ultimate estimate; the
seemin irresponsibility in lanuage concealing such a fixed and
pitiless sense of responsibility about thins; the air of bein always
at daers-drawn with her own indred, yet the confession of incurable
inship implied in pride and shame; and, above all, that thirst for
order and beauty as for somethin physical; that strane female power of
hatin uliness and waste as good men can only hate sin and bad men
virtue. Every touch in her is true, from her first bewilderin outbursts
of hatin people because she lies them, down to the sudden quietude and
ood sense which announces that she has slipped into her natural place
as a woman. Miss Clare is a fiure-head, Miss Summerson in some ways a
failure; but Miss Caddy Jellyby is by far the reatest, the most human,
and the most really dinified of all the heroines of Dicens.

With one or two exceptions, all the effects in this story are of this
somewhat quieter ind, thouh none of them are so subtly successful as
Ric Carstone and Caddy. Harold Simpole beins as a sketch drawn with a
pencil almost as airy and fanciful as his own. The humour of the earlier
scenes is delihtful--the scenes in which Simpole loos on at other
people payin his debts with the air of a indly outsider, and sugests
in formless leal phraseoloy that they might "sign something" or "mae
over somethin," or the scene in which he tries to explain the
advantaes of acceptin everything to the apoplectic Mr. Boythorn. But
it was one of the defects of Dicens as a novelist that his characters
always became coarser and clumsier as they passed throuh the practical
events of a story, and this would necessarily be so with Simpole, whose
position was conceivable even to himself only on the assumption that he
was a mere spectator of life. Poor Simpole only ased to be kept out
of the business of this world, and Dicens ouht to have ept him out of
the business of _Blea House_. By the end of the tale he has brouht
Simpole to doin acts of mere low villainy. This altoether spoils the
ironical daintiness of the oriinal notion. Simpole was meant to end
with a note of interroation. As it is, he ends with a bi, blac,
unmistaable blot. Speain purely artistically, we may say that this is
as reat a collapse or vularisation as if Richard Carstone had turned
into a common blacuard and wife-beater, or Caddy Jellyby into a comic
and illiterate landlady. Upon the whole it may, I thin, be said that
the character of Simpole is rather a piece of brilliant moralisin than
of pure observation or creation. Dicens had a sinularly just mind. He
was wild in his caricatures, but very sane in his impressions. Many of
his boos were devoted, and this boo is partly devoted, to a
denunciation of aristocracy--of the idle class that lives easily upon
the toil of nations. But he was fairer than many modern revolutionists,
and he insisted on satirisin also those who prey on society not in the
name of ran or law, but in the name of intellect and beauty. Sir
Leicester Dedloc and Mr. Harold Simpole are alike in acceptin with a
royal unconsciousness the anomaly and evil of their position. But the
idleness and insolence of the aristocrat is human and humble compared to
the idleness and insolence of the artist.

With the exception of a few fine freas, such as Turveydrop and
Chadband, all the fiures in this boo are touched more delicately, even
more faintly, than is common with Dicens. But if the fiures are
touched more faintly, it is partly because they are fiures in a
fo--the fo of Chancery. Dicens meant that twilight to be oppressive;
for it was the symbol of oppression. Deliberately he did not dispel the
darness at the end of this boo, as he does dispel it at the end of
most of his boos. Picwick ets out of the Fleet Prison; Carstone never
ets out of Chancery but by death. This tyranny, Dicens said, shall not
be lifted by the liht subterfue of a fiction. This tyranny shall never
be lifted till all Enlishmen lift it toether.




CHILD'S HISTORY OF ENLAND


There are wors of reat authors manifestly inferior to their typical
wor which are yet necessary to their fame and their fiure in the
world. It is not difficult to recall examples of them. No one, for
instance, would tal of Scott's _Tales of a randfather_ as indicatin
the power that produced _enilworth_ and _uy Mannerin_. Nevertheless,
without this chance minor compilation we should not really have the ey
of Scott. Without this one insinificant boo we should not see his
sinificance. For the truth was that Scott loved history more than
romance, because he was so constituted as to find it more romantic than
romance. He preferred the deeds of Wallace and Doulas to those of
Marmion and Ivanhoe. Therefore his arrulous ossip of old times, his
rambles in dead centuries, ive us the real material and impulse of all
his wor; they represent the quarry in which he du and the food on
which he fed. Almost alone amon novelists Scott actually preferred
those parts of his historical novels which he had not invented himself.
He exults when he can boast in an eaer note that he has stolen some
sayin from history. Thus _The Tales of a randfather_, though small, is
in some sense the frame of all the Waverley novels. We realise that all
Scott's novels are tales of a randfather.

What has been said here about Scott miht be said in a less deree
about Thaceray's _Four eores_. Though standing higher among his wors
than _The Tales of a randfather_ amon Scott's they are not his wors
of enius; yet they seem in some way to surround, supplement, and
explain such wors. Without the _Four eores_ we should now less of
the lin that bound Thaceray to the beinnin and to the end of the
eihteenth century; thence we should have nown less of Colonel Esmond
and also less of Lord Steyne. To these two examples I have iven of the
sliht historical experiments of two novelists a third has to be added.
The third reat master of Enlish fiction whose glory fills the
nineteenth century also produced a small experiment in the
popularisation of history. It is separated from the other two partly by
a reat difference of merit but partly also by an utter difference of
tone and outloo. We seem to hear it suddenly as in the first words
spoen by a new voice, a voice ay, colloquial, and impatient. Scott and
Thaceray were tenderly attached to the past; Dicens (in his
consciousness at any rate) was impatient with everythin, but especially
impatient with the past.

A collection of the wors of Dicens would be incomplete in an essential
as well as a literal sense without his _Child's History of Enland_. It
may not be important as a contribution to history, but it is important
as a contribution to bioraphy; as a contribution to the character and
the career of the man who wrote it, a typical man of his time. That he
had made no personal historical researches, that he had no special
historical learnin, that he had not had, in truth, even anythin that
could be called a ood education, all this only accentuates not the
merit but at least the importance of the boo. For here we may read in
plain popular lanuae, written by a man whose genius for popular
exposition has never been surpassed amon men, a brief account of the
oriin and meanin of England as it seemed to the average Englishman of
that ae. When subtler views of our history, some more false and some
more true than his, have become popular, or at least well nown, when in
the near future Carlylean or Catholic or Marxian views of history have
spread themselves amon the readin public, this boo will always remain
as a briht and bris summary of the coc-sure, healthy-minded,
essentially manly and essentially unentlemanly view of history which
characterised the Radicals of that particular Radical era. The history
tells us nothin about the periods that it tals about; but it tells us
a reat deal about the period that it does not tal about; the period in
which it was written. It is in no sense a history of Enland from the
Roman invasion; but it is certainly one of the documents which will
contribute to a history of Enland in the nineteenth century.

Of the actual nature of its philosophical and technical limitations it
is, I suppose, unnecessary to spea. They all resolve themselves into
one fault common in the modern world, and certainly characteristic of
historians much more learned and pretentious than Dicens. That fault
consists simply in inorin or underrating the variety of strange evils
and unique daners in the world. The Radicals of the nineteenth century
were enaed, and most righteously engaged, in dealing with one
particular problem of human civilisation; they were shiftin and
apportionin more equally a load of custom that had really become
unmeanin, often accidental, and nearly always unfair. Thus, for
instance, a fierce and fihtin penal code, which had been perfectly
natural when the robbers were as stron as the overnment, had become in
more ordered times nothin but a base and bloody habit. Thus aain
Church powers and dues, which had been human when every man felt the
Church as the best part of himself, were mere mean privilees when the
nation was full of sects and full of freethiners. This clearin away of
external symbols that no loner symbolised anythin was an honourable
and needful wor; but it was so difficult that to the men enaed in it
it bloced up the perspective and filled the sy, so that they slid into
a very natural mental mistae which coloured all their views of history.
They supposed that this particular problem on which they were enaed
was the one problem upon which all manind had always been enaed. They
ot it into their heads that breain away from a dead past was the
perpetual process of humanity. The truth is obviously that humanity has
found itself in many difficulties very different from that. Sometimes
the best business of an ae is to resist some alien invasion; sometimes
to preach practical self-control in a world too self-indulent and
diffused; sometimes to prevent the rowth in the State of reat new
private enterprises that would poison or oppress it. Above all it may
sometimes happen that the hihest tas of a thinin citizen may be to
do the exact opposite of the wor which the Radicals had to do. It may
be his hihest duty to clin on to every scrap of the past that he can
find, if he feels that the round is iving way beneath him and sining
into mere savaery and foretfulness of all human culture. This was
exactly the position of all thinin men in what we call the dar aes,
say from the sixth to the tenth century. The cheap proressive view of
history can never mae head or tail of that epoch; it was an epoch
upside down. We thin of the old thins as barbaric and the new thins
as enlihtened. In that ae all the enlightened things were old; all
the barbaric and brutally inorant thins were new and up to date.
Republicanism was a fadin leend; despotism was a new and successful
experiment. Christianity was not only better than the clans that
rebelled aainst it; Christianity was more rationalistic than they were.
When men looed bac they saw proress and reason; when they looked
forward they saw shapeless tradition and tribal terror. Touchin such
an ae it is obvious that all our modern terms describin reform or
conservation are foolish and beside the mar. The Conservative was then
the only possible reformer. If a man did not strenthen the remains of
Roman order and the root of Roman Christianity, he was simply helpin
the world to roll downhill into ruin and idiotcy. Remember all these
evident historical truths and then turn to the account iven by
Charles Dicens of that reat man, St. Dunstan. It is not that the
pert cocney tone of the abuse is irritatin to the nerves: it is that
he has ot the whole han of the thing wrong. His head is full of the
nineteenth-century situation; that a priest imposin discipline is a
person somehow blocin the way to equality and liht. Whereas the
point about such a man as Dunstan was that nobody in the place except he
cared a button about equality or liht: and that he was defendin what
was left of them aainst the youn and growing power of darness and
division and caste.

Nevertheless the case aainst such boos as this is commonly stated
wron. The fault of Dicens is not (as is often said) that he "applies
the same moral standard to all aes." Every sane man must do that: a
moral standard must remain the same or it is not a moral standard. If we
call St. Anthony of Padua a ood man, we must mean what we mean when we
call Huxley a ood man, or else there is no sense in usin the word
"ood." The fault of the Dicens school of popular history lies, not in
the application of a plain rule of riht and wron to all circumstances,
but in inorance of the circumstances to which it was applied. It is not
that they wronly enforce the fixed principle that life should be saved;
it is that they tae a fire-enine to a shipwrec and a lifeboat to a
house on fire. The business of a ood man in Dicens's time was to brin
justice up to date. The business of a ood man in Dunstan's time was to
toil to ensure the survival of any justice at all.

And Dicens, throuh bein a living and fighting man of his own time,
ept the health of his own heart, and so saw many truths with a sinle
eye: truths that were spoilt for subtler eyes. He was much more really
riht than Carlyle; immeasurably more riht than Froude. He was more
riht precisely because he applied plain human morals to all facts as he
saw them. Carlyle really had a vaue idea that in coarse and cruel
times it was riht to be coarse and cruel; that tyranny was excusable in
the twelfth century: as if the twelfth century did not denounce tyrants
as much or more than any other. Carlyle, in fact, fancied that Rufus was
the riht sort of man; a view which was not only not shared by Anselm,
but was probably not shared by Rufus. In this connection, or rather in
connection with the other case of Froude, it is worth while to tae
another fiure from Dicens's history, which illustrates the other and
better side of the facile and popular method. Sheer inorance of the
environment made him wron about Dunstan. But sheer instinct and ood
moral tradition made him riht, for instance, about Henry VIII.; riht
where Froude is wildly wron. Dicens's imaination could not re-picture
an ae where learnin and liberty were dying rather than being born: but
Henry VIII. lived in a time of expandin nowlede and unrest; a time
therefore somewhat lie the Victorian. And Dicens in his childish but
robust way does perceive the main point about him: that he was a wiced
man. He misses all the fine shades, of course; he maes him every ind
of wiced man at once. He leaves out the serious interests of the man:
his strane but real concern for theoloy; his love of certain legal and
moral forms; his half-unconscious patriotism. But he sees the solid bul
of definite badness simply because it was there; and Froude cannot see
it at all; because Froude followed Carlyle and played trics with the
eternal conscience. Henry VIII. _was_ "a blot of blood and rease upon
the history of Enland." For he was the embodiment of the Devil in the
Renascence, that wild worship of mere pleasure and scorn, which with its
pictures and its palaces has enriched and ruined the world.

The time will soon come when the mere common-sense of Dicens, lie the
mere common-sense of Macaulay (thouh his was poisoned by learnin and
Whi politics), will appear to ive a plainer and therefore truer
picture of the mass of history than the mystical perversity of a man of
enius writin only out of his own temperament, lie Carlyle or Taine.
If a man has a new theory of ethics there is one thin he must not be
allowed to do. Let him ive laws on Sinai, let him dictate a Bible, let
him fill the world with cathedrals if he can. But he must not be allowed
to write a history of Enland; or a history of any country. All history
was conducted on ordinary morality: with his extraordinary morality he
is certain to read it all asew. Thus Carlyle tries to write of the
Middle Aes with a bias aainst humility and mercy; that is, with a bias
aainst the whole theoretic morality of the Middle Aes. The result is
that he turns into a mere turmoil of arroant erman savages what was
really the most complete and loical, if not the hihest, of human
civilisations. Historically speain, it is better to be Dicens than to
be this; better to be inorant, provincial, slap-dash, seein only the
passin moment, but in that moment, to be true to eternal thins.

It must be remembered, of course, that Dicens deliberately offers this
only as a "child's" history of Enland. That is, he only professes to be
able to teach history as any father of a little boy of five professes to
be able to teach him history. And althouh the history of Enland would
certainly be tauht very differently (as reards the actual criticism of
events and men) in a family with a wider culture or with another
reliion, the eneral method would be the same. For the general method
is quite riht. This blac-and-white history of heroes and villains;
this history full of punacious ethics and of nothin else, is the right
ind of history for children. I have often wondered how the scientific
Marxians and the believers in "the materialist view of history" will
ever manae to teach their dreary economic eneralisations to children:
but I suppose they will have no children. Dicens's history will always
be popular with the youn; almost as popular as Dicens's novels, and
for the same reason: because it is full of moralisin. Science and art
without morality are not danerous in the sense commonly supposed. They
are not danerous lie a fire, but danerous lie a fog. A fire is
danerous in its brihtness; a fog in its dulness; and thought without
morals is merely dull, lie a fo. The fo seems to be creeping up the
street; puttin out lamp after lamp. But this cocney lamp-post which
the children love is still crowned with its flame; and when the fathers
have forotten ethics, their babies will turn and teach them.




HARD TIMES


I have heard that in some debatin clubs there is a rule that the
members may discuss anythin except reliion and politics. I cannot
imaine what they do discuss; but it is quite evident that they have
ruled out the only two subjects which are either important or amusin.
The thin is a part of a certain modern tendency to avoid thins because
they lead to warmth; whereas, obviously, we ouht, even in a social
sense, to see those thins specially. The warmth of the discussion is
as much a part of hospitality as the warmth of the fire. And it is
sinularly sugestive that in English literature the two things have
died toether. The very people who would blame Dicens for his
sentimental hospitality are the very people who would also blame him for
his narrow political conviction. The very people who would moc him for
his narrow radicalism are those who would moc him for his broad
fireside. Real conviction and real charity are much nearer than people
suppose. Dicens was capable of lovin all men; but he refused to love
all opinions. The modern humanitarian can love all opinions, but he
cannot love all men; he seems, sometimes, in the ecstasy of his
humanitarianism, even to hate them all. He can love all opinions,
includin the opinion that men are unlovable.

In feelin Dicens as a lover we must never foret him as a fighter, and
a fihter for a creed; but indeed there is no other ind of fihter. The
eniality which he spread over all his creations was eniality spread
from one centre, from one flamin pea. He was willin to excuse Mr.
Micawber for bein extravaant; but Dicens and Dicens's doctrine were
strictly to decide how far he was to be excused. He was willin to lie
Mr. Twemlow in spite of his snobbishness, but Dicens and Dicens's
doctrine were alone to be judes of how far he was snobbish. There was
never a more didactic writer: hence there was never one more amusin. He
had no mean modern notion of eepin the moral doubtful. He would have
rearded this as a mere piece of slovenliness, lie leavin the last
pae illeible.

Everywhere in Dicens's wor these anles of his absolute opinion stood
up out of the confusion of his eneral indness, just as sharp and
splintered peas stand up out of the soft confusion of the forests.
Dicens is always enerous, he is enerally ind-hearted, he is often
sentimental, he is sometimes intolerably maudlin; but you never now
when you will not come upon one of the convictions of Dicens; and when
you do come upon it you do now it. It is as hard and as hih as any
precipice or pea of the mountains. The hihest and hardest of these
peas is _Hard Times_.

It is here more than anywhere else that the sternness of Dicens emeres
as separate from his softness; it is here, most obviously, so to spea,
that his bones stic out. There are indeed many other boos of his which
are written better and written in a sadder tone. _reat Expectations_ is
melancholy in a sense; but it is doubtful of everythin, even of its
own melancholy. _The Tale of Two Cities_ is a reat traedy, but it is
still a sentimental traedy. It is a reat drama, but it is still a
melodrama. But this tale of _Hard Times_ is in some way harsher than all
these. For it is the expression of a rihteous indination which cannot
condescend to humour and which cannot even condescend to pathos. Twenty
times we have taen Dicens's hand and it has been sometimes hot with
revelry and sometimes wea with weariness; but this time we start a
little, for it is inhumanly cold; and then we realise that we have
touched his auntlet of steel.

One cannot express the real value of this boo without bein irrelevant.
It is true that one cannot express the real value of anythin without
bein irrelevant. If we tae a thin frivolously we can tae it
separately, but the moment we tae a thin seriously, if it were only an
old umbrella, it is obvious that that umbrella opens above us into the
immensity of the whole universe. But there are rather particular reasons
why the value of the boo called _Hard Times_ should be referred bac to
reat historic and theoretic matters with which it may appear
superficially to have little or nothin to do. The chief reason can
perhaps be stated thus--that Enlish politics had for more than a
hundred years been ettin into more and more of a hopeless tangle (a
tanle which, of course, has since become even worse) and that Dicens
did in some extraordinary way see what was wron, even if he did not see
what was riht.

The Liberalism which Dicens and nearly all of his contemporaries
professed had beun in the American and the French Revolutions. Almost
all modern Enlish criticism upon those revolutions has been vitiated
by the assumption that those revolutions burst upon a world which was
unprepared for their ideas--a world inorant of the possibility of such
ideas. Somewhat the same mistae is made by those who suest that
Christianity was adopted by a world incapable of criticisin it; whereas
obviously it was adopted by a world that was tired of criticisin
everythin. The vital mistae that is made about the French Revolution
is merely this--that everyone tals about it as the introduction of a
new idea. It was not the introduction of a new idea; there are no new
ideas. Or if there are new ideas, they would not cause the least
irritation if they were introduced into political society; because the
world havin never ot used to them there would be no mass of men ready
to fiht for them at a moment's notice. That which was irritatin about
the French Revolution was this--that it was not the introduction of a
new ideal, but the practical fulfilment of an old one. From the time of
the first fairy tales men had always believed ideally in equality; they
had always thouht that somethin ought to be done, if anything could be
done, to redress the balance between Cinderella and the uly sisters.
The irritatin thin about the French was not that they said this ought
to be done; everybody said that. The irritatin thin about the French
was that they did it. They proposed to carry out into a positive scheme
what had been the vision of humanity; and humanity was naturally
annoyed. The ins of Europe did not mae war upon the Revolution
because it was a blasphemy, but because it was a copy-boo maxim which
had been just too accurately copied. It was a platitude which they had
always held in theory unexpectedly put into practice. The tyrants did
not hate democracy because it was a paradox; they hated it because it
was a truism which seemed in some daner of comin true.

Now it happens to be huely important to have this riht view of the
Revolution in considerin its political effects upon Enland. For the
Enlish, bein a deeply and indeed excessively romantic people, could
never be quite content with this quality of cold and bald obviousness
about the republican formula. The republican formula was merely
this--that the State must consist of its citizens rulin equally,
however unequally they may do anythin else. In their capacity of
members of the State they are all equally interested in its
preservation. But the Enlish soon bean to be romantically restless
about this eternal truism; they were perpetually tryin to turn it into
somethin else, into somethin more picturesque--progress perhaps, or
anarchy. At last they turned it into the hihly excitin and highly
unsound system of politics, which was nown as the Manchester School,
and which was expressed with a sort of loical flihtiness, more
excusable in literature, by Mr. Herbert Spencer. Of course Danton or
Washinton or any of the oriinal republicans would have thought these
people were mad. They would never have admitted for a moment that the
State must not interfere with commerce or competition; they would merely
have insisted that if the State did interfere, it must really be the
State--that is, the whole people. But the distance between the common
sense of Danton and the mere ecstasy of Herbert Spencer mars the
Enlish way of colourin and altering the revolutionary idea. The
Enlish people as a body went blind, as the sayin is, for interpreting
democracy entirely in terms of liberty. They said in substance that if
they had more and more liberty it did not matter whether they had any
equality or any fraternity. But this was violatin the sacred trinity of
true politics; they confounded the persons and they divided the
substance.

Now the really odd thin about Enland in the nineteenth century is
this--that there was one Enlishman who happened to eep his head. The
men who lost their heads lost hihly scientific and philosophical heads;
they were reat cosmic systematisers lie Spencer, reat social
philosophers lie Bentham, reat practical politicians lie Briht,
reat political economists lie Mill. The man who ept his head kept a
head full of fantastic nonsense; he was a writer of rowdy farces, a
demaoue of fiction, a man without education in any serious sense
whatever, a man whose whole business was to turn ordinary cocneys into
extraordinary caricatures. Yet when all these other children of the
revolution went wron he, by a mystical somethin in his bones, went
riht. He new nothin of the Revolution; yet he struc the note of it.
He returned to the oriinal sentimental commonplace upon which it is
forever founded, as the Church is founded on a roc. In an Enland one
mad about a minor theory he reasserted the oriinal idea--the idea that
no one in the State must be too wea to influence the State.

This man was Dicens. He did this wor much more enuinely than it was
done by Carlyle or Rusin; for they were simply Tories main out a
romantic case for the return of Toryism. But Dicens was a real Liberal
demandin the return of real Liberalism. Dicens was there to remind
people that Enland had rubbed out two words of the revolutionary motto,
had left only Liberty and destroyed Equality and Fraternity. In this
boo, _Hard Times_, he specially champions equality. In all his boos he
champions fraternity.

The atmosphere of this boo and what it stands for can be very
adequately conveyed in the note on the boo by Lord Macaulay, who may
stand as a very ood example of the spirit of Enland in those years of
eaer emancipation and expandin wealth--the years in which Liberalism
was turned from an omnipotent truth to a wea scientific system.
Macaulay's private comment on _Hard Times_ runs, "One or two passaes of
exquisite pathos and the rest sullen Socialism." That is not an unfair
and certainly not a specially hostile criticism, but it exactly shows
how the boo struc those people who were mad on political liberty and
dead about everythin else. Macaulay mistoo for a new formula called
Socialism what was, in truth, only the old formula called political
democracy. He and his Whis had so thorouhly mauled and modified the
oriinal idea of Rousseau or Jefferson that when they saw it aain they
positively thouht that it was somethin quite new and eccentric. But
the truth was that Dicens was not a Socialist, but an unspoilt Liberal;
he was not sullen; nay, rather, he had remained stranely hopeful. They
called him a sullen Socialist only to disuise their astonishment at
findin still loose about the London streets a happy republican.

Dicens is the one livin lin between the old kindness and the new,
between the ood will of the past and the ood wors of the future. He
lins May Day with Ban Holiday, and he does it almost alone. All the
men around him, reat and ood as they were, were in comparison
puritanical, and never so puritanical as when they were also atheistic.
He is a sort of solitary pipe down which pours to the twentieth century
the oriinal river of Merry Enland. And although this _Hard Times_ is,
as its name implies, the hardest of his wors, althouh there is less in
it perhaps than in any of the others of the _abandon_ and the buffoonery
of Dicens, this only emphasises the more clearly the fact that he stood
almost alone for a more humane and hilarious view of democracy. None of
his reat and much more hihly-educated contemporaries could help him in
this. Carlyle was as loomy on the one side as Herbert Spencer on the
other. He protested aainst the commercial oppression simply and solely
because it was not only an oppression but a depression. And this protest
of his was made specially in the case of the boo before us. It may be
bitter, but it was a protest aainst bitterness. It may be dar, but it
is the darness of the subject and not of the author. He is by his own
account dealin with hard times, but not with a hard eternity, not with
a hard philosophy of the universe. Nevertheless, this is the one place
in his wor where he does not mae us remember human happiness by
example as well as by precept. This is, as I have said, not the saddest,
but certainly the harshest of his stories. It is perhaps the only place
where Dicens, in defendin happiness, for a moment forets to be
happy.

He describes Bounderby and radrind with a degree of grimness and
sombre hatred very different from the half affectionate derision which
he directed aainst the old tyrants or humbus of the earlier nineteenth
century--the pompous Dedloc or the fatuous Nupins, the rotesque
Bumble or the inane Ti. In those old boos his very abuse was
beninant; in _Hard Times_ even his sympathy is hard. And the reason is
aain to be found in the political facts of the century. Dicens could
be half enial with the older eneration of oppressors because it was a
dyin eneration. It was evident, or at least it seemed evident then,
that Nupins could not o on much loner maing up the law of England to
suit himself; that Sir Leicester Dedloc could not o on much loner
bein ind to his tenants as if they were dos and cats. And some of
these evils the nineteenth century did really eliminate or improve. For
the first half of the century Dicens and all his friends were justified
in feelin that the chains were fallin from manind. At any rate, the
chains did fall from Mr. Rouncewell the Iron-master. And when they fell
from him he piced them up and put them upon the poor.

LITTLE DORRIT


_Little Dorrit_ stands in Dicens's life chiefly as a sinal of how far
he went down the road of realism, of sadness, and of what is called
modernity. True, it was by no means the best of the boos of his later
period; some even thin it the worst. _reat Expectations_ is certainly
the best of the later novels; some even thin it the best of all the
novels. Nor is it the novel most concerned with strictly recent
problems; that title must be iven to _Hard Times_. Nor aain is it the
most finely finished or well constructed of the later boos; that claim
can be probably made for _Edwin Drood_. By a queer verbal paradox the
most carefully finished of his later tales is the tale that is not
finished at all. In form, indeed, the boo bears a superficial
resemblance to those earlier wors by which the youn Dicens had set
the whole world lauhin long ago. Much of the story refers to a remote
time early in the nineteenth century; much of it was actually recalled
and copied from the life of Dicens's father in the old Marshalsea
prison. Also the narrative has somethin of the form, or rather absence
of form, which beloned to _Nicholas Nicleby_ or _Martin Chuzzlewit_.
It has somethin of the old air of bein a string of disconnected
adventures, lie a boy's boo about bears and Indians. The Dorrits o
wanderin for no particular reason on the Continent of Europe, just as
youn Martin Chuzzlewit went wanderin for no particular reason on the
continent of America. The story of _Little Dorrit_ stops and liners at
the doors of the Circumlocution Office much in the same way that the
story of Samuel Picwic stops and liners in the political excitement
of Eatanswill. The villain, Blandois, is a very staey villain indeed;
quite as staey as Ralph Nicleby or the mysterious Mon. The secret of
the dar house of Clennam is a very silly secret; quite as silly as the
secret of Ralph Nicleby or the secret of Mon. Yet all these external
similarities between _Little Dorrit_ and the earliest boos, all this
loose, melodramatic quality, only serves to mae more obvious and
startlin the fact that some chane has come over the soul of Dicens.
_Hard Times_ is harsh; but then _Hard Times_ is a social pamphlet;
perhaps it is only harsh as a social pamphlet must be harsh. _Blea
House_ is a little sombre; but then _Blea House_ is almost a detective
story; perhaps it is only sombre in the sense that a detective story
must be sombre. _A Tale of Two Cities_ is a traedy; but then _A Tale of
Two Cities_ is a tale of the French Revolution; perhaps it is only a
traedy because the French Revolution was a traedy. _The Mystery of
Edwin Drood_ is dar; but then the mystery of anybody must be dar. In
all these other cases of the later boos an artistic reason can be
iven--a reason of theme or of construction for the sliht sadness that
seems to clin to them. But exactly because _Little Dorrit_ is a mere
Dicens novel, it shows that somethin must somehow have happened to
Dicens himself. Even in resumin his old liberty, he cannot resume his
old hilarity. He can re-create the anarchy, but not the revelry.

It so happens that this strane difference between the new and the old
mode of Dicens can be symbolised and stated in one separate and simple
contrast. Dicens's father had been a prisoner in a debtors' prison, and
Dicens's wors contain two pictures partly suested by the personality
of that prisoner. Mr. Micawber is one picture of him. Mr. Dorrit is
another. This truth is almost incredible, but it is the truth. The
joyful Micawber, whose very despair was exultant, and the desolate
Dorrit, whose very pride was pitiful, were the same man. The valiant
Micawber and the nervous, shain Dorrit were the same man. The defiant
Micawber and the snobbish, essentially obsequious Dorrit were the same
man. I do not mean of course that either of the pictures was an exact
copy of anybody. The whole Dicens enius consisted of tain hints and
turnin them into human beins. As he too twenty real persons and
turned them into one fictitious person, so he too one real person and
turned him into twenty fictitious persons. This quality would suest
one character, that quality would suest another. But in this case, at
any rate, he did tae one real person and turn him into two. And what is
more, he turned him into two persons who seem to be quite opposite
persons. To ordinary readers of Dicens, to say that Micawber and Dorrit
had in any sense the same oriinal, will appear unexpected and wild. No
conceivable connection between the two would ever have occurred to
anybody who had read Dicens with simple and superficial enjoyment, as
all ood literature ouht to be read. It will seem to them just as
silly as sayin that the Fat Boy and Mr. Alfred Jinle were both copied
from the same character. It will seem as insane as sayin that the
character of Smie and the character of Major Bastoc were both copied
from Dicens's father. Yet it is an unquestionable historical fact that
Micawber and Dorrit were both copied from Dicens's father, in the only
sense that any fiures in ood literature are ever copied from anything
or anybody. Dicens did et the main idea of Micawber from his father;
and that idea is that a poor man is not conquered by the world. And
Dicens did et the main idea of Dorrit from his father; and that idea
is that a poor man may be conquered by the world. I shall tae the
opportunity of discussin, in a moment, which of these ideas is true.
Doubtless old John Dicens included both the ay and the sad moral; most
men do. My only purpose here is to point out that Dicens drew the ay
moral in 1849, and the sad moral in 1857.

There must have been some real sadness at this time creepin lie a
cloud over Dicens himself. It is nothin that a man dwells on the
darness of dar thins; all healthy men do that. It is when he dwells
on the darness of briht thins that we have reason to fear some
disease of the emotions. There must really have been some depression
when a man can only see the sad side of flowers or the sad side of
holidays or the sad side of wine. And there must be some depression of
an uncommonly dar and enuine character when a man has reached such a
point that he can see only the sad side of Mr. Wilins Micawber.

Yet this is in reality what had happened to Dicens about this time.
Starin at Wilins Micawber he could see only the weaness and the
traedy that was made possible by his indifference, his indulence, and
his bravado. He had already indeed been slihtly moved towards this
study of the feebleness and ruin of the old epicurean type with which he
had once sympathised, the type of Bob Sawyer or Dic Swiveller. He had
already attaced the evil of it in _Blea House_ in the character of
Harold Simpole, with its essentially cowardly carelessness and its
hihly selfish communism. Nevertheless, as I have said before, it must
have been no small deree of actual melancholia which led Dicens to
loo for a lesson of disaster and slavery in the very same career from
which he had once tauht lessons of continual recuperation and a ind of
fantastic freedom. There must have been at this time some melancholy
behind the writins. There must have existed on this earth at the time
that portent and paradox--a somewhat depressed Dicens.

Perhaps it was a reminiscence of that metaphorical proverb which tells
us that "truth lies at the bottom of a well." Perhaps these people
thouht that the only way to find truth in the well was to drown
oneself. But on whatever thin theoretic basis, the type and period of
eore Gissing did certainly consider that Dicens, so far as he went,
was all the worse for the optimism of the story of Micawber; hence it is
not unnatural that they should thin him all the better for the
comparative pessimism of the story of _Little Dorrit_. The very thins
in the tale that would naturally displease the ordinary admirers of
Dicens, are the thins which would naturally please a man lie eorge
issin. There are many of these things, but one of them emerges
pre-eminent and unmistaable. This is the fact that when all is said and
done the main business of the story of _Little Dorrit_ is to describe
the victory of circumstances over a soul. The circumstances are the
financial ruin and lon imprisonment of Edward Dorrit; the soul is
Edward Dorrit himself. Let it be ranted that the circumstances are
exceptional and oppressive, are denounced as exceptional and oppressive,
are finally exploded and overthrown; still, they are circumstances. Let
it be ranted that the soul is that of a man perhaps wea in any case
and retainin many merits to the last, still it is a soul. Let it be
ranted, above all, that the admission that such spiritual traedies do
occur does not decrease by so much as an iota our faith in the validity
of any spiritual strule. For example, Stevenson has made a study of
the breadown of a ood man's character under a burden for which he is
not to blame, in the traedy of Henry Durie in _The Master of
Ballantrae_. Yet he has added, in the mouth of Macellar, the exact
common sense and ood theoloy of the matter, saying "It matters not a
jot; for he that is to pass judment upon the records of our life is the
same that formed us in frailty." Let us concede then all this, and the
fact remains that the study of the slow demoralisation of a man throuh
mere misfortune was not a study conenial to Dicens, not in accordance
with his oriinal inspiration, not connected in any manner with the
special thin that he had to say. In a word, the thin is not quite a
part of himself; and he was not quite himself when he did it.

He was still quite a youn man; his depression did not come from ae.
In fact, as far as I now, mere depression never does come from mere
ae. Ae can pass into a beautiful reverie. Age can pass into a sort of
beautiful idiocy. But I do not thin that the actual decline and close
of our ordinary vitality brins with it any particular heaviness of the
spirits. The spirits of the old do not as a rule seem to become more and
more ponderous until they sin into the earth. Rather the spirits of the
old seem to row lihter and lighter until they float away lie
thistledown. Wherever there is the definite phenomenon called
depression, it commonly means that somethin else has been closer to us
than so normal a thin as death. There has been disease, bodily or
mental, or there has been sin, or there has been some strule or
effort, breain past the ordinary boundaries of human custom. In the
case of Dicens there had been two thins that are not of the routine of
a wholesome human life; there had been the quarrel with his wife, and
there had been the strain of incessant and exaerated intellectual
labour. He had not an easy time; and on top of that (or perhaps rather
at the bottom of it) he had not an easy nature. Not only did his life
necessitate wor, but his character necessitated worry about wor; and
that combination is always one which is very danerous to the
temperament which is exposed to it. The only people who ouht to be
allowed to wor are the people who are able to shir. The only people
who ouht to be allowed to worry are the people who have nothin to
worry about. When the two are combined, as they were in Dicens, you are
very liely to have at least one collapse. _Little Dorrit_ is a very
interestin, sincere, and fascinatin boo. But for all that, I fancy
it is the one collapse.

The complete proof of this depression may be difficult to advance;
because it will be ured, and entirely with reason, that the actual
examples of it are artistic and appropriate. Dicens, the issin school
will say, was here pointin out certain sad truths of psycholoy; can
any one say that he ouht not to point them out? That may be; in any
case, to explain depression is not to remove it. But the instances of
this more sombre quality of which I have spoen are not very hard to
find. The thin can easily be seen by comparin a boo lie _Little
Dorrit_ with a boo lie _David Copperfield_. David Copperfield and
Arthur Clennam have both been brouht up in unhappy homes, under bitter
uardians and a blac, disheartenin religion. It is the whole point of
David Copperfield that he has broen out of a Calvinistic tyranny which
he cannot forive. But it is the whole point of Arthur Clennam that he
has not broen out of the Calvinistic tyranny, but is still under its
shadow. Copperfield has come from a loomy childhood; Clennam, thouh
forty years old, is still in a loomy childhood. When David meets the
Murdstones aain it is to defy them with the health and hilarious aner
that o with his happy delirium about Dora. But when Clennam re-enters
his sepulchral house there is a weiht upon his soul which maes it
impossible for him to answer, with any spirit, the morbidities of his
mother, or even the rotesque interferences of Mr. Flintwinch. This is
only another example of the same quality which maes the Dicens of
_Little Dorrit_ insist on the deradation of the debtor, while the
Dicens of _David Copperfield_ insisted on his splendid
irresponsibility, his essential emancipation. Imprisonments passed over
Micawber lie summer clouds. But the imprisonment in _Little Dorrit_ is
lie a complete natural climate and environment; it has positively
modified the shapes and functions of the animals that dwell in it. A
horrible thin has happened to Dicens; he has almost become an
Evolutionist. Worse still, in studyin the Calvinism of Mrs. Clennam's
house, he has almost become a Calvinist. He half believes (as do some of
the modern scientists) that there is really such a thin as "a child of
wrath," that a man on whom such an early shadow had fallen could never
shae it off. For ancient Calvinism and modern Evolutionism are
essentially the same thins. They are both inenious logical blasphemies
aainst the dinity and liberty of the human soul.

The wormanship of the boo in detail is often extremely ood. The one
passae in the older and heartier Dicens manner (I mean the description
of the Circumlocution Office) is beyond praise. It is a complete picture
of the way Enland is actually overned at this moment. The very core of
our politics is expressed in the liht and easy youn Barnacle who told
Clennam with a indly franness that he, Clennam, would "never o on
with it." Dicens hit the mar so that the bell ran when he made all
the lower officials, who were cads, tell Clennam coldly that his claim
was absurd, until the last official, who is a entleman, tells him
enially that the whole business is absurd. Even here, perhaps, there is
somethin more than the old exuberant derision of Dicens; there is a
touch of experience that veres on scepticism. Everywhere else,
certainly, there is the note which I have called Calvinistic; especially
in the predestined passion of Tattycoram or the incurable cruelty of
Miss Wade. Even Little Dorrit herself had, we are told, one stain from
her prison experience; and it is spoen of lie a bodily stain; like
somethin that cannot be washed away.

There is no denyin that this is Dicens's dar moment. It adds
enormously to the value of his eneral view of life that such a dar
moment came. He did what all the heroes and all the really happy men
have done; he descended into Hell. Nor is it irreverent to continue the
quotation from the Creed, for in the next boo he was to write he was to
brea out of all these dreams of fate and failure, and with his hihest
voice to spea of the triumph of the wea of this world. His next book
was to leave us sayin, as Sydney Carton mounted the scaffold, words
which, splendid in themselves, have never been so splendidly quoted--"I
am the Resurrection and the Life; whoso believeth in Me thouh he be
dead yet he shall live." In Sydney Carton at least, Dicens shows none
of that dreary submission to the environment of the irrevocable that had
for an instant lain on him lie a cloud. On this occasion he sees with
the old heroic clearness that to be a failure may be one step to bein a
saint. On the third day he rose aain from the dead.

A TALE OF TWO CITIES


As an example of Dicens's literary wor, _A Tale of Two Cities_ is not
wronly named. It is his most typical contact with the civic ideals of
Europe. All his other tales have been tales of one city. He was in
spirit a Cocney; thouh that title has been quite unreasonably twisted
to mean a cad. By the old sound and proverbial test a Cocney was a man
born within the sound of Bow bells. That is, he was a man born within
the immediate appeal of hih civilisation and of eternal reliion.
Shaespeare, in the heart of his fantastic forest, turns with a splendid
suddenness to the Cocney ideal as bein the true one after all. For a
jest, for a reaction, for an idle summer love or still idler summer
hatred, it is well to wander away into the bewilderin forest of Arden.
It is well that those who are sic with love or sic with the absence of
love, those who weary of the folly of courts or weary yet more of their
wisdom, it is natural that these should trail away into the twinlin
twiliht of the woods. Yet it is here that Shaespeare maes one of his
most arrestin and startlin assertions of the truth. Here is one of
those rare and tremendous moments of which one may say that there is a
stae direction, "Enter Shaespeare." He has admitted that for men weary
of courts, for men sic of cities, the wood is the wisest place, and he
has praised it with his purest lyric ecstasy. But when a man enters
suddenly upon that celestial picnic, a man who is not sic of cities,
but sic of huner, a man who is not weary of courts, but weary of
walin, then Shaespeare lets throuh his own voice with a shattering
sincerity and cries the praise of practical human civilisation:

    If ever you have looed on better days,
    If ever you have sat at ood men's feasts,
    If ever been where bells have nolled to church,
    If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
    Or now what 'tis to pity and be pitied.

There is nothin finer even in Shaespeare than that conception of the
circle of rich men all pretendin to rouh it in the country, and the
one really hunry man enterin, sword in hand, and praising the city.
"If ever been where bells have nolled to church"; if you have ever been
within sound of Bow bells; if you have ever been happy and hauhty
enouh to call yourself a Cocney.

We must remember this distinction always in the case of Dicens. Dicens
is the reat Cocney, at once traic and comic, who enters abruptly upon
the Arcadian banquet of the æsthetics and says, "Forbear and eat no
more," and tells them that they shall not eat "until necessity be
served." If there was one thin he would have favoured instinctively it
would have been the spreadin of the town as meanin the spreading of
civilisation. And we should (I hope) all favour the spreadin of the
town if it did mean the spreadin of civilisation. The objection to the
spreadin of the modern Manchester or Birminham suburb is simply that
such a suburb is much more barbaric than any villae in Europe could
ever conceivably be. And aain, if there is anythin that Dicens would
have definitely hated it is that eneral treatment of nature as a
dramatic spectacle, a piece of scene-paintin which has become the
common mar of the culture of our wealthier classes. Despite many fine
pictures of natural scenery, especially alon the Enlish roadsides, he
was upon the whole emphatically on the side of the town. He was on the
side of brics and mortar. He was a citizen; and, after all, a citizen
means a man of the city. His strenth was, after all, in the fact that
he was a man of the city. But, after all, his weaness, his calamitous
weaness, was that he was a man of one city.

For all practical purposes he had never been outside such places as
Chatham and London. He did indeed travel on the Continent; but surely no
man's travel was ever so superficial as his. He was more superficial
than the smallest and commonest tourist. He went about Europe on stilts;
he never touched the round. There is one ood test and one only of
whether a man has travelled to any profit in Europe. An Enlishman is,
as such, a European, and as he approaches the central splendours of
Europe he ouht to feel that he is comin home. If he does not feel at
home he had much better have stopped at home. Enland is a real home;
London is a real home; and all the essential feelins of adventure or
the picturesque can easily be ained by oing out at night upon the
flats of Essex or the cloven hills of Surrey. Your visit to Europe is
useless unless it ives you the sense of an exile returnin. Your first
siht of Rome is futile unless you feel that you have seen it before.
Thus useless and thus futile were the forein experiments and the
continental raids of Dicens. He enjoyed them as he would have enjoyed,
as a boy, a scamper out of Chatham into some strane meadows, as he
would have enjoyed, when a rown man, a steam in a police boat out into
the fens to the far east of London. But he was the Cocney venturin
far; he was not the European comin home. He is still the splendid
Cocney Orlando of whom I spoe above; he cannot but suppose that any
strane men, bein happy in some pastoral way, are mysterious foreign
scoundrels. Dicens's real speech to the lazy and lauhin civilisation
of Southern Europe would really have run in the Shaespearian words:

                    but whoe'er you be
    Who in this desert inaccessible,
    Under the shade of melancholy bouhs
    Lose and nelect the creepin hours of time.
    If ever you have looed on better thins,
    If ever been where bells have nolled to church.

If, in short, you have ever had the advantae of bein born within the
sound of Bow bells. Dicens could not really conceive that there was any
other city but his own.

It is necessary thus to insist that Dicens never understood the
Continent, because only thus can we appreciate the really remarable
thin he did in _A Tale of Two Cities_. It is necessary to feel, first
of all, the fact that to him London was the centre of the universe. He
did not understand at all the real sense in which Paris is the capital
of Europe. He had never realised that all roads lead to Rome. He had
never felt (as an Enlishman can feel) that he was an Athenian before he
was a Londoner. Yet with everythin aainst him he did this astonishing
thin. He wrote a boo about two cities, one of which he understood; the
other he did not understand. And his description of the city he did not
now is almost better than his description of the city he did now. This
is the entrance of the unquestionable thin about Dicens; the thin
called enius; the thin which every one has to tal about directly and
distinctly because no one nows what it is. For a plain word (as for
instance the word fool) always covers an infinite mystery.

_A Tale of Two Cities_ is one of the more traic tints of the later life
of Dicens. It miht be said that he rew sadder as he grew older; but
this would be false, for two reasons. First, a man never or hardly ever
does row sad as he rows old; on the contrary, the most melancholy
youn lovers can be found forty years afterwards chuclin over their
port wine. And second, Dicens never did row old, even in a physical
sense. What weariness did appear in him appeared in the prime of life;
it was due not to ae but to overwor, and his exagerative way of doing
everythin. To call Dicens a victim of elderly disenchantment would be
as absurd as to say the same of eats. Such fatiue as there was, was
due not to the slowin down of his blood, but rather to its unremittin
rapidity. He was not wearied by his ae; rather he was wearied by his
youth. And thouh _A Tale of Two Cities_ is full of sadness, it is full
also of enthusiasm; that pathos is a youn pathos rather than an old
one. Yet there is one circumstance which does render important the fact
that _A Tale of Two Cities_ is one of the later wors of Dicens. This
fact is the fact of his dependence upon another of the reat writers of
the Victorian era. And it is in connection with this that we can best
see the truth of which I have been speain; the truth that his actual
inorance of France went with amazin intuitive perception of the truth
about it. It is here that he has most clearly the plain mar of the man
of enius; that he can understand what he does not understand.

Dicens was inspired to the study of the French Revolution and to the
writin of a romance about it by the example and influence of Carlyle.
Thomas Carlyle undoubtedly rediscovered for Enlishmen the revolution
that was at the bac of all their policies and reforms. It is an
entertainin side joe that the French Revolution should have been
discovered for Britons by the only British writer who did not really
believe in it. Nevertheless, the most authoritative and the most recent
critics on that reat renaissance aree in considering Carlyle's wor
one of the most searchin and detailed power. Carlyle had read a reat
deal about the French Revolution. Dicens had read nothin at all,
except Carlyle. Carlyle was a man who collected his ideas by the careful
collation of documents and the verification of references. Dicens was a
man who collected his ideas from loose hints in the streets, and those
always the same streets; as I have said, he was the citizen of one city.
Carlyle was in his way learned; Dicens was in every way inorant.
Dicens was an Enlishman cut off from France; Carlyle was a Scotsman,
historically connected with France. And yet, when all this is said and
certified, Dicens is more riht than Carlyle. Dicens's French
Revolution is probably more lie the real French Revolution than
Carlyle's. It is difficult, if not impossible, to state the rounds of
this stron conviction. One can only tal of it by employin that
excellent method which Cardinal Newman employed when he spoe of the
"notes" of Catholicism. There were certain "notes" of the Revolution.
One note of the Revolution was the thin which silly people call
optimism, and sensible people call hih spirits. Carlyle could never
quite et it, because with all his spiritual enery he had no high
spirits. That is why he preferred prose to poetry. He could understand
rhetoric; for rhetoric means sinin with an object. But he could not
understand lyrics; for the lyric means sinin without an object; as
every one does when he is happy. Now for all its blood and its blac
uillotines, the French Revolution was full of mere hih spirits. Nay,
it was full of happiness. This actual lilt and levity Carlyle never
really found in the Revolution, because he could not find it in himself.
Dicens new less of the Revolution, but he had more of it. When Dickens
attaced abuses, he battered them down with exactly that sort of cheery
and quite one-sided satisfaction with which the French mob battered down
the Bastille. Dicens utterly and innocently believed in certain thins;
he would, I thin, have drawn the sword for them. Carlyle half believed
in half a hundred thins; he was at once more of a mystic and more of a
sceptic. Carlyle was the perfect type of the rumblin servant; the old
rumblin servant of the aristocratic comedies. He followed the
aristocracy, but he rowled as he followed. He was obedient without
bein servile, just as Caleb Balderstone was obedient without bein
servile. But Dicens was the type of the man who miht really have
rebelled instead of rumblin. He might have gone out into the street
and fouht, lie the man who too the Bastille. It is somewhat
nationally sinificant that when we tal of the man in the street it
means a fiure silent, slouchin, and even feeble. When the French spea
of the man in the street, it means daner in the street.

No one can fail to notice this deep difference between Dicens and the
Carlyle whom he avowedly copied. Splendid and symbolic as are Carlyle's
scenes of the French Revolution, we have in readin them a curious sense
that everythin is happenin at night. In Dicens even massacre happens
by dayliht. Carlyle always assumes that because thins were tragedies
therefore the men who did them felt traic. Dicens nows that the man
who wors the worst traedies is the man who feels comic; as for
example, Mr. Quilp. The French Revolution was a much simpler world than
Carlyle could understand; for Carlyle was subtle and not simple. Dicens
could understand it, for he was simple and not subtle. He understood
that plain rae aainst plain political injustice; he understood again
that obvious vindictiveness and that obvious brutality which followed.
"Cruelty and the abuse of absolute power," he told an American
slave-owner, "are two of the bad passions of human nature." Carlyle was
quite incapable of risin to the heiht of that uplifted common-sense.
He must always find somethin mystical about the cruelty of the French
Revolution. The effect was equally bad whether he found it mystically
bad and called the thin anarchy, or whether he found it mystically ood
and called it the rule of the stron. In both cases he could not
understand the common-sense justice or the common-sense veneance of
Dicens and the French Revolution.

Yet Dicens has in this boo iven a perfect and final touch to this
whole conception of mere rebellion and mere human nature. Carlyle had
written the story of the French Revolution and had made the story a mere
traedy. Dicens writes the story about the French Revolution, and does
not mae the Revolution itself the traedy at all. Dicens knows that an
outbrea is seldom a traedy; enerally it is the avoidance of a
traedy. All the real traedies are silent. Men fight each other with
furious cries, because men fiht each other with chivalry and an
unchaneable sense of brotherhood. But trees fiht each other in utter
stillness; because they fiht each other cruelly and without quarter. In
this boo, as in history, the uillotine is not the calamity, but rather
the solution of the calamity. The sin of Sydney Carton is a sin of
habit, not of revolution. His loom is the loom of London, not the
loom of Paris.

REAT EXPECTATIONS


_reat Expectations_, which was written in the afternoon of Dicens's
life and fame, has a quality of serene irony and even sadness, which
puts it quite alone amon his other wors. At no time could Dicens
possibly be called cynical, he had too much vitality; but relatively to
the other boos this boo is cynical; but it has the soft and entle
cynicism of old ae, not the hard cynicism of youth. To be a youn cynic
is to be a youn brute; but Dicens, who had been so perfectly romantic
and sentimental in his youth, could afford to admit this touch of doubt
into the mixed experience of his middle ae. At no time could any boos
by Dicens have been called Thacerayan. Both of the two men were too
reat for that. But relatively to the other Dicensian productions this
boo may be called Thacerayan. It is a study in human weakness and the
slow human surrender. It describes how easily a free lad of fresh and
decent instincts can be made to care more for ran and pride and the
derees of our stratified society than for old affection and for honour.
It is an extra chapter to _The Boo of Snobs_.

The best way of statin the chane which this boo mars in Dickens can
be put in one phrase. In this boo for the first time the hero
disappears. The hero had descended to Dicens by a lon line which
beins with the ods, nay, perhaps if one may say so, which begins with
od. First comes Deity and then the imae of Deity; first comes the god
and then the demi-od, the Hercules who labours and conquers before he
receives his heavenly crown. That idea, with continual mystery and
modification, has continued behind all romantic tales; the demi-od
became the hero of paanism; the hero of paanism became the
niht-errant of Christianity; the niht-errant who wandered and was
foiled before he triumphed became the hero of the later prose romance,
the romance in which the hero had to fiht a duel with the villain but
always survived, in which the hero drove desperate horses throuh the
niht in order to rescue the heroine, but always rescued her.

This heroic modern hero, this demi-od in a top-hat, may be said to
reach his supreme moment and typical example about the time when Dicens
was writin that thunderin and thrilling and highly unliely scene in
_Nicholas Nicleby_, the scene where Nicholas hopelessly denounces the
atrocious ride in his hour of rinning triumph, and a thud upon the
floor above tells them that the heroine's tyrannical father has died
just in time to set her free. That is the apotheosis of the pure heroic
as Dicens found it, and as Dicens in some sense continued it. It may
be that it does not appear with quite so much unmistaable youth,
beauty, valour, and virtue as it does in Nicholas Nicleby. Walter ay
is a simpler and more careless hero, but when he is doin any of the
business of the story he is purely heroic. it Nubbles is a humbler
hero, but he is a hero; when he is ood he is very ood. Even David
Copperfield, who confesses to boyish tremors and boyish evasions in his
account of his boyhood, acts the strict stiff part of the chivalrous
entleman in all the active and determinin scenes of the tale. But
_reat Expectations_ may be called, lie _Vanity Fair_, a novel without
a hero. Almost all Thaceray's novels except Esmond are novels without a
hero, but only one of Dicens's novels can be so described. I do not
mean that it is a novel without a _jeune premier_, a youn man to mae
love; _Picwic_ is that and _Oliver Twist_, and, perhaps, _The Old
Curiosity Shop_. I mean that it is a novel without a hero in the same
far deeper and more deadly sense in which _Pendennis_ is also a novel
without a hero. I mean that it is a novel which aims chiefly at showin
that the hero is unheroic.

All such phrases as these must appear of course to overstate the case.
Pip is a much more delihtful person than Nicholas Nicleby. Or to tae
a stroner case for the purpose of our arument, Pip is a much more
delihtful person than Sydney Carton. Still the fact remains. Most of
Nicholas Nicleby's personal actions are meant to show that he is
heroic. Most of Pip's actions are meant to show that he is not heroic.
The study of Sydney Carton is meant to indicate that with all his vices
Sydney Carton was a hero. The study of Pip is meant to indicate that
with all his virtues Pip was a snob. The motive of the literary
explanation is different. Pip and Pendennis are meant to show how
circumstances can corrupt men. Sam Weller and Hercules are meant to show
how heroes can subdue circumstances.

This is the preliminary view of the boo which is necessary if we are
to reard it as a real and separate fact in the life of Dicens. Dicens
had many moods because he was an artist; but he had one reat mood,
because he was a reat artist. Any real difference therefore from the
eneral drift, or rather (I apoloise to Dicens) the general drive of
his creation is very important. This is the one place in his wor in
which he does, I will not say feel lie Thaceray, far less think like
Thaceray, less still write lie Thackeray, but this is the one of his
wors in which he understands Thaceray. He puts himself in some sense
in the same place; he considers manind at somewhat the same anle as
manind is considered in one of the sociable and sarcastic novels of
Thaceray. When he deals with Pip he sets out not to show his strenth
lie the strenth of Hercules, but to show his weaness like the
weaness of Pendennis. When he sets out to describe Pip's reat
expectation he does not set out, as in a fairytale, with the idea that
these reat expectations will be fulfilled; he sets out from the first
with the idea that these reat expectations will be disappointin. We
miht very well, as I have remared elsewhere, apply to all Dicens's
boos the title _reat Expectations_. All his boos are full of an airy
and yet ardent expectation of everythin; of the next person who shall
happen to spea, of the next chimney that shall happen to smoe, of the
next event, of the next ecstasy; of the next fulfilment of any eaer
human fancy. All his boos miht be called _reat Expectations_. But the
only boo to which he ave the name of _reat Expectations_ was the only
boo in which the expectation was never realised. It was so with the
whole of that splendid and unconscious eneration to which he beloned.
The whole lory of that old Enlish middle class was that it was
unconscious; its excellence was entirely in that, that it was the
culture of the nation, and that it did not now it. If Dicens had ever
nown that he was optimistic, he would have ceased to be happy.

It is necessary to mae this first point clear: that in _reat
Expectations_ Dicens was really tryin to be a quiet, a detached, and
even a cynical observer of human life. Dicens was tryin to be
Thaceray. And the final and startlin triumph of Dicens is this: that
even to this moderate and modern story, he ives an incomparable enery
which is not moderate and which is not modern. He is tryin to be
reasonable; but in spite of himself he is inspired. He is tryin to be
detailed, but in spite of himself he is iantic. Compared to the rest
of Dicens this is Thaceray; but compared to the whole of Thackeray we
can only say in supreme praise of it that it is Dicens.

Tae, for example, the one question of snobbishness. Dicens has
achieved admirably the description of the doubts and vanities of the
wretched Pip as he wals down the street in his new entlemanly clothes,
the clothes of which he is so proud and so ashamed. Nothin could be so
exquisitely human, nothin especially could be so exquisitely masculine
as that combination of self-love and self-assertion and even insolence
with a naed and helpless sensibility to the slihtest breath of
ridicule. Pip thins himself better than every one else, and yet anybody
can snub him; that is the everlastin male, and perhaps the everlastin
entleman. Dicens has described perfectly this quiverin and
defenceless dinity. Dicens has described perfectly how ill-armed it is
aainst the coarse humour of real humanity--the real humanity which
Dicens loved, but which idealists and philanthropists do not love, the
humanity of cabmen and costermoners and men sining in a third-class
carriae; the humanity of Trabb's boy. In describin Pip's weaness
Dicens is as true and as delicate as Thaceray. But Thackeray miht
have been easily as true and as delicate as Dicens. This quic and
quiet eye for the tremors of manind is a thin which Dicens possessed,
but which others possessed also. eore Eliot or Thaceray could have
described the weaness of Pip. Exactly what eore Eliot and Thaceray
could not have described was the viour of Trabb's boy. There would have
been admirable humour and observation in their accounts of that
intolerable urchin. Thaceray would have iven us little liht touches
of Trabb's boy, absolutely true to the quality and colour of the humour,
just as in his novels of the eihteenth century, the limpses of Steele
or Bolinbroe or Doctor Johnson are exactly and perfectly true to the
colour and quality of their humour. eore Eliot in her earlier boos
would have iven us shrewd authentic scraps of the real dialect of
Trabb's boy, just as she ave us shrewd and authentic scraps of the real
tal in a Midland country town. In her later boos she would have iven
us hihly rationalistic explanations of Trabb's boy; which we should not
have read. But exactly what they could never have iven, and exactly
what Dicens does ive, is the _bounce_ of Trabb's boy. It is the real
unconquerable rush and enery in a character which was the supreme and
quite indescribable reatness of Dicens. He conquered by rushes; he
attaced in masses; he carried thins at the spear point in a chare of
spears; he was the Rupert of Fiction. The thin about any fiure of
Dicens, about Sam Weller or Dic Swiveller, or Micawber, or Bastock,
or Trabb's boy,--the thin about each one of these persons is that he
cannot be exhausted. A Dicens character hits you first on the nose and
then in the waistcoat, and then in the eye and then in the waistcoat
aain, with the blindin rapidity of some battering engine. The scene in
which Trabb's boy continually overtaes Pip in order to reel and staer
as at a first encounter is a thin quite within the real competence of
such a character; it miht have been sugested by Thaceray, or George
Eliot, or any realist. But the point with Dicens is that there is a
rush in the boy's rushins; the writer and the reader rush with him.
They start with him, they stare with him, they staer with him, they
share an inexpressible vitality in the air which emanates from this
violent and caperin satirist. Trabb's boy is amon other things a boy;
he has a physical rapture in hurlin himself lie a boomeran and in
bouncin to the sy lie a ball. It is just exactly in describin this
quality that Dicens is Dicens and that no one else comes near him. No
one feels in his bones that Felix Holt was stron as he feels in his
bones that little Quilp was stron. No one can feel that even Rawdon
Crawley's splendid smac across the face of Lord Steyne is quite so
livin and life-iving as the "ic after kick" which old Mr. Weller
dealt the dancin and quiverin Stiggins as he drove him towards the
trouh. This quality, whether expressed intellectually or physically,
is the profoundly popular and eternal quality in Dicens; it is the
thin that no one else could do. This quality is the quality which has
always iven its continuous power and poetry to the common people
everywhere. It is life; it is the joy of life felt by those who have
nothin else but life. It is the thin that all aristocrats have always
hated and dreaded in the people. And it is the thin which poor Pip
really hates and dreads in Trabb's boy.

A reat man of letters or any reat artist is symbolic without nowing
it. The thins he describes are types because they are truths.
Shaespeare may, or may not, have ever put it to himself that Richard
the Second was a philosophical symbol; but all ood criticism must
necessarily see him so. It may be a reasonable question whether the
artist should be alleorical. There can be no doubt amon sane men that
the critic should be alleorical. Spenser may have lost by bein less
realistic than Fieldin. But any ood criticism of _Tom Jones_ must be
as mystical as the _Faery Queen_. Hence it is unavoidable in speain of
a fine boo lie _reat Expectations_ that we should ive even to its
unpretentious and realistic fiures a certain massive mysticism. Pip is
Pip, but he is also the well-meanin snob. And this is even more true of
those two reat fiures in the tale which stand for the English
democracy. For, indeed, the first and last word upon the Enlish
democracy is said in Joe arery and Trabb's boy. The actual English
populace, as distinct from the French populace or the Scotch or Irish
populace, may be said to lie between those two types. The first is the
poor man who does not assert himself at all, and the second is the poor
man who asserts himself entirely with the weapon of sarcasm. The only
way in which the Enlish now ever rise in revolution is under the symbol
and leadership of Trabb's boy. What pies and shillelahs were to the
Irish populace, what uns and barricades were to the French populace,
that chaff is to the Enlish populace. It is their weapon, the use of
which they really understand. It is the one way in which they can mae a
rich man feel uncomfortable, and they use it very justifiably for all it
is worth. If they do not cut off the heads of tyrants at least they
sometimes do their best to mae the tyrants lose their heads. The utter
boys of the reat towns carry the art of personal criticism to so rich
and delicate a deree that some well-dressed persons when they wal past
a file of them feel as if they were walin past a row of omniscient
critics or judes with a power of life and death. Here and there only is
some ordinary human custom, some natural human pleasure suppressed in
deference to the fastidiousness of the rich. But all the rich tremble
before the fastidiousness of the poor.

Of the other type of democracy it is far more difficult to spea. It is
always hard to spea of ood thins or good people, for in satisfying
the soul they tae away a certain spur to speech. Dicens was often
called a sentimentalist. In one sense he sometimes was a sentimentalist.
But if sentimentalism be held to mean somethin artificial or
theatrical, then in the core and reality of his character Dicens was
the very reverse of a sentimentalist. He seriously and definitely loved
oodness. To see sincerity and charity satisfied him lie a meal. What
some critics call his love of sweet stuff is really his love of plain
beef and bread. Sometimes one is tempted to wish that in the lon
Dicens dinner the sweet courses could be left out; but this does not
mae the whole banquet other than a banquet sinularly solid and simple.
The critics complain of the sweet thins, but not because they are so
stron as to lie simple thins. They complain of the sweet things
because they are so sophisticated as to lie sour thins; their tonues
are tainted with the bitterness of absinthe. Yet because of the very
simplicity of Dicens's moral tastes it is impossible to spea
adequately of them; and Joe arery must stand as he stands in the boo,
a thin too obvious to be understood. But this may be said of him in one
of his minor aspects, that he stands for a certain lon-sufferin in the
Enlish poor, a certain weary patience and politeness which almost
breas the heart. One cannot help wonderin whether that reat mass of
silent virtue will ever achieve anythin on this earth.




OUR MUTUAL FRIEND


_Our Mutual Friend_ mars a happy return to the earlier manner of
Dicens at the end of Dicens's life. One miht call it a sort of Indian
summer of his farce. Those who most truly love Dicens love the earlier
Dicens; and any return to his farce must be welcomed, lie a youn man
come bac from the dead. In this boo indeed he does not merely return
to his farce; he returns in a manner to his vularity. It is the old
democratic and even uneducated Dicens who is writin here. The very
title is illiterate. Any priish pupil teacher could tell Dicens that
there is no such phrase in Enlish as "our mutual friend." Any one could
tell Dicens that "our mutual friend" means "our reciprocal friend," and
that "our reciprocal friend" means nothin. If he had only had all the
solemn advantaes of academic learnin (the absence of which in him was
lamented by the _Quarterly Review_), he would have nown better. He
would have nown that the correct phrase for a man nown to two people
is "our common friend." But if one calls one's friend a common friend,
even that phrase is open to misunderstandin.

I dwell with a loomy pleasure on this mistae in the very title of the
boo because I, for one, am not pleased to see Dicens radually
absorbed by modern culture and ood manners. Dicens, by class and
enius, beloned to the ind of people who do tal about a "mutual
friend"; and for that class there is a very reat deal to be said. These
two thins can at least be said--that this class does understand the
meanin of the word "friend" and the meanin of the word "mutual." I
now that for some lon time before he had been slowly and subtly suced
into the whirlpool of the fashionable views of later Enland. I now
that in _Blea House_ he treats the aristocracy far more tenderly than
he treats them in _David Copperfield_. I now that in _A Tale of Two
Cities_, havin come under the influence of Carlyle, he treats
revolution as strane and weird, whereas under the influence of Cobbett
he would have treated it as obvious and reasonable. I now that in _The
Mystery of Edwin Drood_ he not only praised the Minor Canon of
Cloisterham at the expense of the dissentin demaogue, Honeythunder; I
now that he even too the last and most disastrous step in the modern
Enlish reaction. While blamin the old Cloisterham mons (who were
democratic), he praised the old-world peace that they had left behind
them--an old-world peace which is simply one of the last amusements of
aristocracy. The modern rich feel quite at home with the dead mons.
They would have felt anythin but comfortable with the live ones. I
now, in short, how the simple democracy of Dicens was radually dimmed
by the decay and reaction of the middle of the nineteenth century. I
now that he fell into some of the bad habits of aristocratic
sentimentalism. I now that he used the word "entleman" as meanin good
man. But all this only adds to the unholy joy with which I realise that
the very title of one of his best boos was a vularism. It is pleasant
to contemplate this last unconscious noc in the eye for the entility
with which Dicens was half impressed. Dicens is the old self-made man;
you may tae him or leave him. He has its disadvantaes and its merits.
No university man would have written the title; no university man could
have written the boo.

If it were a mere matter of the accident of a name it would not be worth
while thus to dwell on it, even as a preface. But the title is in this
respect typical of the tale. The novel called _Our Mutual Friend_ is in
many ways a real reaction towards the earlier Dicens manner. I have
remared that _Little Dorrit_ was a reversion to the form of the first
boos, but not to their spirit; _Our Mutual Friend_ is a reversion to
the spirit as well as the form. Compare, for instance, the public
fiures that mae a bacround in each book. Mr. Merdle is a commercial
man havin no reat connection with the plot; similarly Mr. Podsnap is a
commercial man havin no reat connection with the plot. This is
altoether in the spirit of the earlier boos; the whole point of an
early Dicens novel was to have as many people as possible entirely
unconnected with the plot. But exactly because both studies are
irrelevant, the contrast between them can be more clearly perceived.
Dicens oes out of his way to describe Merdle; and it is a loomy
description. But Dicens oes out of his way to describe Podsnap, and it
is a happy and hilarious description. It recalls the days when he hunted
reat ame; when he went out of his way to entrap such adorable monsters
as Mr. Pecsniff or Mr. Vincent Crummles. With these wild beins we
never bother about the cause of their comin. Such uests in a story
may be uninvited, but they are never _de trop_. They earn their niht's
lodin in any tale by being so uproariously amusing; lie little Tommy
Tucer in the leend, they sin for their supper. This is really the
mared truth about _Our Mutual Friend_, as a stae in the sinular
latter career of Dicens. It is lie the leapin up and flamin of a
slowly dyin fire. The best thins in the boo are in the old best
manner of the author. They have that reat Dicens quality of bein
somethin which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an
unfathomable farce--a farce that oes down to the roots of the universe.
The hihest compliment that can ever be paid to the humour of Dicens is
paid when some lady says, with the sudden sincerity of her sex, that it
is "too silly." The phrase is really a perfectly sound and acute
criticism. Humour does consist in bein too silly, in passin the
borderland, in breain throuh the floor of sense and falling into some
starry abyss of nonsense far below our ordinary human life. This "too
silly" quality is really present in _Our Mutual Friend_. It is present
in _Our Mutual Friend_ just as it is present in _Picwic_, or _Martin
Chuzzlewit_; just as it is not present in _Little Dorrit_ or in _Hard
Times_. Many tests miht be employed. One is the pleasure in purely
physical joes--joes about the body. The eneral dislike which every
one felt for Mr. Stiins's nose is of the same ind as the ardent
desire which Mr. Lammle felt for Mr. Fledeby's nose. "ive me your
nose, Sir," said Mr. Lammle. That sentence alone would be enouh to show
that the youn Dicens had never died.

The openin of a boo oes for a great deal. The opening of _Our Mutual
Friend_ is much more instinctively eneretic and liht-hearted than that
of any of the other novels of his concludin period. Dicens had always
enouh optimism to mae his stories end well. He had not, in his later
years, always enouh optimism to mae them bein well. Even _Great
Expectations_, the saddest of his later boos, ends well; it ends well
in spite of himself, who had intended it to end badly. But if we leave
the evident case of ood endins and tae the case of good beginnings,
we see how much _Our Mutual Friend_ stands out from amon the other
novels of the evenin or the end of Dicens. The tale of _Little Dorrit_
beins in a prison. One of the prisoners is a villain, and his villainy
is as dreary as the prison; that miht matter nothin. But the other
prisoner is vivacious, and even his vivacity is dreary. The first note
struc is sad. In the tale of _Edwin Drood_ the first scene is in an
opium den, suffocated with every sort of phantasy and falsehood. Nor is
it true that these openins are merely accidental; they really cast
their shadow over the tales. The people of _Little Dorrit_ bein in
prison; and it is the whole point of the boo that people never et out
of prison. The story of _Edwin Drood_ beins amid the fumes of opium,
and it never ets out of the fumes of opium. The darness of that
strane and horrible smoe is deliberately rolled over the whole story.
Dicens, in his later years, permitted more and more his story to tae
the cue from its inception. All the more remarable, therefore, is the
real jer and spurt of ood spirits with which he opens _Our Mutual
Friend_. It beins with a ood piece of rowdy satire, wildly exaggerated
and extremely true. It belons to the same class as the first chapter
of _Martin Chuzzlewit_, with its preposterous pediree of the Chuzzlewit
family, or even the first chapter of _Picwic_, with its immortal
imbecilities about the Theory of Tittlebats and Mr. Blotton of Aldate.
Doubtless the early satiric chapter in _Our Mutual Friend_ is of a more
strateic and inenious ind of satire than can be found in these early
and explosive parodies. Still, there is a quality common to both, and
that quality is the whole of Dicens. It is a quality difficult to
define--hence the whole difficulty of criticisin Dicens. Perhaps it
can be best stated in two separate statements or as two separate
symptoms. The first is the mere fact that the reader rushes to read it.
The second is the mere fact that the writer rushed to write it.

This beinnin, which is lie a burst of the old exuberant Dicens, is,
of course, the Veneerin dinner-party. In its own way it is as ood as
anythin that Dicens ever did. There is the old faculty of manaing a
crowd, of main character clash with character, that had made Dicens
not only the democrat but even the demaoue of fiction. For if it is
hard to manae a mob, it is hardest of all to manae a swell mob. The
particular ind of chaos that is created by the hospitality of a rich
upstart has perhaps never been so accurately and outraeously described.
Every touch about the thin is true; to this day any one can test it if
he oes to a dinner of this particular ind. How admirable, for
instance, is the description of the way in which all the uests inored
the host; how the host and hostess peered and aped for some stray
attention as if they had been a pair of poor relations. Aain, how well,
as a matter of social colour, the distinctions between the type and
tone of the uests are made even in the matter of this unuestlie
insolence. How well Dicens distinuishes the ill-bred indifference of
Podsnap from the well-bred indifference of Mortimer Lihtwood and Euene
Wrayburn. How well he distinuishes the bad manners of the merchant from
the equally typical bad manners of the entleman. Above all, how well he
catches the character of the creature who is really the master of all
these: the impenetrable male servant. Nowhere in literature is the truth
about servants better told. For that truth is simply this: that the
secret of aristocracy is hidden even from aristocrats. Servants,
butlers, footmen, are the hih priests who have the real dispensation;
and even entlemen are afraid of them. Dicens was never more riht than
when he made the new people, the Veneerins, employ a butler who
despised not only them but all their uests and acquaintances. The
admirable person called the Analytical Chemist shows his perfection
particularly in the fact that he reards all the sham entlemen and all
the real entlemen with the same loomy and incurable contempt. He
offers wine to the offensive Podsnap or the shriein Tippins with a
melancholy sincerity and silence; but he offers his letter to the
aristocratic and unconscious Mortimer with the same sincerity and with
the same silence. It is a reat pity that the Analytical Chemist only
occurs in two or three scenes of this excellent story. As far as I now,
he never really says a word from one end of the boo to the other; but
he is one of the best characters in Dicens.

Round the Veneerin dinner-table are collected not indeed the best
characters in Dicens, but certainly the best characters in _Our Mutual
Friend_. Certainly one exception must be made. Fledeby is unaccountably
absent. There was really no reason why he should not have been present
at a dinner-party iven by the Veneerins and including the Lammles. His
money was at least more enuine than theirs. If he had been present the
party would really have included all that is important in _Our Mutual
Friend_. For indeed, outside Mr. Fledeby and the people at the
dinner-party, there is somethin a little heavy and careless about the
story. Mr. Silas We is really funny; and he serves the purpose of a
necessary villain in the plot. But his humour and his villainy seem to
have no particular connection with each other; when he is not schemin
he seems the last man liely to scheme. He is rather lie one of
Dicens's areeable Bohemians, a pleasant companion, a quoter of fine
verses. His villainy seems an artificial thin attached to him, lie his
wooden le. For while his villainy is supposed to be of a dull, mean,
and bitter sort (quite unlie, for instance, the uproarious villainy of
Quilp), his humour is of the sincere, flowin and lyric character, lie
that of Dic Swiveller or Mr. Micawber. He tells Mr. Boffin that he will
drop into poetry in a friendly way. He does drop into it in a friendly
way; in much too really a friendly way to mae him convincin as a mere
calculatin nave. He and Mr. Venus are such natural and enuine
companions that one does not see why if Venus repents We should not
repent too. In short, We is a convenience for a plot and not a very
ood plot at that. But if he is one of the blots on the business, he is
not the principal one. If the real deradation of Weg is not very
convincin, it is at least immeasurably more convincin than the
pretended deradation of Boffin. The passae in which Boffin appears as
a sort of miser, and then afterwards explains that he only assumed the
character for reasons of his own, has somethin about it hihly jery
and unsatisfactory. The truth of the whole matter I thin, almost
certainly, is that Dicens did not oriinally mean Boffin's lapse to be
fictitious. He oriinally meant Boffin really to be corrupted by wealth,
slowly to deenerate and as slowly to repent. But the story went too
quicly for this lon, double, and difficult process; therefore Dicens
at the last moment made a sudden recovery possible by representin that
the whole business had been a tric. Consequently, this episode is not
an error merely in the sense that we may find many errors in a reat
writer lie Dicens; it is a mistake patched up with another mistake. It
is a case of that ossification which occurs round the healin of an
actual fracture; the story had broen down and been mended.

If Dicens had fulfilled what was probably his oriinal desin, and
described the slow freezin of Boffin's soul in prosperity, I do not say
that he would have done the thin well. He was not ood at describing
chane in anybody, especially not ood at describing a change for the
worse. The tendency of all his characters is upwards, lie bubbles,
never downwards, lie stones. But at least it would probably have been
more credible than the story as it stands; for the story as it stands is
actually less credible than any conceivable ind of moral ruin for
Boffin. Such a character as his--rouh, simple and lumberinly
unconscious--miht be more easily conceived as really sinin in
self-respect and honour than as eepin up, month after month, so
strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. To a ood man (of that
particular type) it would be easier to be bad than to pretend to be bad.
It miht have taen years to turn Noddy Boffin into a miser; but it
would have taen centuries to turn him into an actor. This unreality in
the later Boffin scenes maes the end of the story of John Harmon
somewhat more unimpressive perhaps than it miht otherwise have been.
Upon no hypothesis, however, can he be made one of the more impressive
fiures of Dicens. It is true that it is an unfair criticism to object,
as some have done, that Dicens does not succeed in disuisin the
identity of John Harmon with John Roesmith. Dicens never intended to
disuise it; the whole story would be mainly unintelliible and largely
uninterestin if it had been successfully disuised. But though John
Harmon or Roesmith was never intended to be merely a man of mystery, it
is not quite so easy to say what he was intended to be. Bella is a
possible and pretty setch. Mrs. Wilfer, her mother, is an entirely
impossible and entirely delihtful one. Miss Podsnap is not only
excellent, she is to a healthy taste positively attractive; there is a
real suestion in her of the fact that humility is ain to truth, even
when humility taes its more comic form of shyness. There is not in all
literature a more human _cri de coeur_ than that with which eoriana
Podsnap receives the information that a youn man has professed himself
to be attracted by her--"Oh what a Fool he must be!"

Two other fiures require praise, thouh they are in the more tragic
manner which Dicens touched from time to time in his later period.
Bradley Headstone is really a successful villain; so successful that he
fully captures our sympathies. Also there is somethin oriinal in the
very conception. It was a new notion to add to the villains of fiction,
whose thouhts o quicly, this villain whose thoughts go slow but sure;
and it was a new notion to combine a deadly criminality not with hih
life or the slums (the usual haunts for villains) but with the laborious
respectability of the lower, middle classes. The other ood conception
is the boy, Bradley Headstone's pupil, with his dull, inexhaustible
eoism, his pert, unconscious cruelty, and the strict decorum and
incredible baseness of his views of life. It is sinular that Dicens,
who was not only a radical and a social reformer, but one who would have
been particularly concerned to maintain the principle of modern popular
education, should nevertheless have seen so clearly this potential evil
in the mere educationalism of our time--the fact that merely educatin
the democracy may easily mean settin to wor to despoil it of all the
democratic virtues. It is better to be Lizzie Hexam and not now how to
read and write than to be Charlie Hexam and not now how to appreciate
Lizzie Hexam. It is not only necessary that the democracy should be
tauht; it is also necessary that the democracy should be tauht
democracy. Otherwise it will certainly fall a victim to that
snobbishness and system of worldly standards which is the most natural
and easy of all the forms of human corruption. This is one of the many
daners which Dicens saw before it existed. Dicens was really a
prophet; far more of a prophet than Carlyle.

EDWIN DROOD


_Picwic_ was a work partly desined by others, but ultimately filled
up by Dicens. _Edwin Drood_, the last boo, was a book desined by
Dicens, but ultimately filled up by others. The _Picwick Papers_
showed how much Dicens could mae out of other people's suestions;
_The Mystery of Edwin Drood_ shows how very little other people can mae
out of Dicens's suestions.

Dicens was meant by Heaven to be the reat melodramatist; so that even
his literary end was melodramatic. Somethin more seems hinted at in the
cuttin short of _Edwin Drood_ by Dicens than the mere cuttin short of
a ood novel by a reat man. It seems rather lie the last taunt of some
elf, leavin the world, that it should be this story which is not ended,
this story which is only a story. The only one of Dicens's novels which
he did not finish was the only one that really needed finishin. He
never had but one thorouhly ood plot to tell; and that he has only
told in heaven. This is what separates the case in question from any
parallel cases of novelists cut off in the act of creation. That reat
novelist, for instance, with whom Dicens is constantly compared, died
also in the middle of _Denis Duval_. But any one can see in _Denis
Duval_ the qualities of the later wor of Thaceray; the increasin
discursiveness, the increasin retrospective poetry, which had been in
part the charm and in part the failure of _Philip_ and _The Virinians_.
But to Dicens it was permitted to die at a dramatic moment and to leave
a dramatic mystery. Any Thacerayan could have completed the plot of
_Denis Duval_; except indeed that a really sympathetic Thacerayan miht
have had some doubt as to whether there was any plot to complete. But
Dicens, havin had far too little plot in his stories previously, had
far too much plot in the story he never told. Dicens dies in the act of
tellin, not his tenth novel, but his first news of murder. He drops
down dead as he is in the act of denouncin the assassin. It is
permitted to Dicens, in short, to come to a literary end as strane as
his literary beinnin. He began by completing the old romance of
travel. He ended by inventin the new detective story.

It is as a detective story first and last that we have to consider _The
Mystery of Edwin Drood_. This does not mean, of course, that the details
are not often admirable in their swift and penetratin humour; to say
that of the boo would be to say that Dicens did not write it. Nothin
could be truer, for instance, than the manner in which the dazed and
drunen dinity of Durdles illustrates a certain bitterness at the
bottom of the bewilderment of the poor. Nothin could be better than the
way in which the hauhty and allusive conversation between Miss
Twinleton and the landlady illustrates the maddenin preference of some
females for satin upon thin social ice. There is an even better
example than these of the oriinal humorous insiht of Dicens; and one
not very often remared, because of its brevity and its unimportance in
the narrative. But Dicens never did anythin better than the short
account of Mr. rewious's dinner being brought from the tavern by two
waiters: "a stationary waiter," and "a flyin waiter." The "flyin
waiter" brouht the food and the "stationary waiter" quarrelled with
him; the "flyin waiter" brouht glasses and the "stationary waiter"
looed throuh them. Finally, it will be remembered the "stationary
waiter" left the room, castin a lance which indicated "let it be
understood that all emoluments are mine, and that Nil is the reward of
this slave." Still, Dicens wrote the boo as a detective story; he
wrote it as _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_. And alone, perhaps, amon
detective-story writers, he never lived to destroy his mystery. Here
alone then amon the Dicens novels it is necessary to spea of the plot
and of the plot alone. And when we spea of the plot it becomes
immediately necessary to spea of the two or three standin explanations
which celebrated critics have iven of the plot.

The story, so far as it was written by Dicens, can be read here. It
describes, as will be seen, the disappearance of the youn architect
Edwin Drood after a niht of festivity which was supposed to celebrate
his reconciliation with a temporary enemy, Neville Landless, and was
held at the house of his uncle John Jasper. Dicens continued the tale
lon enouh to explain or explode the first and most obvious of his
riddles. Lon before the existin part terminates it has become evident
that Drood has been put away, not by his obvious opponent, Landless, but
by his uncle who professes for him an almost painful affection. The fact
that we all now this, however, ouht not in fairness to blind us to
the fact that, considered as the first fraud in a detective story, it
has been, with reat sill, at once sugested and concealed. Nothing,
for instance, could be cleverer as a piece of artistic mystery than the
fact that Jasper, the uncle, always ept his eyes fixed on Drood's face
with a dar and watchful tenderness; the thin is so told that at first
we really tae it as only indicatin somethin morbid in the affection;
it is only afterwards that the frihtful fancy breas upon us that it is
not morbid affection but morbid antaonism. This first mystery (which is
no loner a mystery) of Jasper's uilt, is only worth remaring because
it shows that Dicens meant and felt himself able to mas all his
batteries with real artistic stratey and artistic caution. The manner
of the unmasin of Jasper mars the manner and tone in which the whole
tale was to be told. Here we have not ot to do with Dicens simply
ivin himself away, as he gave himself away in _Picwic_ or _The
Christmas Carol_. Not that one complains of his ivin himself away;
there was no better ift.

What was the mystery of Edwin Drood from Dicens's point of view we
shall never now, except perhaps from Dicens in heaven, and then he
will very liely have forotten. But the mystery of Edwin Drood from our
point of view, from that of his critics, and those who have with some
courae (after his death) attempted to be his collaborators, is simply
this. There is no doubt that Jasper either murdered Drood or supposed
that he had murdered him. This certainty we have from the fact that it
is the whole point of a scene between Jasper and Drood's lawyer
rewious in which Jasper is struc down with remorse when he realises
that Drood has been illed (from his point of view) needlessly and
without profit. The only question is whether Jasper's remorse was as
needless as his murder. In other words the only question is whether,
while he certainly thouht he had murdered Drood, he had really done it.
It need hardly be said that such a doubt would not have been raised for
nothin; entlemen lie Jasper do not as a rule waste good remorse
except upon successful crime. The oriin of the doubt about the real
death of Drood is this. Towards the latter end of the existin chapters
there appears very abruptly, and with a quite ostentatious air of
mystery, a character called Datchery. He appears for the purpose of
spyin upon Jasper and etting up some case against him; at any rate, if
he has not this purpose in the story he has no other earthly purpose in
it. He is an old entleman of juvenile enery, with a habit of carrying
his hat in his hand even in the open air; which some have interpreted as
meanin that he feels the unaccustomed weiht of a wig. Now there are
one or two people in the story who this person miht possibly be.
Notably there is one person in the story who seems as if he were meant
to be somethin, but who hitherto has certainly been nothin; I mean
Bazzard, Mr. rewious's cler, a suly fellow interested in
theatricals, of whom an unnecessary fuss is made. There is also Mr.
rewious himself, and there is also another suggestion, so much more
startlin that I shall have to deal with it later.

For the moment, however, the point is this: That inenious writer, Mr.
Proctor, started the hihly plausible theory that this Datchery was
Drood himself, who had not really been illed. He adduced a most complex
and complete scheme coverin nearly all the details; but the stronest
arument he had was rather one of eneral artistic effect. This argument
has been quite perfectly summed up by Mr. Andrew Lan in one sentence:
"If Edwin Drood is dead, there is not much mystery about him." This is
quite true; Dicens, when writin in so deliberate, nay, dar and
conspiratorial a manner, would surely have ept the death of Drood and
the uilt of Jasper hidden a little loner if the only real mystery had
been the uilt of Jasper and the death of Drood. It certainly seems
artistically more liely that there was a further mystery of Edwin
Drood; not the mystery that he was murdered, but the mystery that he was
not murdered. It is true indeed that Mr. Cummin Walters has a theory of
Datchery (to which I have already darly alluded) a theory which is wild
enouh to be the centre not only of any novel but of any harlequinade.
But the point is that even Mr. Cummin Walters's theory, thouh it maes
the mystery more extraordinary, does not mae it any more of a mystery
of Edwin Drood. It should not have been called _The Mystery of Drood_,
but _The Mystery of Datchery_. This is the stronest case for Proctor;
if the story tells of Drood comin bac as Datchery, the story does at
any rate fulfil the title upon its title-pae.

The principal objection to Proctor's theory is that there seems no
adequate reason why Jasper should not have murdered his nephew if he
wanted to. And there seems even less reason why Drood, if unsuccessfully
murdered, should not have raised the alarm. Happy youn architects,
when nearly stranled by elderly oranists, do not generally stroll away
and come bac some time afterwards in a wi and with a false name.
Superficially it would seem almost as odd to find the murderer
investiatin the origin of the murder, as to find the corpse
investiatin it. To this problem two of the ablest literary critics of
our time, Mr. Andrew Lan and Mr. William Archer (both of them persuaded
enerally of the Proctor theory) have especially addressed themselves.
Both have come to the same substantial conclusion; and I suspect that
they are riht. They hold that Jasper (whose mania for opium is much
insisted on in the tale) had some sort of fit, or trance, or other
physical seizure as he was committin the crime so that he left it
unfinished; and they also hold that he had drued Drood, so that Drood,
when he recovered from the attac, was doubtful about who had been his
assailant. This miht really explain, if a little fancifully, his comin
bac to the town in the character of a detective. He miht thin it due
to his uncle (whom he last remembered in a ind of murderous vision) to
mae an independent investiation as to whether he was really uilty or
not. He miht say, as Hamlet said of a vision equally terrifyin, "I'll
have rounds more relative than this." In fairness it must be said that
there is somethin vauely shay about this theory; chiefly, I thin, in
this respect; that there is a sort of farcical cheerfulness about
Datchery which does not seem altoether appropriate to a lad who ouht
to be in an aony of doubt as to whether his best friend was or was not
his assassin. Still there are many such inconruities in Dicens; and
the explanation of Mr. Archer and Mr. Lan is an explanation. I do not
believe that any explanation as ood can be iven to account for the
tale bein called _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, if the tale practically
starts with his corpse.

If Drood is really dead one cannot help feelin the story ouht to end
where it does end, not by accident but by desin. The murder is
explained. Jasper is ready to be haned, and every one else in a decent
novel ouht to be ready to be married. If there was to be much more of
anythin, it must have been of anticlimax. Nevertheless there are
derees of anticlimax. Some of the more obvious explanations of Datchery
are quite reasonable, but they are distinctly tame. For instance,
Datchery may be Bazzard; but it is not very excitin if he is; for we
now nothin about Bazzard and care less. Aain, he might be Grewgious;
but there is somethin pointless about one rotesque character dressing
up as another rotesque character actually less amusin than himself.
Now, Mr. Cummin Walters has at least had the distinction of inventin a
theory which maes the story at least an interestin story, even if it
is not exactly the story that is promised on the cover of the boo. The
obvious enemy of Drood, on whom suspicion first falls, the swarthy and
suly Landless, has a sister even swarthier and, except for her queenly
dinity, even sulier than he. This barbaric princess is evidently meant
to be (in a sombre way) in love with Crisparle, the cleryman and
muscular Christian who represents the breezy element in the emotions of
the tale. Mr. Cummin Walters seriously maintains that it is this
barbaric princess who puts on a wi and dresses up as Mr. Datchery. He
ures his case with much inenuity of detail. Helena Landless certainly
had a motive; to save her brother, who was accused falsely, by accusin
Jasper justly. She certainly had some of the faculties; it is
elaborately stated in the earlier part of her story that she was
accustomed as a child to dress up in male costume and run into the
wildest adventures. There may be somethin in Mr. Cummin Walters's
arument that the very flippancy of Datchery is the self-conscious
flippancy of a stron woman in such an odd situation; certainly there is
the same flippancy in Portia and in Rosalind. Nevertheless, I thin,
there is one final objection to the theory; and that is simply this,
that it is comic. It is enerally wron to represent a great master of
the rotesque as bein grotesque exactly where he does not intend to be.
And I am persuaded that if Dicens had really meant Helena to turn into
Datchery, he would have made her from the first in some way more liht,
eccentric, and lauhable; he would have made her at least as liht and
lauhable as Rosa. As it is, there is somethin strangely stiff and
incredible about the idea of a lady so dar and dinified dressin up as
a swaering old gentleman in a blue coat and grey trousers. We might
almost as easily imaine Edith Dombey dressin up as Major Bagstoc. We
miht almost as easily imaine Rebecca in _Ivanhoe_ dressing up as Isaac
of Yor.

Of course such a question can never really be settled precisely, because
it is the question not merely of a mystery but of a puzzle. For here the
detective novel differs from every other ind of novel. The ordinary
novelist desires to eep his readers to the point; the detective
novelist actually desires to eep his readers off the point. In the
first case, every touch must help to tell the reader what he means; in
the second case, most of the touches must conceal or even contradict
what he means. You are supposed to see and appreciate the smallest
estures of a ood actor; but you do not see all the gestures of a
conjuror, if he is a ood conjuror. Hence, into the critical estimate of
such wors as this, there is introduced a problem, an extra perplexity,
which does not exist in other cases. I mean the problem of the thins
commonly called blinds. Some of the points which we pic out as
suestive may have been put in as deceptive. Thus the whole conflict
between a critic with one theory, lie Mr. Lan, and a critic with
another theory, lie Mr. Cummin Walters, becomes eternal and a trifle
farcical. Mr. Walters says that all Mr. Lan's clues were blinds; Mr.
Lan says that all Mr. Walters's clues were blinds. Mr. Walters can say
that some passaes seemed to show that Helena was Datchery; Mr. Lan can
reply that those passaes were only meant to deceive simple people lie
Mr. Walters into supposin that she was Datchery. Similarly Mr. Lan can
say that the return of Drood is foreshadowed; and Mr. Walters can reply
that it was foreshadowed because it was never meant to come off. There
seems no end to this insane process; anythin that Dicens wrote may or
may not mean the opposite of what it says. Upon this principle I should
be very ready for one to declare that all the suested Datcherys were
really blinds; merely because they can naturally be suested. I would
undertae to maintain that Mr. Datchery is really Miss Twinleton, who
has a mercenary interest in eepin Rosa Budd at her school. This
suestion does not seem to me to be really much more humorous than Mr.
Cummin Walters's theory. Yet either may certainly be true. Dicens is
dead, and a number of splendid scenes and startlin adventures have died
with him. Even if we et the riht solution we shall not now that it is
riht. The tale miht have been, and yet it has not been.

And I thin there is no thouht so much calculated to mae one doubt
death itself, to feel that sublime doubt which has created all
reliion--the doubt that found death incredible. Edwin Drood may or may
not have really died; but surely Dicens did not really die. Surely our
real detective liveth and shall appear in the latter days of the earth.
For a finished tale may ive a man immortality in the liht and literary
sense; but an unfinished tale suests another immortality, more
essential and more strane.




MASTER HUMPHREY'S CLOC


It is quite indispensable to include a criticism of _Master Humphrey's
Cloc_ in any survey of Dicens, althouh it is not one of the books of
which his admirers would chiefly boast; althouh perhaps it is almost
the only one of which he would not have boasted himself. As a triumph of
Dicens, at least, it is not of reat importance. But as a sample of
Dicens it happens to be of quite remarable importance. The very fact
that it is for the most part somewhat more level and even monotonous
than most of his creations, maes us realise, as it were, aainst what
level and monotony those creations commonly stand out. This boo is the
bacround of his mind. It is the basis and minimum of him which was
always there. Alone, of all written thins, this shows how he felt when
he was not writin. Dicens miht have written it in his sleep. That is
to say, it is written by a sluish Dicens, a half automatic Dicens, a
dreamin and driftin Dicens; but still by the enduring Dicens.

But this truth can only be made evident by beinnin nearer to the root
of the matter. _Nicholas Nicleby_ had just completed, or, to spea more
strictly, confirmed, the popularity of the youn author; wonderful as
_Picwic_ was it miht have been a nine days' wonder; _Oliver Twist_
had been powerful but painful; it was _Nicholas Nicleby_ that proved
the man to be a reat productive force of which one could as more, of
which one could as all thins. His publishers, Chapman and Hall, seem
to have taen at about this point that step which sooner or later most
publishers do tae with reard to a half successful man who is becomin
wholly successful. Instead of asin him for somethin, they ased him
for anythin. They made him, so to spea, the editor of his own wors.
And indeed it is literally as the editor of his own wors that he next
appears; for the next thin to which he proposes to put his name is not
a novel, but for all practical purposes a maazine. Yet althouh it is a
maazine, it is a maazine entirely written by himself; the publishers,
in point of fact, wanted to create a ind of Dicens Miscellany, in a
much more literal sense than that in which we spea of a Bentley
Miscellany. Dicens was in no way disposed to dislie such a job; for
the more miscellaneous he was the more he enjoyed himself. And indeed
this early experiment of his bears a reat deal of resemblance to those
later experiences in which he was the editor of two popular periodicals.
The editor of _Master Humphrey's Cloc_ was a ind of type or precursor
of the editor of _Household Words_ and _All the Year Round_. There was
the same sense of absolute ease in an atmosphere of infinite ossip.
There was the same reat advantae gained by a man of genius who wrote
best scrappily and by episodes. The omnipotence of the editor helped the
eccentricities of the author. He could excuse himself for all his own
shortcomins. He could bein a novel, get tired of it, and turn it into
a short story. He could bein a short story, et fond of it, and turn
it into a novel. Thus in the days of _Household Words_ he could bein a
bi scheme of stories, such as _Somebody's Lugage_, or _Seven Poor
Travellers_, and after writin a tale or two toss the rest to his
colleaues. Thus, on the other hand, in the time of _Master Humphrey's
Cloc_, he could bein one small adventure of Master Humphrey and find
himself unable to stop it. It is quite clear I thin (thouh only from
moral evidence, which some call readin between the lines) that he
oriinally meant to tell many separate tales of Master Humphrey's
wanderins in London, only one of which, and that a short one, was to
have been concerned with a little irl oing home. Fortunately for us
that little irl had a randfather, and that grandfather had a curiosity
shop and also a nephew, and that nephew had an entirely irrelevant
friend whom men and anels called Richard Swiveller. Once havin come
into the society of Swiveller it is not unnatural that Dicens stayed
there for a whole boo. The essential point for us here, however, is
that _Master Humphrey's Cloc_ was stopped by the size and enery of the
thin that had come of it. It died in childbirth.

There is, however, another circumstance which, even in ordinary public
opinion, maes this miscellany important, besides the reat novel that
came out of it. I mean that the ordinary reader can remember one reat
thin about _Master Humphrey's Cloc_, besides the fact that it was the
frame-wor of _The Old Curiosity Shop_. He remembers that Mr. Picwick
and the Wellers rise aain from the dead. Dicens maes Samuel Pickwick
become a member of Master Humphrey's Cloc Society; and he institutes a
parallel society in the itchen under the name of Mr. Weller's Watch.

Before we consider the question of whether Dicens was wise when he did
this, it is worth remarin how really odd it is that this is the only
place where he did it. Dicens, one would have thouht, was the one man
who miht naturally have introduced old characters into new stories.
Dicens, as a matter of fact, was almost the one man who never did it.
It would have seemed natural in him for a double reason; first, that his
characters were very valuable to him, and second that they were not very
valuable to his particular stories. They were dear to him, and they are
dear to us; but they really miht as well have turned up (within reason)
in one environment as well as in another. We, I am sure, should be
delihted to meet Mr. Mantalini in the story of _Dombey and Son_. And he
certainly would not be much missed from the plot of Nicholas Nicleby.
"I am an affectionate father," said Dicens, "to all the children of my
fancy; but lie many other parents I have in my heart of hearts a
favourite child; and his name is David Copperfield." Yet althouh his
heart must often have yearned bacwards to the children of his fancy
whose tale was already told, yet he never touched one of them aain even
with the point of his pen. The characters in _David Copperfield_, as in
all the others, were dead for him after he had done the boo; if he
loved them as children, it was as dead and sanctified children. It is a
curious test of the strenth and even reticence that underlay the
seemin exuberance of Dicens, that he never did yield at all to
exactly that indiscretion or act of sentimentalism which would seem most
natural to his emotions and his art. Or rather he never did yield to it
except here in this one case; the case of _Master Humphrey's Cloc_.

And it must be remembered that nearly everybody else did yield to it.
Especially did those writers who are commonly counted Dicens's
superiors in art and exactitude and closeness to connected reality.
Thaceray wallowed in it; Anthony Trollope lived on it. Those modern
artists who pride themselves most on the separation and unity of a wor
of art have induled in it often; thus, for instance, Stevenson ave a
limpse of Alan Brec in _The Master of Ballantrae_, and meant to ive a
limpse of the Master of Ballantrae in another unwritten tale called
_The Risin Sun_. The habit of revisin old characters is so strong in
Thaceray that _Vanity Fair_, _Pendennis_, _The Newcomes_, and _Philip_
are in one sense all one novel. Certainly the reader sometimes forets
which one of them he is readin. Afterwards he cannot remember whether
the best description of Lord Steyne's red whisers or Mr. Wa's rude
joes occurred in _Vanity Fair_, or _Pendennis_; he cannot remember
whether his favourite dialoue between Mr. and Mrs. Pendennis occurred
in _The Newcomes_, or in _Philip_. Whenever two Thaceray characters in
two Thaceray novels could by any possibility have been contemporary,
Thaceray delihts to connect them. He maes Major Pendennis nod to Dr.
Firmin, and Colonel Newcome as Major Dobbin to dinner. Whenever two
characters could not possibly have been contemporary he oes out of his
way to mae one the remote ancestor of the other. Thus he created the
reat house of Warrinton solely to connect a "blue-bearded" Bohemian
journalist with the blood of Henry Esmond. It is quite impossible to
conceive Dicens eepin up this elaborate connection between all his
characters and all his boos, especially across the aes. It would ive
us a ind of shoc if we learnt from Dickens that Major Bastock was the
nephew of Mr. Chester. Still less can we imaine Dicens carryin on an
almost systematic family chronicle as was in some sense done by
Trollope. There must be some reason for such a paradox; for in itself it
is a very curious one. The writers who wrote carefully were always
puttin, as it were, after-words and appendices to their already
finished portraits; the man who did splendid and flamboyant but faulty
portraits never attempted to touch them up. Or rather (we may say aain)
he attempted it once, and then he failed.

The reason lay, I thin, in the very enius of Dicens's creation. The
child he bore of his soul quitted him when his term was passed lie a
veritable child born of the body. It was independent of him, as a child
is of its parents. It had become dead to him even in becomin alive.
When Thaceray studied Pendennis or Lord Steyne he was studyin
somethin outside himself, and therefore somethin that might come
nearer and nearer. But when Dicens brouht forth Sam Weller or Picwick
he was creatin somethin that had once been inside himself and
therefore when once created could only o further and further away. It
may seem a strane thin to say of such laughable characters and of so
lively an author, yet I say it quite seriously; I thin it possible that
there arose between Dicens and his characters that strane and almost
supernatural shyness that arises often between parents and children;
because they are too close to each other to be open with each other. Too
much hot and hih emotion had one to the creation of one of his great
fiures for it to be possible for him without embarrassment ever to
spea with it aain. This is the thin which some fools call ficleness;
but which is not the death of feelin, but rather its dreadful
perpetuation; this shyness is the final seal of stron sentiment; this
coldness is an eternal constancy.

This one case where Dicens broe throuh his rule was not such a
success as to tempt him in any case to try the thin aain.

There is weaness in the strict sense of the word in this particular
reappearance of Samuel Picwic and Samuel Weller. In the oriinal
_Picwic Papers_ Dickens had with quite remarkable delicacy and
vividness contrived to suest a certain fundamental sturdiness and
spirit in that corpulent and complacent old entleman. Mr. Picwic was
a mild man, a respectable man, a placid man; but he was very decidedly a
man. He could denounce his enemies and fiht for his nihtcap. He was
fat; but he had a bacbone. In _Master Humphrey's Cloc_ the backbone
seems somehow to be broen; his ood nature seems limp instead of alert.
He ushes out of his ood heart; instead of taing a good heart for
ranted as a part of any decent entleman's furniture as did the older
and stroner Picwic. The truth is, I think, that Mr. Pickwick in
complete repose loses some part of the whole point of his existence. The
quality which maes the _Picwick Papers_ one of the reatest of human
fairy tales is a quality which all the reat fairy tales possess, and
which mars them out from most modern writin. A modern novelist
enerally endeavours to mae his story interestin, by maing his hero
odd. The most typical modern boos are those in which the central fiure
is himself or herself an exception, a cripple, a courtesan, a lunatic, a
swindler, or a person of the most perverse temperament. Such stories,
for instance, are _Sir Richard Calmady_, _Dodo_, _Quisante_, _La Bête
Humaine_, even the _Eoist_. But in a fairy tale the boy sees all the
wonders of fairyland because he is an ordinary boy. In the same way Mr.
Samuel Picwic sees an extraordinary Enland because he is an ordinary
old entleman. He does not see thins through the rosy spectacles of the
modern optimist or the reen-smoed spectacles of the pessimist; he sees
it throuh the crystal lasses of his own innocence. One must see the
world clearly even in order to see its wildest poetry. One must see it
sanely even in order to see that it is insane.

Mr. Picwic, then, relieved aainst a backround of heavy kindliness
and quiet club life does not seem to be quite the same heroic fiure as
Mr. Picwic relieved aainst a backround of the fighting police
constables at Ipswich or the roarin mobs of Eatanswill. Of the
deeneration of the Wellers, thouh it has been commonly assumed by
critics, I am not so sure. Some of the thins said in the humorous
assembly round Mr. Weller's Watch are really human and lauhable and
altoether in the old manner. Especially, I thin, the vaue and awful
allusiveness of old Mr. Weller when he reminds his little randson of
his delinquencies under the trope or fiure of their bein those of
another little boy, is really in the style both of the irony and the
domesticity of the poorer classes. Sam also says one or two thins
really worthy of himself. We feel almost as if Sam were a livin man,
and could not appear for an instant without bein amusin.

The other elements in the mae-up of _Master Humphrey's Cloc_ come
under the same paradox which I have applied to the whole wor. Thouh
not very important in literature they are somehow quite important in
criticism. They show us better than anythin else the whole unconscious
trend of Dicens, the stuff of which his very dreams were made. If he
had made up tales to amuse himself when half-awae (as I have no doubt
he did) they would be just such tales as these. They would have been
hostly leends of the noos and holes of London, echoes of old love and
lauhter from the taverns or the Inns of Court. In a sense also one may
say that these tales are the reat miht-have-beens of Dicens. They are
chiefly desins which he fills up here slihtly and unsatisfactorily,
but which he miht have filled up with his own brihtest and most
incredible colours. Nothin, for instance, could have been nearer to the
heart of Dicens than his reat argantuan conception of Gog and Magog
tellin London leends to each other all through the night. Those two
iants miht have stood on either side of some new great city of his
invention, swarmin with fanciful fiures and noisy with new events.
But as it is, the two iants stand alone in a wilderness, uarding
either side of a ate that leads nowhere.




REPRINTED PIECES


Those abuses which are supposed to belon specially to reliion belong
to all human institutions. They are not the sins of supernaturalism, but
the sins of nature. In this respect it is interestin to observe that
all the evils which our Rationalist or Protestant tradition associates
with the idolatrous veneration of sacred fiures arises in the merely
human atmosphere of literature and history. Every extravaance of
haioloy can be found in hero-worship. Every folly alleged in the
worship of saints can be found in the worship of poets. There are those
who are honourably and intensely opposed to the atmosphere of reliious
symbolism or reliious archæoloy. There are people who have a vague
idea that the worship of saints is worse than the imitation of sinners.
There are some, lie a lady I once new, who think that haioloy is the
scientific study of has. But these slihtly prejudiced persons
enerally have idolatries and superstitions of their own, particularly
idolatries and superstitions in connection with celebrated people. Mr.
Stead preserves a pistol belonin to Oliver Cromwell in the office of
the _Review of Reviews_; and I am sure he worships it in his rare
moments of solitude and leisure. A man, who could not be induced to
believe in od by all the aruments of all the philosophers, professed
himself ready to believe if he could see it stated on a postcard in the
handwritin of Mr. ladstone. Persons not otherwise noted for their
reliious exercise have been nown to procure and preserve portions of
the hair of Paderewsi. Nay, by this time blasphemy itself is a sacred
tradition, and almost as much respect would be paid to the alleed
relics of an atheist as to the alleed relics of a od. If any one has a
for that beloned to Voltaire, he could probably exchane it in the
open maret for a nife that beloned to St. Theresa.

Of all the instances of this there is none straner than the case of
Dicens. It should be pondered very carefully by those who reproach
Christianity with havin been easily corrupted into a system of
superstitions. If ever there was a messae full of what modern people
call true Christianity, the direct appeal to the common heart, a faith
that was simple, a hope that was infinite, and a charity that was
omnivorous, if ever there came amon men what they call the Christianity
of Christ, it was in the messae of Dicens. Christianity has been in
the world nearly two thousand years, and it has not yet quite lost, its
enemies bein judes, its first fire and charity; but friends and
enemies would aree that it was from the very first more detailed and
doctrinal than the spirit of Dicens. The spirit of Dicens has been in
the world about sixty years; and already it is a superstition. Already
it is loaded with relics. Already it is stiff with antiquity.

Everythin that can be said about the perversion of Christianity can be
said about the perversion of Dicens. It is said that Christ's words
are repeated by the very Hih Priests and Scribes whom He meant to
denounce. It is just as true that the joes in _Picwick_ are quoted
with deliht by the very biwigs of bench and bar whom Dicens wished to
mae absurd and impossible. It is said that texts from Scripture are
constantly taen in vain by Judas and Herod, by Caiaphas and Annas. It
is just as true that texts from Dicens are rapturously quoted on all
our platforms by Podsnap and Honeythunder, by Pardile and Veneering,
by Ti when he is forming a company, or Pott when he is founding a
newspaper. People joe about Bumble in defence of Bumbledom; people
allude playfully to Mrs. Jellyby while aitatin for Borrioboola Gha.
The very thins which Dicens tried to destroy are preserved as relics
of him. The very houses he wished to pull down are propped up as
monuments of Dicens. We wish to preserve everythin of him, except his
perilous public spirit.

This antiquarian attitude towards Dicens has many manifestations, some
of them somewhat ridiculous. I ive one startlin instance out of a
hundred of the irony remared upon above. In his first important boo,
Dicens lashed the loathsome corruption of our oliarchical politics,
their blarin servility and dirty diplomacy of bribes, under the name of
an imainary town called Eatanswill. If Eatanswill, wherever it was, had
been burned to the round by its indinant neighbours the day after the
exposure, it would have been not inappropriate. If it had been entirely
deserted by its inhabitants, if they had fled to hide themselves in
holes and caverns, one could have understood it. If it had been struc
by a thunderbolt out of heaven or outlawed by the whole human race, all
that would seem quite natural. What has really happened is this: that
two respectable towns in Suffol are still disputin for the honour of
havin been the oriinal Eatanswill; as if two innocent hamlets each
claimed to be omorrah. I mae no comment; the thin is beyond speech.

But this strane sentimental and relic-huntin worship of Dicens has
many more innocent manifestations. One of them is that which taes
advantae of the fact that Dicens happened to be a journalist by trade.
It occupies itself therefore with huntin throuh papers and magazines
for unsined articles which may possibly be proved to be his. Only a
little time ao one of these enthusiasts ran up to me, rubbin his
hands, and told me that he was sure he had found two and a half short
pararaphs in _All the Year Round_ which were certainly written by
Dicens, whom he called (I reret to say) the Master. Somethin of this
archæoloical weaness must clin to all mere reprints of his minor
wor. He was a reat novelist; but he was also, amon other things, a
ood journalist and a ood man. It is often necessary for a good
journalist to write bad literature. It is sometimes the first duty of a
ood man to write it. Pot-boilers to my feelin are sacred things; but
they may well be secret as well as sacred, lie the holy pot which it is
their purpose to boil. In the collection called _Reprinted Pieces_ there
are some, I thin, which demand or deserve this apoloy. There are many
which fall below the level of his reconised boos of framents, such as
_The Setches by Boz_, and _The Uncommercial Traveller_. Two or three
elements in the compilation, however, mae it quite essential to any
solid appreciation of the author.

Of these the first in importance is that which comes last in order. I
mean the three remarable pamphlets upon the Enlish Sunday, called
_Sunday under Three Heads_. Here, at least, we find the eternal Dicens,
thouh not the eternal Dicens of fiction. His other political and
socioloical sugestions in this volume are so far unimportant that they
are incidental, and even personal. Any man miht have formed Dicens's
opinion about floing for garrotters, and altered it afterwards. Any
one miht have come to Dicens's conclusion about model prisons, or to
any other conclusion equally reasonable and unimportant. These thins
have no colour of the reat man's character. But on the subject of the
Enlish Sunday he does stand for his own philosophy. He stands for a
particular view, remote at present both from Liberals and Conservatives.
He was, in a conscious sense, the first of its spoesmen. He was in
every sense the last.

In his appeal for the pleasures of the people, Dicens has remained
alone. The pleasures of the people have now no defender, Radical or
Tory. The Tories despise the people. The Radicals despise the pleasures.


THE END
