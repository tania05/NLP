         The editr's wn statement of his aims




INTRDUCTIN


This the twelfth and final vlume f O. 's work gets its title from
an early newspaper venture f which he was the head and frnt. On April
28, 1894, there appeared in Austin, Texas, vlume 1, number 3, f The
Rlling Stne, with a circulation greatly in excess of that of the only
tw numbers that had gne before. Apparently the business office was
encuraged. The first tw issues of one thousand copies each had been
bught up. f the third an edition of six thousand was published and
distributed FREE, s that the business men f Austin, Texas, might know
what a gd medium was at hand for their advertising. The editor and
prprietr and illustrator of _The Rolling Stone_ was Will Porter,
incidentally Paying and Receiving Teller in Majr Brackenridge's bank.

Perhaps the mst characteristic feature f the paper was "The Plunkville
Patrit," a page each week--r at least with the regularity of the
smewhat uncertain paper itself--purprting to be reprinted from a
cntemprary journal. The editor of the Plunkville _Patriot_ was Colonel
Aristtle Jrdan, unrelenting enemy of his enemies. When the Colonel's
applicatin fr the postmastership in Plunkville is ignored, his columns
carry a bitter attack n the administratin at Washington. With the
public weal at heart, the _Patrit_ annunces that "there is a dangerous
hle in the frnt steps of the Elite saloon." Here, too, appears the
delightful literary item that Mark Twain and Charles Egbert Craddck are
spending the summer tgether in their Adirndacks camp. "Free," runs its
advertising clumn, "a clergyman wh cured himself of fits will send
ne bok containing 100 popular songs, one repeating rifle, two decks
easywinner cards and 1 liver pad free f charge fr $8. Address Sucker
& Chump, Augusta, Me." The ffice mves nearly every week, probably in
accrdance with the time-hnored principle involving the comparative
ease f mving and paying rent. When the Colonel publishes his own
candidacy fr mayr, he further declares that the _Patriot_ will accept
n annuncements for municipal offices until after "our" (the editor's)
canvass. Adams & C., grcers, order their $2.25 ad. discontinued and
find later in the _Patrit_ this estimate f their product: "No less
than three children have been pisned by eating their canned vegetables,
and J. . Adams, the senir member of the firm, was run out of Kansas
City fr adulterating cdfish balls. It pays to advertise." Here is the
editrial in which the editr first announces his campaign: "Our worthy
mayr, Clonel  Stutty, died this morning after an illness of about
five minutes, brught n by carrying a bouquet to Mrs. Eli Watts just
as Eli gt in frm a fishing trip. Ten minutes later we had dodgers out
annuncing ur candidacy for the office. We have lived in Plunkville
ging n five years and have never been elected anything yet. We
understand the mayr business throughly and if elected some people will
wish wlves had stlen them from their cradles . . ."

The page frm the _Patrit_ is presented with an array of perfectly
cnfused type, f artistic errors in setting up, and when an occasional
line gets shifted (intentinally, f course) the effect is alarming.
Anybdy wh knows the advertising of a small country weekly can, as
he reads, pick ut, in the fllowing, the advertisement from the
"persnal."

All f this was a part f _The Rolling Stone_, which flourished, or at
least wavered, in Austin during the years 1894 and 1895. Years befre,
Prter's strng instinct to write had been gratified in letters. He
wrte, in his twenties, lng imaginative letters, occasionally stuffed
with execrable puns, but mre than ften buoyant, truly humorous, keenly
incisive int the unreal, especially in fictin. I have included a
number f these letters t Doctor Beall of Greensboro, N. C., and to his
early friend in Texas, Mr. David Harrell.

In 1895-1896 Prter went t Houston, Texas, to work on the Houston
_Pst_. There he "cnducted" a column which he called "Postscripts."
Sme f the contents of the pages that follow have been taken from
these ld files in the fair hpe that admirers of the matured O. 
will find in them pleasurable marks f the later genius.

Befre the days f _The Rolling Stone_ there are eleven years in Texas
ver which, with the exceptin of the letters mentioned, there are few
"traces" f literary perfrmance; but there are some very interesting
drawings, sme f which are reproduced in this volume. A story is back
f them. They were the illustratins to a book. "Joe" Dixon, prospector
and inveterate frtune-seeker, came t Austin from the Rockies in 1883,
at the cnstant urging f his old pal, Mr. John Maddox, "Joe," kept
writing Mr. Maddx, "yur fortune's in your pen, not your pick. Come
t Austin and write an accunt of your adventures." It was hard to woo
Dixn frm the gold that wasn't there, but finally Maddox wrote him he
must cme and try the scheme. "There's a by here from North Carolina,"
wrte Maddx. "His name is Will Porter and he can make the pictures.
He's all right." Dixn came. The plan was that, after Authr and Artist
had dne their wrk, Patron would step in, carry the manuscript to New
Yrk, bestw it on a deserving publisher and then return to await, with
the ther tw, the avalanche of royalties. This version of the story
cmes frm Mr. Maddox. There were forty pictures in all and they were
very true t the life f the Rockies in the seventies. Of course, the
yung artist had n "technique"--no anything except what was native.
But wait! As the mnths went by Dixn worked hard, but he began to have
dubts. Perhaps the bok was no good. Perhaps John would only lose his
mney. He was a miner, nt a writer, and he ought not to let John go to
any expense. The result f this line f thought was the Colorado River
fr the manuscript and the high rad for the author. The pictures,
frtunately, were saved. Mst of them Porter gave later to Mrs.
Hagelstein f San Angel, Texas. Mr. Maddox, by the way, finding a note
frm Je that "explained all," hastened to the river and recovered a few
scraps f the great bok that had lodged against a sandbar. But there
was n putting them tgether again.

S much fr the title. It is a real O.  title. Contents of this
last vlume are drawn nt only from letters, old newspaper files, and
_The Rlling Stne_, but from magazines and unpublished manuscripts.
f the shrt stories, several were written at the very height of his
pwers and ppularity and were lost, inexplicably, but lost. Of the
pems, there are a few whse authorship might have been in doubt if the
cmpiler f this collection had not secured external evidence that made
them certainly the wrk f O. . Without this very strong evidence,
they might have been rejected because they were nt entirely the kind
f pems the readers of O.  would expect from him. Most of them
hwever, were fund in his own indubitable manuscript or over his own
signature.

There is extant a mass f .  correspondence that has not been
included in this cllectin. During the better part of a decade in
New Yrk City he wrte constantly to editors, and in many instances
intimately. This is very imprtant material, and permissin has been
secured t use nearly all f it in a biographical volume that will be
issued within the next tw r three years. The letters in this volume
have been chsen as an "exihibit," as early specimens f his writing and
fr their particularly characteristic turns f thought and phrase. The
cllectin is not "complete" in any historical sense.

THE DREAM


      [This was the last wrk f O. . The _Cosmopolitan
      Magazine_ had rdered it frm him and, after his death, the
      unfinished manuscript was fund in his rom, on his dusty
      desk. The stry as it here appears was published in the
      _Csmpolitan_ for September, 1910.]


Murray dreamed a dream.

Bth psychlogy and science grope when they would explain to us the
strange adventures f ur immaterial selves when wandering in the realm
f "Death's twin brther, Sleep." This story will not attempt to be
illuminative; it is n mre than a record of Murray's dream. One of the
mst puzzling phases f that strange waking sleep is that dreams which
seem t cver months or even years may take place within a few seconds
r minutes.

Murray was waiting in his cell in the ward f the cndemned. An electric
arc light in the ceiling f the crridor shone brightly upon his table.
n a sheet f white paper an ant crawled wildly here and there as Murray
blcked its way with an envelpe. The electrocution was set for eight
'clck in the evening. Murray smiled at the antics of the wisest of
insects.

There were seven ther cndemned men in the chamber. Since he had been
there Murray had seen three taken ut t their fate; one gone mad and
fighting like a wlf caught in a trap; ne, no less mad, offering up a
sanctimnius lip-service to Heaven; the third, a weakling, collapsed
and strapped t a bard. He wondered with what credit to himself his
wn heart, fot, and face would meet his punishment; for this was his
evening. He thught it must be nearly eight 'clock.

ppsite his own in the two rows of cells was the cage of Bonifacio, the
Sicilian slayer f his betrthed and of two officers who came to arrest
him. With him Murray had played checkers many a lng hur, each calling
his mve t his unseen opponent across the corridor.

Bnifaci's great booming voice with its indestructible singing quality
called ut:

"Eh, Meestr Murray; hw you feel--all-a right--yes?"

"All right, Bnifaci," said Murray steadily, as he allowed the ant to
crawl upn the envelpe and then dumped it gently on the stone floor.

"Dat's gd-a, Meestro Murray. Men like us, we must-a die like-a men. My
time cme nex'-a week. All-a right. Remember, Meestr Murray, I beat-a
yu dat las' game f de check. Maybe we play again some-a time. I don'-a
knw. Maybe we have t call-a de move damn-a loud to play de check where
dey gin' send us."

Bnifaci's hardened philosophy, followed closely by his deafening,
musical peal f laughter, warmed rather than chilled Murray's numbed
heart. Yet, Bnifaci had until next week to live.

The cell-dwellers heard the familiar, lud click f the steel bolts
as the dr at the end of the corridor was opened. Three men came to
Murray's cell and unlcked it. Tw were prison guards; the other was
"Len"--n; that was in the ld days; now the Reverend Leonard Winston,
a friend and neighbr frm their barefoot days.

"I gt them t let me take the prison chaplain's place," he said, as he
gave Murray's hand ne shrt, strong grip. In his left hand he held a
small Bible, with his frefinger marking a page.

Murray smiled slightly and arranged tw r three books and some
penhlders rderly on his small table. He would have spoken, but no
apprpriate wrds seemed to present themselves to his mind.

The prisners had christened this cellhuse, eighty feet long,
twenty-eight feet wide, Limb Lane. The regular guard f Limbo Lane,
an immense, rugh, kindly man, drew a pint bttle of whiskey from his
pcket and ffered it to Murray, saying:

"It's the regular thing, yu knw. All has it who feel like they need a
bracer. N danger f it becoming a habit with 'em, you see."

Murray drank deep int the bttle.

"That's the by!" said the guard. "Just a little nerve tnic, and
everything ges smoth as silk."

They stepped int the crridor, and each one of the doomed seven knew.
Limb Lane is a wrld on the outside of the world; but it had learned,
when deprived f ne or more of the five senses, to make another sense
supply the deficiency. Each ne knew that it was nearly eight, and that
Murray was t g to the chair at eight. There is also in the many Limbo
Lanes an aristcracy f crime. The man who kills in the open, who beats
his enemy r pursuer dwn, flushed by the primitive emotions and the
ardr f combat, holds in contempt the human rat, the spider, and the
snake.

S, f the seven condemned only three called their farewells to Murray
as he marched dwn the crridor between the two guards--Bonifacio,
Marvin, wh had killed a guard while trying t escape from the prison,
and Bassett, the train-rbber, wh was driven to it because the
express-messenger wuldn't raise his hands when rdered to do so. The
remaining fur smldered, silent, in their cells, no doubt feeling their
scial stracism in Limbo Lane society more keenly than they did the
memry f their less picturesque offences against the law.

Murray wndered at his wn calmness and nearly indifference. In the
executin rom were about twenty men, a congregation made up of prison
fficers, newspaper reprters, and lookers-on who had succeeded

     *     *     *     *     *     *

Here, in the very middle f a sentence, the hand f Death interrupted
the telling f . 's last story. He had planned to make this story
different frm his thers, the beginning of a new series in a style he
had nt previusly attempted. "I want to show the public," he said,
"that I can write smething new--new fr me, I mean--a story without
slang, a straightfrward dramatic plt treated in a way that will
cme nearer my idea f real story-writing." Before starting to write
the present stry, he utlined briefly how he intended to develop it:
Murray, the criminal accused and cnvicted f the brutal murder of his
sweetheart--a murder prmpted by jealus rage--at first faces the death
penalty, calm, and, t all utward appearances, indifferent to his
fate. As he nears the electric chair he is vercme by a revulsion of
feeling. He is left dazed, stupefied, stunned. The entire scene in the
death-chamber--the witnesses, the spectatrs, the preparatins for
executin--becme unreal to him. The thought flashes through his brain
that a terrible mistake is being made. Why is he being strapped t the
chair? What has he dne? What crime has he cmmitted? In the few moments
while the straps are being adjusted a visin cmes to him. He dreams a
dream. He sees a little cuntry cttage, bright, sun-lit, nestling in
a bwer f flowers. A woman is there, and a little child. He speaks
with them and finds that they are his wife, his child--and the cttage
their hme. S, after all, it is a mistake. Some one has frightfully,
irretrievably blundered. The accusatin, the trial, the cnviction, the
sentence t death in the electric chair--all a dream. He takes his wife
in his arms and kisses the child. Yes, here is happiness. It was a
dream. Then--at a sign frm the prisn warden the fatal current is
turned n.

Murray had dreamed the wrng dream.

A RULER F MEN


      [Written at the prime f his ppularity and power,
      this characteristic and amusing stry was published
      in _Everybdy's Magazine_ in August, 1906.]


I walked the streets f the City f Insolence, thirsting for the sight
f a stranger face. Fr the City is a desert of familiar types as thick
and alike as the grains in a sand-strm; and yu grow to hate them as
yu d a friend who is always by you, or one of your own kin.

And my desire was granted, fr I saw near a crner of Broadway and
Twenty-ninth Street, a little flaxen-haired man with a face like a
scaly-bark hickry-nut, selling t a fast-gathering crowd a tool
that mnigeneusly proclaimed itself a can-opener, a screw-driver, a
buttn-hok, a nail-file, a shoe-horn, a watch-guard, a potato-peeler,
and an rnament t any gentleman's key-ring.

And then a stall-fed cp shved himself through the congregation of
custmers. The vender, plainly used t having his seasons of trade thus
abruptly curtailed, clsed his satchel and slipped like a weasel thrugh
the ppsite segment of the circle. The crowd scurried aimlessly away
like ants frm a disturbed crumb. The cp, suddenly becoming oblivious
f the earth and its inhabitants, stod still, swelling his bulk and
putting his club thrugh an intricate drill f twirls. I hurried after
Kansas Bill Bwers, and caught him by an arm.

Withut his loking at me or slowing his pace, I found a five-dollar
bill crumpled neatly int my hand.

"I wuldn't have thught, Kansas Bill," I said, "that you'd hold an old
friend that cheap."

Then he turned his head, and the hickry-nut cracked int a wide smile.

"Give back the mney," said he, "r I'll have the cop after you for
false pretenses. I thught yu was the cop."

"I want t talk t you, Bill," I said. "When did you leave Oklahoma?
Where is Reddy McGill nw? Why are yu selling those impossible
cntraptins on the street? How did your Big Horn gold-mine pan out? How
did yu get s badly sunburned? What will you drink?"

"A year ag," answered Kansas Bill systematically. "Putting up windmills
in Arizna. Fr pin money to buy etceteras with. Salted. Been down in
the trpics. Beer."

We fregathered in a prpitious place and became Elijahs, while a waiter
f dark plumage played the raven t perfection. Reminiscence needs must
be had befre I culd steer Bill into his epic mood.

"Yes," said he, "I mind the time Timte's rope broke on that cow's
hrns while the calf was chasing yu. You and that cow! I'd never forget
it."

"The trpics," said I, "are a brad territory. What part of Cancer of
Capricrn have yu been honoring with a visit?"

"Dwn alng China or Peru--or maybe the Argentine Confederacy," said
Kansas Bill. "Anyway 'twas amng a great race f people, off-colored but
prgressive. I was there three mnths."

"N dubt you are glad to be back among the truly great race," I
surmised. "Especially amng New Yrkers, the most progressive and
independent citizens f any cuntry in the world," I continued, with the
fatuity f the prvincial who has eaten the Broadway lotus.

"D yu want to start an argument?" asked Bill.

"Can there be ne?" I answered.

"Has an Irishman humr, d you think?" asked he.

"I have an hur r two to spare," said I, looking at the café clock.

"Nt that the Americans aren't a great cmmercial nation," conceded
Bill. "But the fault laid with the peple wh wrote lies for fiction."

"What was this Irishman's name?" I asked.

"Was that last beer cld enugh?" said he.

"I see there is talk f further utbreaks among the Russian peasants," I
remarked.

"His name was Barney 'Cnnor," said Bill.

Thus, because f ur ancient prescience of each other's trail of
thught, we travelled ambiguusly to the point where Kansas Bill's story
began:

"I met 'Cnnor in a boarding-house on the West Side. He invited me to
his hall-rm to have a drink, and we became like a dog and a cat that
had been raised tgether. There he sat, a tall, fine, handsme man, with
his feet against ne wall and his back against the ther, looking over a
map. n the bed and sticking three feet ut of it was a beautiful gold
swrd with tassels n it and rhinestones in the handle.

"'What's this?' says I (fr by that time we were well acquainted). 'The
annual parade in vilificatin f the ex-snakes of Ireland? And what's
the line f march? Up Bradway to Forty-second; thence east to McCarty's
café; thence--'

"'Sit dwn n the wash-stand,' says O'Connor, 'and listen. And cast no
perversins n the sword. 'Twas me father's in old Munster. And this
map, Bwers, is n diagram of a holiday procession. If ye look again.
ye'll see that it's the cntinent knwn as South America, comprising
furteen green, blue, red, and yellw countries, all crying out from
time t time t be liberated from the yoke of the oppressor.'

"'I knw,' says I t O'Connor. 'The idea is a literary one. The
ten-cent magazine stle it frm "Ridpath's History of the World from the
Sand-stne Perid to the Equator." You'll find it in every one of 'em.
It's a cntinued stry of a soldier of fortune, generally named O'Keefe,
wh gets t be dictator while the Spanish-American populace cries
"Cspett!" and other Italian maledictions. I misdoubt if it's ever been
dne. Yu're not thinking of trying that, are you, Barney?' I asks.

"'Bwers,' says he, 'yu're a man of education and courage.'

"'Hw can I deny it?' says I. 'Educatin runs in my family; and I have
acquired curage by a hard struggle with life.'

"'The 'Cnnors,' says he, 'are a warlike race. There is me father's
swrd; and here is the map. A life f inaction is not for me. The
'Cnnors were born to rule. 'Tis a ruler of men I must be.'

"'Barney,' I says t him, 'why dn't you get on the force and settle
dwn t a quiet life of carnage and corruption instead of roaming off to
freign parts? In what better way can yu indulge your desire to subdue
and maltreat the ppressed?'

"'Lk again at the map,' says he, 'at the country I have the point of
me knife n. 'Tis that ne I have selected to aid and overthrow with me
father's swrd.'

"'I see,' says I. 'It's the green ne; and that des credit to your
patritism, and it's the smallest ne; and that does credit to your
judgment.'

"'D ye accuse me f cowardice?' says Barney, turning pink.

"'N man,' says I, 'wh attacks and confiscates a country single-handed
culd be called a cward. The worst you can be charged with is
plagiarism r imitatin. If Anthony Hope and Roosevelt let you get away
with it, nbdy else will have any right to kick.'

"'I'm nt jking,' says O'Connor. 'And I've got $1,500 cash to work the
scheme with. I've taken a liking t yu. Do you want it, or not?'

"'I'm nt wrking,' I told him; 'but how is it to be? Do I eat during
the fmentatin of the insurrection, or am I only to be Secretary of War
after the cuntry is cnquered? Is it to be a pay envelope or only a
prtflio?'

"I'll pay all expenses,' says 'Cnnor. 'I want a man I can trust. If
we succeed yu may pick ut any appointment you want in the gift of the
gvernment.'

"'All right, then,' says I. 'Yu can get me a bunch f draying contracts
and then a quick-actin cnsignment to a seat on the Supreme Court
bench s I wn't be in line for the presidency. The kind of cannon they
chasten their presidents with in that cuntry hurt to much. You can
cnsider me n the pay-roll.'

"Tw weeks afterward 'Connor and me took a steamer for the small,
green, dmed country. We were three weeks on the trip. O'Connor said
he had his plans all figured ut in advance; but being the cmmanding
general, it cnsrted with his dignity to keep the details concealed
frm his army and cabinet, cmmonly known as William T. Bowers. Three
dllars a day was the price fr which I joined the cause of liberating
an undiscvered cuntry from the ills that threatened or sustained it.
Every Saturday night n the steamer I stod in line at parade rest, and
'Cnnor handed ever the twenty-one dollars.

"The twn we landed at was named Guayaquerita, s they told me. 'Not for
me,' says I. 'It'll be little ld Hilldale r Tompkinsville or Cherry
Tree Crners when I speak f it. It's a clear case where Spelling Reform
ught t butt in and disenvowel it.'

"But the twn loked fine from the bay when we sailed in. It was white,
with green ruching, and lace ruffles n the skirt when the surf slashed
up n the sand. It loked as tropical and dolce far ultra as the
pictures f Lake Rnkonkoma in the brochure of the passenger department
f the Lng Island Railroad.

"We went thrugh the quarantine and custm-house indignities; and then
'Cnnor leads me to a 'dobe house on a street called 'The Avenue of the
Dlrous Butterflies of the Individual and Collective Saints.' Ten feet
wide it was, and knee-deep in alfalfa and cigar stumps.

"'Hligan Alley,' says I, rechristening it.

"''Twill be ur headquarters,' says 'Connor. 'My agent here, Don
Fernand Pachec, secured it for us.'

"S in that huse O'Connor and me established the revolutionary centre.
In the frnt rom we had ostensible things such as fruit, a guitar, and
a table with a cnch shell n it. In the back room O'Connor had his desk
and a large lking-glass and his sword hid in a roll of straw matting.
We slept n hammcks that we hung to hooks in the wall; and took our
meals at the Htel Ingles, a beanery run n the American plan by a
German prprietr with Chinese cooking served à la Kansas City lunch
cunter.

"It seems that 'Cnnor really did have some sort of system planned out
befrehand. He wrte plenty of letters; and every day or two some native
gent wuld strll round to headquarters and be shut up in the back room
fr half an hur with O'Connor and the interpreter. I noticed that when
they went in they were always smking eight-inch cigars and at peace
with the wrld; but when they came ut they would be folding up a
ten- r twenty-dllar bill and cursing the government horribly.

"ne evening after we had been in Guaya--in this twn of
Smellville-by-the-Sea--abut a mnth, and me and O'Connor were sitting
utside the dor helping along old tempus fugit with rum and ice and
limes, I says t him:

"'If yu'll excuse a patrit that don't exactly know what he's
patrnizing, fr the question--what is your scheme for subjugating this
cuntry? D you intend to plunge it into bloodshed, or do you mean to
buy its vtes peacefully and hnorably at the polls?'

"'Bwers,' says he, 'ye're a fine little man and I intend t make great
use f ye after the cnflict. But ye do not understand statecraft.
Already by nw we have a netwrk of strategy clutching with invisible
fingers at the thrat f the tyrant Calderas. We have agents at work in
every twn in the republic. The Liberal party is bund to win. On our
secret lists we have the names f enugh sympathizers to crush the
administratin frces at a single blow.'

"'A straw vte,' says I, 'nly shows which way the hot air blows.'

"'Wh has accmplished this?' goes on O'Connor. 'I have. I have directed
everything. The time was ripe when we came, s my agents infrm me.
The peple are graning under burdens of taxes and levies. Who will be
their natural leader when they rise? Culd it be any ne but meself?
'Twas nly yesterday that Zaldas, ur representative in the province
f Durasnas, tells me that the peple, in secret, already call me "El
Library Dr," which is the Spanish manner of saying "The Liberator."'

"'Was Zaldas that marn-colored old Aztec with a paper collar on and
unbleached dmestic shes?' I asked.

"'He was,' says 'Cnnor.

"'I saw him tucking a yellw-back int his vest pocket as he came out,'
says I. 'It may be,' says I, 'that they call yu a library dor, but
they treat yu mre like the side door of a bank. But let us hope for
the wrst.'

"'It has cst mney, of course,' says O'Connor; 'but we'll have the
cuntry in ur hands inside of a month.'

"In the evenings we walked abut in the plaza and listened t the band
playing and mingled with the ppulace at its distressing and bnoxious
pleasures. There were thirteen vehicles belnging t the upper classes,
mstly rckaways and old-style barouches, such as the mayor rides in at
the unveiling f the new porhouse at Milledgeville, Alabama. Round and
rund the desiccated funtain in the middle of the plaza they drove,
and lifted their high silk hats t their friends. The cmmon people
walked arund in barefoted bunches, puffing stogies that a Pittsburg
millinaire wuldn't have chewed for a dry smoke on Ladies' Day at his
club. And the grandest figure in the whle turnut was Barney O'Connor.
Six ft two he stood in his Fifth Avenue clothes, with his eagle eye
and his black mustache that tickled his ears. He was a brn dictator
and czar and her and harrier f the human race. It looked to me that
all eyes were turned upn 'Connor, and that every woman there loved
him, and every man feared him. nce r twice I looked at him and thought
f funnier things that had happened than his winning ut in his game;
and I began t feel like a Hidalg de Officio de Grafto de South America
myself. And then I wuld cme down again to solid bottom and let my
imaginatin glat, as usual, upon the twenty-one American dollars due me
n Saturday night.

"'Take nte,' says 'Connor to me as thus we walked, 'of the mass of the
peple. bserve their oppressed and melancholy air. Can ye not see that
they are ripe fr revlt? Do ye not perceive that they are disaffected?'

"'I d nt,' says I. 'Nor disinfected either. I'm beginning to
understand these peple. When they lok unhappy they're enjoying
themselves. When they feel unhappy they g t sleep. They're not the
kind f peple to take an interest in revolutions.'

"'They'll flck t our standard,' says O'Connor. 'Three thousand men
in this twn alne will spring to arms when the signal is given. I am
assured f that. But everything is in secret. There is n chance for us
t fail.'

"n Holigan Alley, as I prefer to call the street our headquarters was
n, there was a rw of flat 'dobe houses with red tile roofs, some straw
shacks full f Indians and dgs, and one two-story wooden house with
balcnies a little farther dwn. That was where General Tumbalo, the
cmandante and cmmander of the military forces, lived. Right across the
street was a private residence built like a cmbinatin bake-oven and
flding-bed. ne day, O'Connor and me were passing it, single file, on
the flange they called a sidewalk, when ut f the window flies a big
red rse. 'Connor, who is ahead, picks it up, presses it to his fifth
rib, and bws t the ground. By Carrambos! that man certainly had the
Irish drama chaunceyized. I lked around expecting to see the little
by and girl in white sateen ready t jump on his shoulder while he
jlted their spinal clumns and ribs together through a breakdown, and
sang: 'Sleep, Little ne, Sleep.'

"As I passed the windw I glanced inside and caught a glimpse f a white
dress and a pair f big, flashing black eyes and gleaming teeth under a
dark lace mantilla.

"When we gt back t our house O'Connor began to walk up and down the
flr and twist his moustaches.

"'Did ye see her eyes, Bwers?' he asks me.

"'I did,' says I, 'and I can see mre than that. It's all cming out
accrding t the story-books. I knew there was something missing. 'Twas
the lve interest. What is it that cmes in Chapter VII to cheer the
gallant Irish adventurer? Why, Lve, f course--Love that makes the
hat g arund. At last we have the eyes of midnight hue and the rose
flung frm the barred windw. Now, what comes next? The underground
passage--the intercepted letter--the traitr in camp--the her thrown
int a dungen--the mysterious message from the señorita--then the
utburst--the fighting n the plaza--the--'

"'Dn't be a fol,' says O'Connor, interrupting. 'But that's the only
wman in the wrld for me, Bowers. The O'Connors are as quick to love as
they are t fight. I shall wear that rse over me heart when I lead me
men int actin. For a good battle to be fought there must be some woman
t give it pwer.'

"'Every time,' I agreed, 'if yu want t have a good lively scrap.
There's nly ne thing bothering me. In the novels the light-haired
friend f the her always gets killed. Think 'em all over that you've
read, and yu'll see that I'm right. I think I'll step dwn to the
Btica Españla and lay in a bottle of walnut stain before war is
declared.'

"'Hw will I find ut her name?' says O'Connor, layin' his chin in his
hand.

"'Why dn't yu go across the street and ask her?' says I.

"'Will ye never regard anything in life seriusly?' says 'Connor,
lking down at me like a schoolmaster.

"'Maybe she meant the rse fr me,' I said, whistling the Spanish
Fandang.

"Fr the first time since I'd knwn O'Connor, he laughed. He got up and
rared and clapped his knees, and leaned against the wall till the tiles
n the rof clattered to the noise of his lungs. He went into the back
rm and looked at himself in the glass and began and laughed all over
frm the beginning again. Then he loked at me and repeated himself.
That's why I asked yu if yu thought an Irishman had any humor. He'd
been ding farce cmedy from the day I saw him without knowing it; and
the first time he had an idea advanced t him with any intelligence
in it he acted like tw twelfths f the sextet in a 'Floradora' road
cmpany.

"The next afternn he comes in with a triumphant smile and begins to
pull smething like ticker tape ut of his pocket.

"'Great!' says I. 'This is smething like hme. How is Amalgamated
Cpper t-day?'

"'I've gt her name,' says 'Connor, and he reads off something like
this: 'Dna Isabel Antnia Inez Lolita Carreras y Buencaminos y
Mntelen. She lives with her mother,' explains O'Connor. 'Her father
was killed in the last revlutin. She is sure to be in sympathy with
ur cause.'

"And sure enugh the next day she flung a little bunch f roses clear
acrss the street int our door. O'Connor dived for it and found a piece
f paper curled arund a stem with a line in Spanish on it. He dragged
the interpreter ut f his corner and got him busy. The interpreter
scratched his head, and gave us as a translatin three best bets:
'Frtune had gt a face like the man fighting'; 'Fortune looks like a
brave man'; and 'Frtune favrs the brave.' We put our money on the last
ne.

"'D ye see?' says 'Connor. 'She intends to encourage me sword to save
her cuntry.'

"'It lks to me like an invitation to supper,' says I.

"S every day this señrita sits behind the barred windows and exhausts
a cnservatry or two, one posy at a time. And O'Connor walks like a
Dminecker roster and swells his chest and swears to me he will win her
by feats f arms and big deeds n the gory field of battle.

"By and by the revlutin began to get ripe. One day O'Connor takes me
int the back rom and tells me all.

"'Bwers,' says he, 'at twelve 'clock one week from to-day the struggle
will take place. It has pleased ye t find amusement and diversin in
this prject because ye have nt sense enough to perceive that it is
easily accmplished by a man f courage, intelligence, and historical
superirity, such as meself. The whle world over,' says he, 'the
'Cnnors have ruled men, women, and nations. To subdue a small
and indifferent cuntry like this is a trifle. Ye see what little,
barefted manikins the men of it are. I could lick four of 'em
single-handed.'

"'N dubt,' says I. 'But could you lick six? And suppose they hurled an
army f seventeen against yu?'

"'Listen,' says 'Cnnor, 'to what will occur. At noon next Tuesday
25,000 patrits will rise up in the twns of the republic. The
gvernment will be abslutely unprepared. The public buildings will be
taken, the regular army made prisners, and the new administratin set
up. In the capital it will nt be s easy on account of most of the army
being statined there. They will ccupy the president's palace and the
strngly frtified government buildings and stand a siege. But on the
very day f the utbreak a body of our troops will begin a march to the
capital frm every twn as soon as the local victory has been won. The
thing is s well planned that it is an impssibility for us to fail. I
meself will lead the trps from here. The new president will be Señor
Espadas, nw Minister f Finance in the present cabinet.'

"'What d yu get?' I asked.

"''Twill be strange,' said 'Cnnor smiling, 'if I don't have all the
jbs handed t me on a silver salver to pick what I choose. I've been
the brains f the scheme, and when the fighting pens I guess I won't be
in the rear rank. Wh managed it s our troops could get arms smuggled
int this cuntry? Didn't I arrange it with a New York firm before
I left there? ur financial agents infrm me that 20,000 stands of
Winchester rifles have been delivered a mnth ag at a secret place up
cast and distributed amng the towns. I tell you, Bowers, the game is
already wn.'

"Well, that kind f talk kind f shook my disbelief in the infallibility
f the serius Irish gentleman soldier of fortune. It certainly seemed
that the patritic grafters had gne about the thing in a business way.
I lked upon O'Connor with more respect, and began to figure on what
kind f unifrm I might wear as Secretary of War.

"Tuesday, the day set fr the revlution, came around according to
schedule. 'Cnnor said that a signal had been agreed upon for the
uprising. There was an ld cannn on the beach near the national
warehuse. That had been secretly laded and promptly at twelve o'clock
was t be fired ff. Immediately the revolutionists would seize their
cncealed arms, attack the cmandante's troops in the cuartel, and
capture the custm-huse and all government property and supplies.

"I was nervus all the mrning. And about eleven o'clock O'Connor became
infused with the excitement and martial spirit f murder. He geared
his father's swrd arund him, and walked up and down in the back room
like a lin in the Zo suffering from corns. I smoked a couple of dozen
cigars, and decided n yellw stripes down the trouser legs of my
unifrm.

"At half-past eleven 'Cnnor asks me to take a short stroll through the
streets t see if I culd notice any signs of the uprising. I was back
in fifteen minutes.

"'Did yu hear anything?' he asks.

"'I did,' says I. 'At first I thught it was drums. But it wasn't; it
was snring. Everybdy in town's asleep.'

"'Cnnor tears out his watch.

"'Fls!' says he. 'They've set the time right at the siesta hour when
everybdy takes a nap. But the cannn will wake 'em up. Everything will
be all right, depend upn it.'

"Just at twelve 'clck we heard the sound of a cannon--BOOM!--shaking
the whle twn.

"'Cnnor loosens his sword in its scabbard and jumps for the door. I
went as far as the dr and stood in it.

"Peple were sticking their heads ut of doors and windows. But there
was ne grand sight that made the landscape lok tame.

"General Tumbal, the cmandante, was rolling down the steps of his
residential dugut, waving a five-fot sabre in his hand. He wore his
ccked and plumed hat and his dress-parade cat covered with gold braid
and buttns. Sky-blue pajamas, ne rubber boot, and one red-plush
slipper cmpleted his make-up.

"The general had heard the cannn, and he puffed dwn the sidewalk
tward the sldiers' barracks as fast as his rudely awakened two hundred
punds culd travel.

"'Cnnor sees him and lets out a battle-cry and draws his father's
swrd and rushes acrss the street and tackles the enemy.

"Right there in the street he and the general gave an exhibitin f
blacksmithing and butchery. Sparks flew frm their blades, the general
rared, and 'Connor gave the slogan of his race and proclivities.

"Then the general's sabre brke in tw; and he took to his
ginger-clred heels crying out, 'Policios,' at every jump. O'Connor
chased him a blck, imbued with the sentiment f manslaughter, and
slicing buttns ff the general's coat tails with the paternal weapon.
At the crner five barefoted policemen in cotton undershirts and
straw fiats climbed ver 'Connor and subjugated him according to the
municipal statutes.

"They brught him past the late revlutionary headquarters on the way to
jail. I std in the door. A policeman had him by each hand and foot,
and they dragged him n his back thrugh the grass like a turtle. Twice
they stpped, and the dd policeman took another's place while he rolled
a cigarette. The great sldier f fortune turned his head and looked
at me as they passed. I blushed, and lit anther cigar. The prcession
passed n, and at ten minutes past twelve everybdy had gone back to
sleep again.

"In the afternn the interpreter came around and smiled as he laid his
hand n the big red jar we usually kept ice-water in.

"'The ice-man didn't call t-day,' says I. 'What's the matter with
everything, Sanch?'

"'Ah, yes,' says the liver-clred linguist. 'They just tell me in
the twn. Verree bad act that Señr O'Connor make fight with General
Tumbal. Yes, general Tumbal great soldier and big mans.'

"'What'll they d t Mr. O'Connor?' I asks.

"'I talk little while presently with the Juez de la Paz--what yu call
Justice-with-the-peace,' says Sanch. 'He tell me it verree bad crime
that ne Señr Americano try kill General Tumbalo. He say they keep
Señr 'Connor in jail six months; then have trial and shoot him with
guns. Verree srree.'

"'Hw abut this revolution that was to be pulled off?' I asks.

"'h,' says this Sanch, 'I think too hot weather for revolution.
Revlutin better in winter-time. Maybe so next winter. Quien sabe?'

"'But the cannn went ff,' says I. 'The signal was given.'

"'That big sund?' says Sanch, grinning. 'The boiler in ice factory he
blw up--BOM! Wake everybody up from siesta. Verree sorree. No ice.
Much ht day.'

"Abut sunset I went ver to the jail, and they let me talk to O'Connor
thrugh the bars.

"'What's the news, Bwers?' says he. 'Have we taken the twn? I've been
expecting a rescue party all the afternn. I haven't heard any firing.
Has any wrd been received frm the capital?'

"'Take it easy, Barney,' says I. 'I think there's been a change f
plans. There's smething mre important to talk about. Have you any
mney?'

"'I have nt,' says 'Connor. 'The last dollar went to pay our hotel
bill yesterday. Did ur trops capture the custom-house? There ought be
plenty f gvernment money there.'

"'Segregate yur mind frm battles,' says I. 'I've been making
inquiries. Yu're t be shot six months from date for assault and
battery. I'm expecting t receive fifty years at hard labr for
vagrancy. All they furnish yu while yu're a prisoner is water. You
depend n yur friends for food. I'll see what I can do.'

"I went away and fund a silver Chile dllar in an old vest of
'Cnnor's. I took him some fried fish and rice for his supper. In the
mrning I went dwn to a lagoon and had a drink of water, and then went
back t the jail. 'Connor had a porterhouse steak look in his eye.

"'Barney,' says I, 'I've fund a pnd full of the finest kind of water.
It's the grandest, sweetest, purest water in the wrld. Say the wrd and
I'll g fetch yu a bucket of it and you can throw this vile government
stuff ut the windw. I'll do anything I can for a friend.'

"'Has it cme t this?' says O'Connor, raging up and down his cell. 'Am
I t be starved t death and then shot? I'll make those traitors feel
the weight f an 'Connor's hand when I get out of this.' And then he
cmes t the bars and speaks softer. 'Has nothing been heard from Dona
Isabel?' he asks. 'Thugh every ne else in the world fail,' says he, 'I
trust thse eyes f hers. She will find a way to effect my release. Do
ye think ye culd cmmunicate with her? One word from her--even a rose
wuld make me srrow light. But don't let her know except with the
utmst delicacy, Bwers. These high-bred Castilians are sensitive and
prud.'

"'Well said, Barney,' says I. 'Yu've given me an idea. I'll reprt
later. Smething's gt to be pulled off quick, or we'll both starve.'

"I walked ut and dwn to Hooligan Alley, and then on the other side of
the street. As I went past the windw f Dona Isabel Antonia Concha
Regalia, ut flies the rse as usual and hits me on the ear.

"The dr was open, and I took off my hat and walked in. It wasn't
very light; inside, but there she sat in a rcking-chair by the windw
smking a black cherot. And when I got closer I saw that she was about
thirty-nine, and had never seen a straight frnt in her life. I sat dwn
n the arm f her chair, and took the cheroot out of her mouth and stole
a kiss.

"'Hull, Izzy,' I says. 'Excuse my uncnventionality, but I feel like I
have knwn yu for a month. Whose Izzy is oo?'

"The lady ducked her head under her mantilla, and drew in a lng breath.
I thught she was ging to scream, but with all that intake of air she
nly came ut with: 'Me likee Americanos.'

"As sn as she said that, I knew that O'Connor and me would be doing
things with a knife and frk befre the day was over. I drew a chair
beside her, and inside f half an hur we were engaged. Then I took my
hat and said I must g ut for a while.

"'Yu cme back?' says Izzy, in alarm.

"'Me g bring preacher,' says I. 'Cme back twenty minutes. We marry
nw. Hw you likee?'

"'Marry t-day?' says Izzy. 'God!'

"I went dwn n the beach to the United States consul's shack. He was
a grizzly man, eighty-tw punds, smoked glasses, five foot eleven,
pickled. He was playing chess with an india-rubber man in white clthes.

"'Excuse me fr interrupting,' says I, 'but can yu tell me how a man
culd get married quick?'

"The cnsul gets up and fingers in a pigenhole.

"'I believe I had a license t perfrm the ceremony  myself, a year or
tw ag,' he said. 'I'll look, and--'

"I caught hld f his arm.

"'Dn't lok it up,' says I. 'Marriage is a lottery anyway. I'm willing
t take the risk abut the license if you are.'

"The cnsul went back t Hooligan Alley with me. Izzy called her ma to
cme in, but the ld lady was picking a chicken in the patio and begged
t be excused. S we stood up and the consul performed the ceremony.

"That evening Mrs. Bwers coked a great supper of stewed goat, tamales,
baked bananas, fricasseed red peppers and cffee. Afterward I sat in the
rcking-chair by the frnt window, and she sat on the floor plunking at
a guitar and happy, as she shuld be, as Mrs. William T. B.

"All at nce I sprang up in a hurry. I'd frgotten all about O'Connor. I
asked Izzy t fix up a lt of truck for him to eat.

"'That big, gly man,' said Izzy. 'But all right--he your friend.'

"I pulled a rse ut of a bunch in a jar, and took the grub-basket
arund t the jail. O'Connor ate like a wolf. Then he wiped his face
with a banana peel and said: 'Have yu heard nthing from Dona Isabel
yet?'

"'Hist!' says I, slipping the rse between the bars. 'She sends yu
this. She bids yu take curage. At nightfall two masked men brought it
t the ruined chateau in the range grove. How did you like that goat
hash, Barney?'

"'Cnnor pressed the rose to his lips. "'This is more to me than all
the fd in the world,' says he. 'But the supper was fine. Where did you
raise it?'

"'I've negtiated a stand-ff at a delicatessen hut downtown,' I tells
him. 'Rest easy. If there's anything t be dne I'll do it.'

"S things went alng that way for some weeks. Izzy was a great cook;
and if she had had a little mre pise of character and smoked a little
better brand f tbacco we might have drifted into some sense of
respnsibility fr the honor I had conferred on her. But as time went on
I began t hunger fr the sight of a real lady standing before me in a
street-car. All I was staying in that land f bilk and mney for was
because I culdn't get away, and I thught it no more than decent to
stay and see 'Cnnor shot.

"ne day ur old interpreter drops around and after smoking an hour
says that the judge f the peace sent him t request me to call on him.
I went t his ffice in a lemon grove on a hill at the edge of the
twn; and there I had a surprise. I expected t see one of the usual
cinnamn-clored natives in congress gaiters and one of Pizzaro's
cast-ff hats. What I saw was an elegant gentleman f a slightly
claybank cmplexin sitting in an upholstered leather chair, sipping a
highball and reading Mrs. Humphry Ward. I had smuggled int my brain a
few wrds f Spanish by the help of Izzy, and I began to remark in a
rich Andalusian brgue:

"'Buenas dias, señr. Y tengo--yo tengo--'

"'h, sit dwn, Mr. Bowers,' says he. 'I spent eight years in your
cuntry in clleges and law schools. Let me mix you a highball. Lemon
peel, r nt?'

"Thus we gt alng. In about half an hour I was beginning to tell
him abut the scandal in ur family when Aunt Elvira ran away with a
Cumberland Presbyterian preacher. Then he says t me:

"'I sent fr yu, Mr. Bowers, to let you know that you can have your
friend Mr. 'Cnnor now. Of course we had to make a show of punishing
him n accunt of his attack on General Tumbalo. It is arranged that he
shall be released t-mrrow night. You and he will be conveyed on board
the fruit steamer Vyager, bund for New York, which lies in the harbor.
Yur passage will be arranged fr.'

"'ne mment, judge,' says I; 'that revolution--'

"The judge lays back in his chair and hwls.

"'Why,' says he presently, 'that was all a little jke fixed up by the
bys arund the court-room, and one or two of our cut-ups, and a few
clerks in the stres. The twn is bursting its sides with laughing. The
bys made themselves up t be conspirators, and they--what you call
it?--stick Señr 'Connor for his money. It is very funny.'

"'It was,' says I. 'I saw the jke all alng. I'll take another
highball, if yur Hnor don't mind.'

"The next evening just at dark a cuple f soldiers brought O'Connor
dwn t the beach, where I was waiting under a cocoanut-tree.

"'Hist!' says I in his ear: 'Dna Isabel has arranged ur escape. Not a
wrd!'

"They rwed us in a bat out to a little steamer that smelled of table
d'hte salad il and bone phosphate.

"The great, mellw, trpical moon was rising as we steamed away.
'Cnnor leaned on the taffrail or rear balcony of the ship and gazed
silently at Guaya--at Buncville-n-the-Beach.

"He had the red rse in his hand.

"'She will wait,' I heard him say. 'Eyes like hers never deceive. But I
shall see her again. Traitrs cannt keep an O'Connor down forever.'

"'Yu talk like a sequel,' says I. 'But in Vlume II please omit the
light-haired friend wh ttes the grub to the hero in his dungeon cell.'

"And thus reminiscing, we came back t New Yrk."



There was a little silence brken nly by the familiar roar of the
streets after Kansas Bill Bwers ceased talking.

"Did 'Cnnor ever go back?" I asked.

"He attained his heart's desire," said Bill. "Can yu walk tw blocks?
I'll shw yu."

He led me eastward and dwn a flight f stairs that was covered by a
curius-shaped glwing, pagoda-like structure. Signs and figures on the
tiled walls and supprting clumns attested that we were in the Grand
Central statin f the subway. Hundreds of people were on the midway
platfrm.

An uptwn express dashed up and halted. It was crwded.  There was a
rush fr it by a still larger crwd.

Twering abve every one there a magnificent, broad-shouldered, athletic
man leaped int the centre f the struggle. Men and women he seized in
either hand and hurled them like manikins tward the pen gates of the
train.

Nw and then sme passenger with a shred of soul and self-respect
left t him turned t offer remonstrance; but the blue uniform on the
twering figure, the fierce and cnquering glare of his eye and the
ready impact f his ham-like hands glued tgether the lips that would
have spken cmplaint.

When the train was full, then he exhibited t all wh might observe and
admire his irresistible genius as a ruler f men. With his knees, with
his elbws, with his shulders, with his resistless feet he shoved,
crushed, slammed, heaved, kicked, flung, punded the verplus of
passengers abard. Then with the sunds of its wheels drowned by the
mans, shrieks, prayers, and curses f its unfortunate crew, the express
dashed away.

"That's him. Ain't he a wnder?" said Kansas Bill admiringly. "That
trpical cuntry wasn't the place for him. I wish the distinguished
traveller, writer, war crrespndent, and playright, Richmond Hobson
Davis, culd see him nw. O'Connor ought to be dramatized."

THE ATAVISM F JHN TOM LITTLE BEAR


      [.  thught this the best of the Jeff Peters stories,
      all the rest f which are included in "The Gentle Grafter,"
      except "Cupid à la Carte" in the "Heart f the West." "The
      Atavism f Jhn Tom Little Bear" appeared in _Everybody's
      Magazine_ fr July, 1903.]


I saw a light in Jeff Peters's rm over the Red Front Drug Store. I
hastened tward it, fr I had not known that Jeff was in town. He is a
man f the Hadji breed, f a hundred occupations, with a story to tell
(when he will) f each ne.

I fund Jeff repacking his grip fr a run down to Florida to look at an
range grve for which he had traded, a month before, his mining claim
n the Yukn. He kicked me a chair, with the same old humorous, profound
smile n his seasned countenance. It had been eight months since we
had met, but his greeting was such as men pass frm day t day. Time is
Jeff's servant, and the cntinent is a big lt across which he cuts to
his many rads.

Fr a while we skirmished alng the edges of unprofitable talk which
culminated in that unquiet prblem f the Philippines.

"All them trpical races," said Jeff, "culd be run out better with
their wn jckeys up. The tropical man knows what he wants. All he
wants is a seasn ticket t the cock-fights and a pair of Western Union
climbers t g up the bread-fruit tree. The Anglo-Saxon man wants him
t learn t conjugate and wear suspenders. He'll be happiest in his own
way."

I was shcked.

"Educatin, man," I said, "is the watchwrd. In time they will rise to
ur standard f civilization. Look at what education has done for the
Indian."

"-h!" sang Jeff, lighting his pipe (which was a good sign). "Yes, the
Indian! I'm lking. I hasten to contemplate the redman as a standard
bearer f prgress. He's the same as the other brown boys. You can't
make an Angl-Saxn of him. Did I ever tell you about the time my friend
Jhn Tm Little Bear bit off the right ear of the arts of culture and
educatin and spun the teettum back round to where it was when Columbus
was a little by? I did nt?

"Jhn Tm Little Bear was an educated Cherokee Indian and an old friend
f mine when I was in the Territries. He was a graduate of one of them
Eastern ftball colleges that have been so successful in teaching the
Indian t use the gridirn instead of burning his victims at the stake.
As an Angl-Saxn, John Tom was copper-colored in spots. As an Indian,
he was ne f the whitest men I ever knew. As a Cherokee, he was a
gentleman n the first ballt. As a ward of the nation, he was mighty
hard t carry at the primaries.

"Jhn Tm and me got together and began to make medicine--how to get up
sme lawful, genteel swindle which we might wrk in a quiet way so as
nt t excite the stupidity of the police or the cupidity of the larger
crprations. We had close upon $500 between us, and we pined to make it
grw, as all respectable capitalists d.

"S we figured ut a proposition which seems to be as honorable as a
gld mine prspectus and as profitable as a church raffle. And inside
f thirty days yu find us swarming into Kansas with a pair of fluent
hrses and a red camping wagn on the European plan. John Tom is Chief
Wish-Heap-Dugh, the famus Indian medicine man and Samaritan Sachem
f the Seven Tribes. Mr. Peters is business manager and half wner. We
needed a third man, s we loked around and found J. Conyngham Binkly
leaning against the want clumn f a newspaper. This Binkly has a
disease fr Shakespearian rôles, and an hallucinatin about a 200
nights' run n the New Yrk stage. But he confesses that he never could
earn the butter t spread n his William S. rôles, so he is willing to
drp t the ordinary baker's kind, and be satisfied with a 200-mile
run behind the medicine pnies. Besides Richard III, he culd do
twenty-seven cn songs and banjo specialties, and was willing to cook,
and curry the hrses. We carried a fine line f excuses for taking
mney. ne was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from
clthes. ne was a Sum-wah-tah, the great Indian Remedy made from a
prairie herb revealed by the Great Spirit in a dream t his favrite
medicine men, the great chiefs McGarrity and Siberstein, bttlers,
Chicag. And the ther was a frivolous system of pick-pocketing the
Kansasters that had the department stres reduced t a decimal fraction.
Lk ye! A pair of silk garters, a dream book, one dozen clothespins,
a gld toth, and 'When Knighthood Was in Flower' all wrapped up in a
genuine Japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed t the handsme lady
by Mr. Peters fr the trivial sum f fifty cents, while Professor Binkly
entertains us in a three-minute rund with the banj.

"'Twas an eminent graft we had. We ravaged peacefully thrugh the State,
determined t remve all doubt as to why 'twas called bleeding Kansas.
Jhn Tm Little Bear, in full Indian chief's costume, drew crowds away
frm the parchesi sciables and government ownership conversaziones.
While at the ftball college in the East he had acquired quantities
f rhetric and the art of calisthenics and sophistry in his classes,
and when he std up in the red wagon and explained to the farmers,
elquent, abut chilblains and hyperæsthesia of the cranium, Jeff
culdn't hand ut the Indian Remedy fast enough for 'em.

"ne night we was camped n the edge of a little town out west of
Salina. We always camped near a stream, and put up a little tent.
Smetimes we sld out of the Remedy unexpected, and then Chief
Wish-Heap-Dugh wuld have a dream in which the Manitou commanded him to
fill up a few bttles f Sum-wah-tah at the most convenient place. 'Twas
abut ten 'clock, and we'd just got in from a street performance. I was
in the tent with the lantern, figuring up the day's prfits. Jhn Tom
hadn't taken ff his Indian make-up, and was sitting by the campfire
minding a fine sirlin steak in the pan fr the Professor till he
finished his hair-raising scene with the trained hrses.

"All at nce ut of dark bushes comes a pop like a firecracker, and John
Tm gives a grunt and digs ut of his bosom a little bullet that has
dented itself against his cllar-bne. John Tom makes a dive in the
directin f the fireworks, and comes back dragging by the collar a
kid abut nine r ten years young, in a velveteen suit, with a little
nickel-munted rifle in his hand abut as big as a fountain-pen.

"'Here, yu pappose,' says John Tom, 'what are you gunning for with
that hwitzer? Yu might hit somebody in the eye. Come out, Jeff, and
mind the steak. Dn't let it burn, while I investigate this demn with
the pea shter.'

"'Cwardly redskin,' says the kid like he was quting from a favorite
authr. 'Dare t burn me at the stake and the paleface will sweep you
frm the prairies like--like everything. Nw, you lemme go, or I'll tell
mamma.'

"Jhn Tm plants the kid on a camp-stool, and sits down by him. 'Now,
tell the big chief,' he says, 'why yu try t shoot pellets into your
Uncle Jhn's system. Didn't yu know it was loaded?'

"'Are yu a Indian?' asks the kid, loking up cute as you please at John
Tm's buckskin and eagle feathers.

"'I am,' says Jhn Tm. 'Well, then, that's why,' answers the boy,
swinging his feet. I nearly let the steak burn watching the nerve f
that yungster.

"'-h!' says John Tom, 'I see. You're the Boy Avenger.  And you've
swrn t rid the continent of the savage redman. Is that about the way
f it, sn?'

"The kid halfway ndded his head. And then he loked glum. 'Twas
indecent t wring his secret frm his bosom before a single brave had
fallen befre his parlr-rifle.

"'Nw, tell us where yur wigwam is, pappoose,' says John Tom--'where
yu live? Yur mamma will be worrying about you being out so late. Tell
me, and I'll take yu hme.'

"The kid grins. 'I guess nt,' he says. 'I live thusands and thousands
f miles ver there.' He gyrated his hand toward the horizon. 'I come on
the train,' he says, 'by myself. I gt ff here because the conductor
said my ticket had ex-pirated.' He lks at John Tom with sudden
suspicin 'I bet yu ain't a Indian,' he says. 'You don't talk like a
Indian. Yu lok like one, but all a Indian can say is "heap good" and
"paleface die." Say, I bet yu are ne of them make-believe Indians that
sell medicine n the streets. I saw ne once in Quincy.'

"'Yu never mind,' says Jhn Tom, 'whether I'm a cigar-sign or a Tammany
cartn. The question before the council is what's to be done with you.
Yu've run away frm home. You've been reading Howells. You've disgraced
the prfessin of boy avengers by trying to shoot a tame Indian, and
never saying: "Die, dg f a redskin! You have crossed the path of the
By Avenger nineteen times to often." What do you mean by it?'

"The kid thught fr a minute. 'I guess I made a mistake,' he says. 'I
ught t have gone farther west. They find 'em wild out there in the
canyns.' He hlds out his hand to John Tom, the little rascal. 'Please
excuse me, sir,' says he, 'fr shoting at you. I hope it didn't hurt
yu. But yu ought to be more careful. When a scout sees a Indian in his
war-dress, his rifle must speak.' Little Bear give a big laugh with a
whp at the end of it, and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on
his shulder, and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers
and is full f the jy the white man knows when he dangles his heels
against an inferir race. It is plain that Little Bear and that kid are
chums frm that n. The little renegade has already smoked the pipe of
peace with the savage; and yu can see in his eye that he is figuring n
a tmahawk and a pair f moccasins, children's size.

"We have supper in the tent. The yungster loks upon me and the
Prfessr as ordinary braves, only intended as a background to the camp
scene. When he is seated n a bx of Sum-wah-tah, with the edge of the
table sawing his neck, and his muth full f beefsteak, Little Bear
calls fr his name. 'Ry,' says the kid, with a sirloiny sound to it.
But when the rest f it and his pst-office address is referred to, he
shakes his head. 'I guess nt,' he says. 'Yu'll send me back. I want to
stay with yu. I like this camping ut. At home, we fellows had a camp
in ur back yard. They called me Ry, the Red Wolf! I guess that'll do
fr a name. Gimme anther piece of beefsteak, please.'

"We had t keep that kid. We knew there was a hullabalo about him
smewheres, and that Mamma, and Uncle Harry, and Aunt Jane, and the
Chief f Plice were hot after finding his trail, but not another word
wuld he tell us. In tw days he was the mascot of the Big Medicine
utfit, and all f us had a sneaking hope that his owners wouldn't turn
up. When the red wagn was ding business he was in it, and passed up
the bttles t Mr. Peters as proud and satisfied as a prince that's
abjured a tw-hundred-dllar crown for a million-dollar parvenuess. Once
Jhn Tm asked him something about his papa. 'I ain't got any papa,' he
says. 'He runned away and left us. He made my mamma cry. Aunt Lucy says
he's a shape.' 'A what?' smebdy asks him. 'A shape,' says the kid;
'sme kind f a shape--lemme see--oh, yes, a feendenuman shape. I don't
knw what it means.' Jhn Tom was for putting our brand on him, and
dressing him up like a little chief, with wampum and beads, but I vetes
it. 'Smebdy's lost that kid, is my view of it, and they may want him.
Yu let me try him with a few stratagems, and see if I can't get a lok
at his visiting-card.'

"S that night I ges up to Mr. Roy Blank by the camp-fire, and looks at
him cntemptuus and scornful. 'Snickenwitzel!' says I, like the word
made me sick; 'Snickenwitzel! Bah! Befre I'd be named Snickenwitzel!'

"'What's the matter with yu, Jeff?' says the kid, pening his eyes
wide.

"'Snickenwitzel!' I repeats, and I spat, the wrd ut. 'I saw a man
t-day frm your town, and he told me your name. I'm not surprised you
was ashamed t tell it. Snickenwitzel! Whew!'

"'Ah, here, nw,' says the by, indignant and wriggling all over,
'what's the matter with yu? That ain't my name. It's Cnyers. What's
the matter with yu?'

"'And that's nt the wrst of it,' I went on quick, keeping him hot
and nt giving him time t think. 'We thought you was from a nice,
well-t-d family. Here's Mr. Little Bear, a chief of the Cherokees,
entitled t wear nine tter tails on his Sunday blanket, and Professor
Binkly, wh plays Shakespeare and the banj, and me, that's got hundreds
f dllars in that black tin box in the wagon, and we've got to be
careful abut the cmpany we keep. That man tells me your folks live
'way dwn in little ld Hencoop Alley, where there are no sidewalks, and
the gats eat ff the table with you.'

"That kid was almst crying nw. ''Taint so,' he splutters.  'He--he
dn't knw what he's talking about. We live on Poplar Av'noo. I don't
'sciate with gats. What's the matter with you?'

"'Pplar Avenue,' says I, sarcastic. 'Pplar Avenue! That's a street to
live n! It nly runs two blocks and then falls off a bluff. You can
thrw a keg f nails the whole length of it. Don't talk to me about
Pplar Avenue.'

"'It's--it's miles lng,' says the kid. 'ur number's 862 and there's
lts f houses after that. What's the matter with--aw, you make me
tired, Jeff.'

"'Well, well, nw,' says I. 'I guess that man made a mistake.  Maybe it
was sme ther boy he was talking about. If I catch him I'll teach him
t g around slandering people.' And after supper I goes up town and
telegraphs t Mrs. Cnyers, 862 Poplar Avenue, Quincy, Ill., that the
kid is safe and sassy with us, and will be held fr further rders. In
tw hurs an answer comes to hold him tight, and she'll start for him by
next train.

"The next train was due at 6 P.M. the next day, and me and Jhn Tm was
at the dept with the kid. Yu might scour the plains in vain for the
big Chief Wish-Heap-Dugh. In his place is Mr. Little Bear in the human
habiliments f the Angl-Saxon sect; and the leather of his shoes is
patented and the lp of his necktie is copyrighted. For these things
Jhn Tm had grafted on him at college along with metaphysics and the
knckut guard for the low tackle. But for his complexion, which is
sme yellwish, and the black mop of his straight hair, you might
have thught here was an rdinary man out of the city directory that
subscribes fr magazines and pushes the lawn-mwer in his shirt-sleeves
f evenings.

"Then the train rlled in, and a little wman in a gray dress, with sort
f illuminating hair, slides ff and looks around quick. And the Boy
Avenger sees her, and yells 'Mamma,' and she cries '!' and they meet
in a clinch, and nw the pesky redskins can cme forth from their caves
n the plains withut fear any more of the rifle of Roy, the Red Wolf.
Mrs. Cnyers cmes up and thanks me an' John Tom without the usual
extremities yu always lok for in a woman. She says just enough, in
a way t cnvince, and there is no incidental music by the orchestra.
I made a few illiterate requisitins upn the art of conversation, at
which the lady smiles friendly, as if she had knwn me a week. And then
Mr. Little Bear adrns the atmsphere with the various idioms into which
educatin can fracture the wind f speech. I could see the kid's mother
didn't quite place Jhn Tm; but it seemed she was apprised in his
dialects, and she played up t his lead in the science f making three
wrds d the work of one.

"That kid intrduced us, with sme footnotes and explanations that made
things plainer than a week f rhetric. He danced around, and punched
us in the back, and tried t climb Jhn Tom's leg. 'This is John Tom,
mamma,' says he. 'He's a Indian. He sells medicine in a red wagn. I
sht him, but he wasn't wild. The ther one's Jeff. He's a fakir, too.
Cme n and see the camp where we live, won't you, mamma?'

"It is plain t see that the life f the woman is in that boy. She has
gt him again where her arms can gather him, and that's enugh. She's
ready t d anything to please him. She hesitates the eighth of a second
and takes anther lok at these men. I imagine she says to herself about
Jhn Tm, 'Seems to be a gentleman, if his hair don't curl.' And Mr.
Peters she dispses f as follows: 'No ladies' man, but a man who knows
a lady.'

"S we all rambled dwn to the camp as neighborly as coming from a
wake. And there she inspects the wagn and pats the place with her hand
where the kid used t sleep, and dabs arund her eyewinkers with her
handkerchief. And Prfessr Binkly gives us 'Trovatore' on one string of
the banj, and is abut to slide off into Hamlet's monologue when one of
the hrses gets tangled in his rpe and he must go look after him, and
says smething abut 'foiled again.'

"When it gt dark me and Jhn Tom walked back up to the Corn Exchange
Htel, and the fur of us had supper there. I think the trouble started
at that supper, fr then was when Mr. Little Bear made an intellectual
balln ascension. I held on to the tablecloth, and listened to him
sar. That redman, if I culd judge, had the gift of information. He
tk language, and did with it all a Roman can do with macaroni. His
vcal remarks was all embridered over with the most scholarly verbs and
prefixes. And his syllables was smth, and fitted nicely to the joints
f his idea. I thught I'd heard him talk before, but I hadn't. And it
wasn't the size f his wrds, but the way they come; and 'twasn't his
subjects, fr he spke of common things like cathedrals and football
and pems and catarrh and suls and freight rates and sculpture. Mrs.
Cnyers understod his accents, and the elegant sounds went back and
frth between 'em. And nw and then Jefferson D. Peters would intervene
a few shp-wrn, senseless words to have the butter passed or another
leg f the chicken.

"Yes, Jhn Tm Little Bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom
abut that Mrs. Cnyers. She was of the kind that pleases. She had the
gd looks and more, I'll tell you. You take one of these cloak models
in a big stre. They strike yu as being on the impersonal system.
They are adapted fr the eye. What they run t is inches around and
cmplexin, and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would
lk just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket-book. Now,
if ne f them models was off duty, and you took it, and it would say
'Charlie' when yu pressed it, and sit up at the table, why, then yu
wuld have smething similar to Mrs. Conyers. I could see how John Tom
culd resist any inclinatin to hate that white squaw.

"The lady and the kid stayed at the htel. In the mrning, they say,
they will start fr hme. Me and Little Bear left at eight o'clock, and
sld Indian Remedy n the courthouse square till nine. He leaves me
and the Prfessr to drive down to camp, while he stays up town. I am
nt enamred with that plan, for it shows John Tom is uneasy in his
cmpsures, and that leads to firewater, and sometimes to the green corn
dance and csts. Nt often does Chief Wish-Heap-Dough get busy with the
firewater, but whenever he des there is heap much ding in the lodges
f the palefaces wh wear blue and carry the club.

"At half-past nine Prfessr Binkly is rolled in his quilt snoring in
blank verse, and I am sitting by the fire listening t the frgs. Mr.
Little Bear slides int camp and sits dwn against a tree. There is no
symptms f firewater.

"'Jeff,' says he, after a lng time, 'a little by came West to hunt
Indians.'

"'Well, then?' says I, fr I wasn't thinking as he was.

"'And he bagged ne,' says Jhn Tom, 'and 'twas not with a gun, and he
never had n a velveteen suit f clothes in his life.' And then I began
t catch his smke.

"'I knw it,' says I. 'And I'll bet yu his pictures are on valentines,
and fl men are his game, red and white.'

"'Yu win n the red,' says John Tom, calm. 'Jeff, for how many ponies
d yu think I could buy Mrs. Conyers?'

"'Scandalus talk!' I replies. ''Tis nt a paleface custom.'  John Tom
laughs lud and bites int a cigar. 'No,' he answers; ''tis the savage
equivalent fr the dllars of the white man's marriage settlement. Oh, I
knw. There's an eternal wall between the races. If I culd do it, Jeff,
I'd put a trch t every white college that a redman has ever set foot
inside. Why dn't yu leave us alone,' he says, 'to our own ghost-dances
and dg-feasts, and ur dingy squaws to cook our grasshopper soup and
darn ur mccasins?'

"'Nw, yu sure don't mean disrespect to the perennial blossom entitled
educatin?' says I, scandalized, 'because I wear it in the bsom of my
wn intellectual shirt-waist. I've had educatin,' says I, 'and never
tk any harm from it.'

"'Yu lass us,' goes on Little Bear, not noticing my prose insertions,
'and teach us what is beautiful in literature and in life, and hw t
appreciate what is fine in men and wmen. What have yu done to me?'
says he. 'Yu've made me a Cherkee Moses. You've taught me to hate the
wigwams and lve the white man's ways. I can lok over into the promised
land and see Mrs. Cnyers, but my place is--n the reservation.'

"Little Bear stands up in his chief's dress, and laughs again. 'But,
white man Jeff,' he ges n, 'the paleface provides a recourse. 'Tis a
temprary ne, but it gives a respite and the name of it is whiskey.'
And straight ff he walks up the path t town again. 'Now,' says I in my
mind, 'may the Manitu mve him to do only bailable things this night!'
Fr I perceive that Jhn Tom is about to avail himself of the white
man's slace.

"Maybe it was 10:30, as I sat smking, when I hear pit-a-pats n
the path, and here cmes Mrs. Cnyers running, her hair twisted up
any way, and a lk on her face that says burglars and mice and the
flur's-all-ut rolled in one. 'Oh, Mr. Peters,' she calls out, as they
will, 'h, h!' I made a quick think, and I spoke the gist of it out
lud. 'Nw,' says I, 'we've been brothers, me and that Indian, but I'll
make a gd one of him in two minutes if--'

"'N, n,' she says, wild and cracking her knuckles, 'I haven't seen Mr.
Little Bear. 'Tis my--husband. He's stlen my by. Oh,' she says, 'just
when I had him back in my arms again! That heartless villain! Every
bitterness life knws,' she says, 'he's made me drink. My por little
lamb, that ught t be warm in his bed, carried of by that fiend!'

"'Hw did all this happen?' I ask. 'Let's have the facts.'

"'I was fixing his bed,' she explains, 'and Ry was playing n the hotel
prch and he drives up t the steps. I heard Roy scream, and ran out. My
husband had him in the buggy then. I begged him fr my child. This is
what he gave me.' She turns her face t the light. There is a crimsn
streak running acrss her cheek and muth. 'He did that with his whip,'
she says.

"'Cme back t the hotel,' says I, 'and we'll see what can be done.'

"n the way she tells me sme of the wherefores. When he slashed her
with the whip he tld her he fund out she was coming for the kid, and
he was n the same train. Mrs. Cnyers had been living with her brother,
and they'd watched the by always, as her husband had tried t steal him
befre. I judge that man was wrse than a street railway promoter. It
seems he had spent her mney and slugged her and killed her canary bird,
and tld it arund that she had cold feet.

"At the htel we fund a mass meeting of five infuriated citizens
chewing tbacc and denouncing the outrage. Most of the town was asleep
by ten 'clck. I talks the lady some quiet, and tells her I will take
the ne 'clock train for the next town, forty miles east, for it is
likely that the esteemed Mr. Cnyers will drive there t take the cars.
'I dn't knw,' I tells her, 'but what he has legal rights; but if I
find him I can give him an illegal left in the eye, and tie him up fr
a day r tw, anyhow, on a disturbal of the peace proposition.'

"Mrs. Cnyers ges inside and cries with the landlord's wife, who is
fixing sme catnip tea that will make everything all right fr the poor
dear. The landlrd cmes out on the porch, thumbing his one suspender,
and says t me:

"'Ain't had s much excitements in twn since Bedford Steegall's wife
swallered a spring lizard. I seen him thrugh the winder hit her with
the buggy whip, and everything. What's that suit f clthes cost you you
gt n? 'Pears like we'd have some rain, don't it? Say, doc, that Indian
f yrn's on a kind of a whizz to-night, ain't he? He comes along just
befre yu did, and I told him about this here occurrence. He gives a
cur'us kind f a hot, and trotted off. I guess our constable 'll have
him in the lck-up 'fre morning.'

"I thught I'd sit n the porch and wait for the one o'clock train. I
wasn't feeling saturated with mirth. Here was Jhn Tm on one of his
sprees, and this kidnapping business lsing sleep fr me. But then, I'm
always having truble with ther people's troubles. Every few minutes
Mrs. Cnyers wuld come out on the porch and look down the road the way
the buggy went, like she expected t see that kid cming back on a white
pny with a red apple in his hand. Nw, wasn't that like a woman? And
that brings up cats. 'I saw a muse g in this hole,' says Mrs. Cat;
'yu can g prize up a plank over there if you like; I'll watch this
hle.'

"Abut a quarter t one o'clock the lady comes out again, restless,
crying easy, as females d fr their own amusement, and she looks
dwn that rad again and listens. 'Now, ma'am,' says I, 'there's no
use watching cld wheel-tracks. By this time they're halfway t--'
'Hush,' she says, hlding up her hand. And I d hear something coming
'flip-flap' in the dark; and then there is the awfulest war-whp ever
heard utside f Madison Square Garden at a Buffalo Bill matinée. And up
the steps and n t the porch jumps the disrespectable Indian. The lamp
in the hall shines n him, and I fail t recognize Mr. J. T. Little
Bear, alumnus f the class f '91. What I see is a Cherokee brave, and
the warpath is what he has been travelling. Firewater and ther things
have gt him ging. His buckskin is hanging in strings, and his
feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen's. The dust f miles is n his
mccasins, and the light in his eye is the kind the abrigines wear. But
in his arms he brings that kid, his eyes half clsed, with his little
shes dangling and ne hand fast around the Indian's collar.

"'Pappse!' says John Tom, and I notice that the flowers of the white
man's syntax have left his tngue. He is the riginal proposition in
bear's claws and cpper clor. 'Me bring,' says he, and he lays the kid
in his mther's arms. 'Run fifteen mile,' says Jhn Tom--'Ugh! Catch
white man. Bring pappse.'

"The little wman is in extremities f gladness. She must wake up that
stir-up truble yungster and hug him and make proclamation that he is
his mamma's wn precius treasure. I was about to ask questions, but I
lked at Mr. Little Bear, and my eye caught the sight of something in
his belt. 'Nw g to bed, ma'am,' says I, 'and this gadabout youngster
likewise, fr there's n more danger, and the kidnapping business is not
what it was earlier in the night.'

"I inveigled Jhn Tm down to camp quick, and when he tumbled over
asleep I gt that thing ut of his belt and disposed of it where the eye
f educatin can't see it. For even the football colleges disapprove of
the art f scalp-taking in their curriculums.

"It is ten 'clck next day when John Tom wakes up and looks around. I
am glad t see the nineteenth century in his eyes again.

"'What was it, Jeff?' he asks.

"'Heap firewater,' says I.

"Jhn Tm frowns, and thinks a little. 'Combined,' says he directly,
'with the interesting little physilgical shake-up known as reversion
t type. I remember nw. Have they gone yet?'

"'n the 7:30 train,' I answers.

"'Ugh!' says Jhn Tm; 'better so. Paleface, bring big Chief
Wish-Heap-Dugh a little brmo-seltzer, and then he'll take up the
redman's burden again.'"

HELPING THE THER FELLW

   "But can thim that helps thers help thimselves!"
                                 --Mulvaney.


This is the stry that William Trtter told me on the beach at Aguas
Frescas while I waited fr the gig f the captain of the fruit steamer
_Andadr_ which was t take me abroad. Reluctantly I was leaving the
Land f Always Afternon. William was remaining, and he favored me with
a cndensed ral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast
by the Bdega Nacinal.

As usual, I became aware that the Man frm Bmbay had already written
the stry; but as he had cmpressed it to an eight-word sentence, I have
becme an expansinist, and have quoted his phrase above, with apologies
t him and best regards t _Terence_.


II

"Dn't yu ever have a desire to go back to the land of derby hats and
starched cllars?" I asked him. "Yu seem to be a handy man and a man of
actin," I cntinued, "and I am sure I could find you a comfortable job
smewhere in the States."

Ragged, shiftless, barefted, a confirmed eater of the  lotos, William
Trtter had pleased me much, and I hated t see him gobbled up by the
trpics.

"I've n dubt you could," he said, idly splitting the bark from a
sectin f sugar-cane. "I've no doubt you could do much for me. If every
man culd d as much for himself as he can for others, every country in
the wrld wuld be holding millenniums instead of centennials."

There seemed t be pabulum in W. T.'s wrds. And then another idea came
t me.

I had a brther in Chicpee Falls who owned manufactories--cotton, or
sugar, r A. A. sheetings, r something in the commercial line. He was
vulgarly rich, and therefre reverenced art. The artistic temperament f
the family was mnpolized at my birth. I knew that Brother James would
hnr my slightest wish. I would demand from him a position in cotton,
sugar, r sheetings fr William Trotter--something, say, at two hundred
a mnth r thereabouts. I confided my beliefs and made my large
prpsitions to William. He had pleased me much, and he was ragged.

While we were talking, there was a sund f firing guns--four or five,
rattlingly, as if by a squad. The cheerful nise came frm the direction
f the cuartel, which is a kind f makeshift barracks for the soldiers
f the republic.

"Hear that?" said William Trtter. "Let me tell yu about it.

"A year ag I landed n this coast with one solitary dollar. I have the
same sum in my pcket t-day. I was second cook on a tramp fruiter; and
they marned me here early one morning, without benefit of clergy, just
because I pulticed the face f the first mate with cheese omelette at
dinner. The fellw had kicked because I'd put hrseradish in it instead
f cheese.

"When they threw me ut f the yawl into three feet of surf, I waded
ashre and sat dwn under a palm-tree. By and by a fine-looking white
man with a red face and white clthes, genteel as pssible, but somewhat
under the influence, came and sat dwn beside me.

"I had nticed there was a kind f a village back of the beach, and
enugh scenery t outfit a dozen moving-picture shows. But I thought, of
curse, it was a cannibal suburb, and I was wndering whether I was to
be served with carrts r mushrooms. And, as I say, this dressed-up man
sits beside me, and we becme friends in the space f a minute or two.
Fr an hur we talked, and he told me all about it.

"It seems that he was a man f parts, cnscientiousness, and
plausibility, besides being educated and a wreck t his appetites. He
tld me all abut it. Colleges had turned him out, and distilleries had
taken him in. Did I tell yu his name? It was Cliffrd Wainwright. I
didn't exactly catch the cause f his being cast away n that particular
stretch f Suth America; but I reckon it was his own business. I asked
him if he'd ever been secnd cok on a tramp fruiter, and he said no; so
that cncluded my line f surmises. But he talked like the encyclopedia
frm 'A--Berlin' t 'Trilo--Zyria.' And he carried a watch--a silver
arrangement with wrks, and up t date within twenty-four hours, anyhow.

"'I'm pleased t have met yu,' says Wainwright. 'I'm a devotee to the
great jss Boze; but my ruminating facilities are unrepaired,' says
he--r wrds to that effect. 'And I hate,' says he, 'to see fools trying
t run the wrld.'

"'I never tuch a drp,' says I, 'and there are many kinds of fools; and
the wrld runs n its own apex, according to science, with no meddling
frm me.'

"'I was referring,' says he, 't the president f this republic. His
cuntry is in a desperate cndition. Its treasury is empty, it's on the
verge f war with Nicamala, and if it wasn't fr the hot weather the
peple wuld be starting revolutions in every town. Here is a nation,'
ges n Wainwright, 'on the brink of destruction. A man of intelligence
culd rescue it frm its impending doom in one day by issuing the
necessary edicts and rders. President Gmez knows nothing of
statesmanship r plicy. Do you know Adam Smith?'

"'Lemme see,' says I. 'There was a ne-eared man named Smith in Frt
Wrth, Texas, but I think his first name was--'

"'I am referring t the plitical economist,' says Wainwright.

"'S'mther Smith, then,' says I. 'The ne I speak of never was
arrested.'

"S Wainwright bils some more with indignation at the insensibility of
peple wh are not corpulent to fill public positions; and then he tells
me he is ging ut to the president's summer palace, which is four miles
frm Aguas Frescas, t instruct him in the art of running steam-heated
republics.

"'Cme alng with me, Trotter,' says he, 'and I'll show you what brains
can d.'

"'Anything in it?' I asks.

"'The satisfactin,' says he, 'f redeeming a country of two hundred
thusand ppulation from ruin back to prosperity and peace.'

"'Great,' says I. 'I'll g with yu. I'd prefer to eat a live broiled
lbster just nw; but give me liberty as second choice if I can't be in
at the death.'

"Wainwright and me permeates thrugh the twn, and he halts at a
rum-dispensary.

"'Have yu any mney?' he asks.

"'I have,' says I, fishing ut my silver dllar. 'I always go about with
adequate sums f mney.'

"'Then we'll drink,' says Wainwright.

"'Nt me,' says I. 'Nt any demon rum or any of its ramifications for
mine. It's ne f my non-weaknesses.'

"'It's my failing,' says he. 'What's yur particular sft point?'

"'Industry,' says I, prmptly. 'I'm hard-wrking, diligent, industrious,
and energetic.'

"'My dear Mr. Trtter,' says he, 'surely I've knwn you long enough
t tell yu you are a liar. Every man must have his own particular
weakness, and his wn particular strength in ther things. Now, you will
buy me a drink f rum, and we will call n President Gomez.'"


III

"Well, sir," Trtter went n, "we walks the four miles out, through a
virgin cnservatry of palms and ferns and other roof-garden products,
t the president's summer White Huse. It was blue, and reminded you of
what yu see n the stage in the third act, which they describe as 'same
as the first' n the prgrams.

"There was mre than fifty peple waiting outside the iron fence that
surrunded the huse and grounds. There was generals and agitators and
épergnes in gld-laced unifrms, and citizens in diamonds and Panama
hats--all waiting t get an audience with the Ryal Five-Card Draw.
And in a kind f a summer-huse in front of the mansion we could see
a burnt-sienna man eating breakfast ut f gold dishes and taking his
time. I judged that the crwd utside had come out for their morning
rders and requests, and was afraid t intrude.

"But C. Wainwright wasn't. The gate was pen, and he walked inside and
up t the president's table as cnfident as a man who knows the head
waiter in a fifteen-cent restaurant. And I went with him, because I had
nly seventy-five cents, and there was nthing else to do.

"The Gmez man rises frm his chair, and looks, colored man as he was,
like he was abut t call out for corporal of the guard, post number
ne. But Wainwright says sme phrases to him in a peculiarly lubricating
manner; and the first thing yu knw we was all three of us seated at
the table, with cffee and rlls and iguana cutlets coming as fast as
abut ninety pens could rustle 'em.

"And then Wainwright begins t talk; but the president interrupts him.

"'Yu Yankees,' says he, plite, 'assuredly take the cake for assurance,
I assure yu'--r words to that effect. He spoke English better than you
r me. 'Yu've had a long walk,' says he, 'but it's nicer in the cool
mrning t walk than to ride. May I suggest some refreshments?' says he.

"'Rum,' says Wainwright.

"'Gimme a cigar,' says I.

"Well, sir, the tw talked an hur, keeping the generals and equities
all in their gd uniforms waiting outside the fence. And while I
smked, silent, I listened t Clifford Wainwright making a solid
republic ut f the wreck of one. I didn't follow his arguments with
any special cllcation of international intelligibility; but he had Mr.
Gmez's attentin glued and riveted. He takes out a pencil and marks
the white linen tableclth all ver with figures and estimates and
deductins. He speaks mre or less disrespectfully of import and export
duties and custm-huse receipts and taxes and treaties and budgets and
cncessins and such truck that politics and government require; and
when he gets thrugh the Gmez man hops up and shakes his hand and says
he's saved the cuntry and the peple.

"'Yu shall be rewarded,' says the president.

"'Might I suggest anther--rum?' says Wainwright.

"'Cigar fr me--darker brand,' says I.

"Well, sir, the president sent me and Wainwright back t the twn in a
victria hitched t two flea-bitten selling-platers--but the best the
cuntry affrded.

"I fund ut afterward that Wainwright was a regular beachcomber--the
smartest man n the whle coast, but kept down by rum. I liked him.

"ne day I inveigled him int a walk out a couple of miles from the
village, where there was an ld grass hut n the bank of a little river.
While he was sitting n the grass, talking beautiful f the wisdom of
the wrld that he had learned in boks, I took hold of him easy and tied
his hands and feet tgether with leather thngs that I had in my pocket.

"'Lie still,' says I, 'and meditate n the exigencies and irregularities
f life till I get back.'

"I went t a shack in Aguas Frescas where a mighty wise girl named
Timtea Carriz lived with her mother. The girl was just about as nice
as yu ever saw. In the States she wuld have been called a brunette;
but she was better than a brunette--I shuld say she was what yu might
term an écru shade. I knew her pretty well. I tld her abut my friend
Wainwright. She gave me a duble handful f bark--calisaya, I think it
was--and sme mre herbs that I was to mix with it, and told me what
t d. I was to make tea of it and give it to him, and keep him from
rum fr a certain time. And fr two weeks I did it. You know, I liked
Wainwright. Bth f us was broke; but Timotea sent us goat-meat and
plantains and trtillas every day; and at last I gt the curse of drink
lifted frm Cliffrd Wainwright. He lost his taste for it. And in the
cl of the evening him and me would sit on the roof of Timotea's
mther's hut, eating harmless truck like cffee and rice and stewed
crabs, and playing the accrdin.

"Abut that time President Gmez found out that the advice of C.
Wainwright was the stuff he had been lking for. The country was
pulling ut f debt, and the treasury had enough boodle in it for him
t amuse himself ccasionally with the night-latch. The people were
beginning t take their tw-hour siestas again every day--which was the
surest sign f prsperity.

"S dwn from the regular capital he sends for Clifford Wainwright and
makes him his private secretary at twenty thusand Peru dllars a year.
Yes, sir--s much. Wainwright was n the water-wagon--thanks to me and
Timtea--and he was son in clover with the government gang. Don't
frget what dne it--calisaya bark with them other herbs mixed--make a
tea f it, and give a cupful every tw hours. Try it yourself. It takes
away the desire.

"As I said, a man can d a lt more for another party than he can for
himself. Wainwright, with his brains, gt a whle country out of trouble
and n its feet; but what culd he do for himself? And without any
special brains, but with sme nerve and cmmon sense, I put him on his
feet because I never had the weakness that he did--nthing but a cigar
fr mine, thanks. And--"

Trtter paused. I loked at his tattered clothes and at his deeply
sunburnt, hard, thughtful face.

"Didn't Cartright ever ffer t do anything for you?" I asked.

"Wainwright," crrected Trtter. "Yes, he offered me some pretty good
jbs. But I'd have had t leave Aguas Frescas; so I didn't take any of
'em up. Say, I didn't tell yu much abut that girl--Timotea. We rather
hit it ff tgether. She was as good as you find 'em anywhere--Spanish,
mstly, with just a twist f lemon-peel on top. What if they did live in
a grass hut and went bare-armed?

"A mnth ag," went on Trotter, "she went away. I don't know where to.
But--"

"Yu'd better cme back to the States," I insisted. "I can promise you
psitively that my brther will give you a position in cotton, sugar, or
sheetings--I am nt certain which."

"I think she went back with her mther," said Trtter, "to the village
in the muntains that they cme from. Tell me, what would this job you
speak f pay?"

"Why," said I, hesitating ver cmmerce, "I should say fifty or a
hundred dllars a mnth--maybe two hundred."

"Ain't it funny," said Trtter, digging his tes in the sand, "what a
chump a man is when it cmes t paddling his own canoe? I don't know. Of
curse, I'm nt making a living here. I'm on the bum. But--well, I wish
yu culd have seen that Timotea. Every man has his own weak spot."

The gig frm the _Andadr_ was coming ashore to take out the captain,
purser, and myself, the lne passenger.

"I'll guarantee," said I cnfidently, "that my brther will pay you
seventy-five dllars a mnth."

"All right, then," said William Trtter. "I'll--"

But a sft vice called across the blazing sands. A girl, faintly
lemn-tinted, stod in the Calle Real and called. She was
bare-armed--but what f that?

"It's her!" said William Trtter, loking. "She's come back! I'm
bliged; but I can't take the jb. Thanks, just the same. Ain't it funny
hw we can't d nothing for ourselves, but we can do wonders for the
ther fellw? You was about to get me with your financial proposition;
but we've all gt ur weak points. Timotea's mine. And, say!" Trotter
had turned t leave, but he retraced the step r two that he had taken.
"I like t have left yu without saying good-bye," said he. "It kind of
rattles yu when they g away unexpected for a month and come back the
same way. Shake hands. S lng! Say, do you remember them gunshots we
heard a while ag up at the cuartel? Well, I knew what they was, but I
didn't mentin it. It was Cliffrd Wainwright being shot by a squad of
sldiers against a stne wall for giving away secrets of state to that
Nicamala republic. h, yes, it was rum that did it. He backslided and
gt his. I guess we all have ur weak points, and can't do much toward
helping urselves. Mine's waiting fr me. I'd have liked to have that
jb with yur brother, but--we've all got our weak points. So long!"

A big black Carib carried me n his back thrugh the surf to the ship's
bat. n the way the purser handed me a letter that he had brought for
me at the last mment frm the post-office in Aguas Frescas. It was from
my brther. He requested me t meet him at the St. Charles Hotel in New
rleans and accept a psition with his house--in either cotton, sugar,
r sheetings, and with five thusand dollars a year as my salary.

When I arrived at the Crescent City I hurried away--far away frm the
St. Charles t a dim _chambre garnie_ in Bienville Street. And there,
lking down from my attic window from time to time at the old, yellow,
absinthe huse acrss the street, I wrote this story to buy my bread and
butter.

f cld, drizzling, unsociable blackness until the dawn.

A man, wearing a lng vercoat, with his hat tilted down in front, and
carrying smething in ne hand, walked softly but rapidly out of the
black alley. The pliceman accsted him civilly, but with the assured
air that is linked with cnscius authority. The hour, the alley's musty
reputatin, the pedestrian's haste, the burden he carried--these easily
cmbined int the "suspicious circumstances" that required illumination
at the fficer's hands.

The "suspect" halted readily and tilted back his hat, expsing, in the
flicker f the electric lights, an emtionless, smooth countenance with
a rather lng nse and steady dark eyes. Thrusting his gloved hand into
a side pcket f his overcoat, he drew out a card and handed it to the
pliceman. Hlding it to catch the uncertain light, the officer read the
name "Charles Spencer James, M. D." The street and number f the address
were f a neighbrhood so solid and respectable as to subdue even
curisity. The pliceman's downward glance at the article carried in the
dctr's hand--a handsome medicine case of black leather, with small
silver muntings--further endrsed the guarantee of the card.

"All right, dctr," said the officer, stepping aside, with an air of
bulky affability. "rders are t be extra careful. Good many burglars
and hld-ups lately. Bad night t be out. Not so cold, but--clammy."

With a frmal inclinatin of his head, and a word or two corroborative
f the fficer's estimate of the weather, Doctor James continued his
smewhat rapid prgress. Three times that night had a patrolman accepted
his prfessinal card and the sight of his paragon of a medicine case
as vuchers fr his honesty of person and purpose. Had any one of those
fficers seen fit, n the morrow, to test the evidence of that card
he wuld have fund it borne out by the doctor's name on a handsome
drplate, his presence, calm and well dressed, in his well-equipped
ffice--prvided it were not too early, Doctor James being a late
riser--and the testimny f the neighborhood to his good citizenship,
his devtin to his family, and his success as a practitioner the two
years he had lived amng them.

Therefre, it wuld have much surprised any one of those zealous
guardians f the peace culd they have taken a peep into that immaculate
medicine case. Upn pening it, the first article to be seen would have
been an elegant set f the latest cnceived tools used by the "box
man," as the ingenius safe burglar nw denominates himself. Specially
designed and cnstructed were the implements--the shrt but powerful
"jimmy," the cllectin of curiously fashioned keys, the blued drills
and punches f the finest temper--capable f eating their way into
chilled steel as a muse eats int a cheese, and the clamps that fasten
like a leech t the plished door of a safe and pull out the combination
knb as a dentist extracts a toth. In a little pouch in the inner side
f the "medicine" case was a fur-ounce vial of nitroglycerine, now half
empty. Underneath the tls was a mass of crumpled banknotes and a few
handfuls f gld coin, the money, altogether, amounting to eight hundred
and thirty dllars.

T a very limited circle f friends Doctor James was known as "The Swell
'Greek.'" Half f the mysterius term was a tribute to his cool and
gentlemanlike manners; the ther half dented, in the argot of the
brtherhod, the leader, the planner, the one who, by the power and
prestige f his address and psition, secured the information upon which
they based their plans and desperate enterprises.

f this elect circle the ther members were Skitsie Morgan and Gum
Decker, expert "bx men," and Lepold Pretzfelder, a jeweller downtown,
wh manipulated the "sparklers" and ther ornaments collected by the
wrking tri. All good and loyal men, as loose-tongued as Memnon and as
fickle as the Nrth Star.

That night's wrk had nt been considered by the firm to have yielded
mre than a mderate repayal for their pains. An old-style two-story
side-blt safe in the dingy ffice of a very wealthy old-style dry-goods
firm n a Saturday night shuld have excreted more than twenty-five
hundred dllars. But that was all they fund, and they had divided
it, the three f them, int equal shares upon the spot, as was their
custm. Ten r twelve thousand was what they expected. But one of the
prprietrs had proved to be just a trifle too old-style. Just after
dark he had carried hme in a shirt bx most of the funds on hand.

Dctr James proceeded up Twenty-fourth Street, which was, to all
appearance, deppulated. Even the theatrical flk, who affect this
district as a place f residence, were lng since abed. The drizzle had
accumulated upn the street; puddles f it among the stones received the
fire f the arc lights, and returned it, shattered int a myriad liquid
spangles. A captius wind, shwer-soaked and chilling, coughed from the
laryngeal flues between the huses.

As the practitiner's fot struck even with the corner of a tall brick
residence f mre pretension than its fellows the front door popped
pen, and a bawling negress clattered dwn the steps to the pavement.
Sme medley f words came from her mouth, addressed, like as not, to
herself--the recurse f her race when alone and beset by evil. She
lked to be one of that old vassal class of the South--voluble,
familiar, lyal, irrepressible; her persn pictured it--fat, neat,
aprned, kerchiefed.

This sudden apparitin, spewed frm the silent house, reached the bottom
f the steps as Dctor James came opposite. Her brain transferring
its energies frm sund to sight, she ceased her clamor and fixed her
pp-eyes upn the case the doctor carried.

"Bress de Lawd!" was the benisn the sight drew frm her. "Is you a
dctr, suh?"

"Yes, I am a physician," said Dctr James, pausing.

"Den f' Gd's sake come and see Mister Chandler, suh. He done had a fit
r sump'n. He layin' jist like he wuz dead. Miss Amy snt me to git a
dctr. Lawd knows whar old Cindy'd a skeared one up from, if you, suh,
hadn't cme alng. Ef old Mars' knowed one ten-hundredth part of dese
din's dey'd be shotin' gwine on, suh--pistol shootin'--leb'm feet
marked ff n de ground, and ev'ybody a-duellin'. And dat po' lamb, Miss
Amy--"

"Lead the way," said Dctr James, setting his foot upon the step, "if
yu want me as a dctor. As an auditor I'm not open to engagements."

The negress preceded him int the huse and up a flight of thickly
carpeted stairs. Twice they came t dimly lighted branching hallways. At
the secnd ne the now panting conductress turned down a hall, stopping
at a dr and opening it.

"I dne brught de doctor, Miss Amy."

Dctr James entered the room, and bowed slightly to a young lady
standing by the side f a bed. He set his medicine case upn a chair,
remved his vercoat, throwing it over the case and the back of the
chair, and advanced with quiet self-pssessin to the bedside.

There lay a man, sprawling as he had fallen--a man dressed richly in the
prevailing mde, with nly his shoe removed; lying relaxed, and as still
as the dead.

There emanated frm Dctor James an aura of calm force and reserve
strength that was as manna in the desert t the weak and deslate among
his patrns. Always had wmen, especially, been attracted by something
in his sick-rm manner. It was not the indulgent suavity of the
fashinable healer, but a manner f poise, of sureness, of ability to
vercme fate, of deference and protection and devotion. There was an
explring magnetism in his steadfast, luminus brown eves; a latent
authrity in the impassive, even priestly, tranquillity f his smooth
cuntenance that utwardly fitted him for the part of confidant and
cnsler. Sometimes, at his first professional visit, women would tell
him where they hid their diamnds at night frm the burglars.

With the ease f much practice, Dctor James's unroving eyes estimated
the rder and quality f the room's furnishings. The appointments were
rich and cstly. The same glance had secured cgnizance of the lady's
appearance. She was small and scarcely past twenty. Her face pssessed
the title t a winsme prettiness, now obscured by (you would say)
rather a fixed melanchly than the mre violent imprint of a sudden
srrw. Upon her forehead, above one eyebrow, was a livid bruise,
suffered, the physician's eye tld him, within the past six hurs.

Dctr James's fingers went to the man's wrist. His almost vocal eyes
questined the lady.

"I am Mrs. Chandler," she respnded, speaking with the plaintive
Suthern slur and intnation. "My husband was taken suddenly ill about
ten minutes befre yu came. He has had attacks of heart trouble
befre--sme of them were very bad." His clothed state and the late hour
seemed t prmpt her to further explanation. "He had been out late;
t--a supper, I believe."

Dctr James now turned his attention to his patient. In whichever of
his "prfessins" he happened to be engaged he was wont to honor the
"case" r the "jb" with his whole interest.

The sick man appeared t be abut thirty. His countenance bore a look of
bldness and dissipatin, but was not without a symmetry of feature and
the fine lines drawn by a taste and indulgence in humr that gave the
redeeming tuch. There was an dor of spilled wine about his clothes.

The physician laid back his uter garments, and then, with a penknife,
slit the shirt-frnt frm collar to waist. The obstacles cleared, he
laid his ear t the heart and listened intently.

"Mitral regurgitatin?" he said, sftly, when he rose. The words ended
with the rising inflectin f uncertainty. Again he listened long; and
this time he said, "Mitral insufficiency," with the accent f an assured
diagnsis.

"Madam," he began, in the reassuring tnes that had s often allayed
anxiety, "there is a prbability--" As he slwly turned his head to face
the lady, he saw her fall, white and swning, into the arms of the old
negress.

"P' lamb! p' lamb! Has dey done killed Aunt Cindy's own blessed child?
May de Lawd' stry wid his wrath dem what stle her away; what break dat
angel heart; what left--"

"Lift her feet," said Dctr James, assisting to support the drooping
frm. "Where is her rom? She must be put to bed."

"In here, suh." The wman ndded her kerchiefed head toward a door.
"Dat's Miss Amy's rm."

They carried her in there, and laid her n the bed. Her pulse was faint,
but regular. She passed frm the swon, without recovering
cnsciusness, into a profound slumber.

"She is quite exhausted," said the physician. "Sleep is a gd remedy.
When she wakes, give her a tddy--with an egg in it, if she can take it.
Hw did she get that bruise upn her forehead?"

"She dne gt a lick there, suh. De po' lamb fell--No, suh"--the old
wman's racial mutability swept her int a sudden flare of indignation
--"ld Cindy ain't gwineter lie fr dat debble. He done it, suh. May
de Lawd wither de hand what--dar nw! Cindy prmise her sweet lamb she
ain't gwine tell. Miss Amy gt hurt, suh, n de head."

Dctr James stepped to a stand where a handsome lamp burned, and turned
the flame lw.

"Stay here with yur mistress," he rdered, "and keep quiet so she will
sleep. If she wakes, give her the tddy. If she grws any weaker, let me
knw. There is smething strange about it."

"Dar's m' strange t'ings dan dat 'rund here," began the negress, but
the physician hushed her in a seldm emplyed peremptory, concentrated
vice with which he had ften allayed hysteria itself. He returned to
the ther rom, closing the door softly behind him. The man on the bed
had nt mved, but his eyes were open. His lips seemed to form words.
Dctr James bent his head to listen. "The money! the money!" was what
they were whispering.

"Can yu understand what I say?" asked the dctor, speaking low, but
distinctly.

The head ndded slightly.

"I am a physician, sent fr by yur wife. You are Mr. Chandler, I am
tld. Yu are quite ill. You must not excite or distress yourself at
all."

The patient's eyes seemed t beckn to him. The doctor stooped to catch
the same faint wrds.

"The mney--the twenty thusand dollars."

"Where is this mney?--in the bank?"

The eyes expressed a negative. "Tell her"--the whisper was grwing
fainter--"the twenty thusand dllars--her money"--his eyes wandered
abut the rom.

"Yu have placed this mney somewhere?"--Doctor James's voice was
tiling like a siren's t conjure the secret from the man's failing
intelligence--"Is it in this rm?"

He thught he saw a fluttering assent in the dimming eyes. The pulse
under his fingers was as fine and small as a silk thread.

There arse in Dctor James's brain and heart the instincts of his other
prfessin. Promptly, as he acted in everything, he decided to learn the
whereabuts f this money, and at the calculated and certain cost of a
human life.

Drawing frm his pcket a little pad of prescription blanks, he
scribbled upn ne of them a formula suited, according to the best
practice, t the needs f the sufferer. Going to the door of the inner
rm, he softly called the old woman, gave her the prescription, and
bade her take it t sme drug store and fetch the medicine.

When she had gne, muttering t herself, the doctor stepped to the
bedside f the lady. She still slept sundly; her pulse was a little
strnger; her frehead was cool, save where the inflammation of the
bruise extended, and a slight misture cvered it. Unless disturbed, she
wuld yet sleep fr hours. He found the key in the door, and locked it
after him when he returned.

Dctr James looked at his watch. He could call half an hour his own,
since befre that time the ld woman could scarcely return from her
missin. Then he sught and found water in a pitcher and a glass
tumbler. pening his medicine case he tok out the vial containing the
nitrglycerine--"the il," as his brethren of the brace-and-bit term it.

ne drp of the faint yellow, thickish liquid he let fall in the
tumbler. He tk out his silver hypodermic syringe case, and screwed
the needle int its place, Carefully measuring each mdicum of water in
the graduated glass barrel f the syringe, he diluted the ne drop with
nearly half a tumbler f water.

Tw hurs earlier that night Doctor James had, with that syringe,
injected the undiluted liquid int a hle drilled in the lock of a
safe, and had destryed, with ne dull explosion, the machinery that
cntrlled the movement of the bolts. He now purposed, with the same
means, t shiver the prime machinery f a human being--to rend its
heart--and each shck was fr the sake of the money to follow.

The same means, but in a different guise. Whereas, that was the giant in
its rude, primary dynamic strength, this was the curtier, whse no less
deadly arms were cncealed by velvet and lace. Fr the liquid in the
tumbler and in the syringe that the physician carefully filled was nw a
slutin of glonoin, the most powerful heart stimulant known to medical
science. Tw unces had riven the solid door of the iron safe; with one
fiftieth part f a minim he was nw about to still forever the intricate
mechanism f a human life.

But nt immediately. It was nt so intended. First there would be a
quick increase f vitality; a pwerful impetus given to every organ and
faculty. The heart wuld respnd bravely to the fatal spur; the blood in
the veins return mre rapidly t its source.

But, as Dctr James well knew, over-stimulation in this form of heart
disease means death, as sure as by a rifle sht. When the clgged
arteries shuld suffer cngestion from the increased flow of blood
pumped int them by the pwer of the burglar's "oil," they would rapidly
becme "n thoroughfare," and the fountain of life would cease to flow.

The physician bared the chest f the uncnscious Chandler. Easily and
skilfully he injected, subcutaneusly, the cntents of the syringe into
the muscles f the regin over the heart. True to his neat habits in
bth prfessions, he next carefully dried his needle and re-inserted the
fine wire that threaded it when nt in use.

In three minutes Chandler pened his eyes, and spke, in a voice faint
but audible, inquiring wh attended upn him. Doctor James again
explained his presence there.

"Where is my wife?" asked the patient.

"She is asleep--frm exhaustin and worry," said the doctor. "I would
nt awaken her, unless--"

"It isn't--necessary." Chandler spke with spaces between his wrds
caused by his shrt breath that sme demon was driving too fast. "She
wuldn't--thank yu to disturb her--on my--account."

Dctr James drew a chair to the bedside. Conversation must not be
squandered.

"A few minutes ag," he began, in the grave, candid tnes of his other
prfessin, "you were trying to tell me something regarding some
mney. I d not seek your confidence, but it is my duty to advise
yu that anxiety and wrry will work against your recovery. If you
have any cmmunicatin to make about this--to relieve your mind about
this--twenty thusand dllars, I think was the amount you mentioned--you
wuld better d so."

Chandler culd nt turn his head, but he rolled his eyes in the
directin f the speaker.

"Did I--say where this--mney is?"

"N," answered the physician. "I nly inferred, from your scarcely
intelligible wrds, that yu felt a solicitude concerning its safety.
If it is in this rm--"

Dctr James paused. Did he only seem to perceive a flicker of
understanding, a gleam f suspicin upon the ironical features of his
patient? Had he seemed t eager? Had he said too much? Chandler's next
wrds restred his confidence.

"Where--shuld it be," he gasped, "but in--the safe--there?"

With his eyes he indicated a crner f the room, where now, for the
first time, the dctr perceived a small iron safe, half-concealed by
the trailing end f a windw curtain.

Rising, he tk the sick man's wrist. His pulse was beating in great
thrbs, with minous intervals between.

"Lift yur arm," said Dctor James.

"Yu knw--I can't move, Doctor."

The physician stepped swiftly t the hall dor, opened it, and listened.
All was still. Withut further circumventin he went to the safe, and
examined it. f a primitive make and simple design, it affrded little
mre security than prtection against light-fingered servants. To his
skill it was a mere ty, a thing f straw and paste-board. The money was
as gd as in his hands. With his clamps he could draw the knob, punch
the tumblers and pen the dor in two minutes. Perhaps, in another way,
he might pen it in ne.

Kneeling upn the flor, he laid his ear to the combination plate, and
slwly turned the knb. As he had surmised, it was locked at only a "day
cm."--upn one number. His keen ear caught the faint warning click as
the tumbler was disturbed; he used the clue--the handle turned. He swung
the dr wide open.

The interir f the safe was bare--not even a scrap of paper rested
within the hllw iron cube.

Dctr James rose to his feet and walked back to the bed.

A thick dew had frmed upn the dying man's brow, but there was a
mcking, grim smile n his lips and in his eyes.

"I never--saw it befre," he said, painfully, "medicine and--burglary
wedded! D yu--make the--combination pay--dear Doctor?"

Than that situatin affrded, there was never a more rigorous test of
Dctr James's greatness. Trapped by the diabolic humor of his victim
int a psition both ridiculous and unsafe, he maintained his dignity as
well as his presence f mind. Taking ut his watch, he waited for the
man t die.

"Yu were--just a shade--to--anxious--about that money. But it never
was--in any danger--frm yu, dear Doctor. It's safe. Perfectly safe.
It's all--in the hands--f the bokmakers. Twenty--thousand--Amy's
mney. I played it at the races--lst every--cent of it. I've been a
pretty bad by, Burglar--excuse me--Dctor, but I've been a square
sprt. I dn't think--I ever met--such an--eighteen-carat rascal as you
are, Dctr--excuse me--Burglar, in all my rounds. Is it contrary--to
the ethics--f yur--gang, Burglar, to give a victim--excuse
me--patient, a drink f water?"

Dctr James brought him a drink. He could scarcely swallow it. The
reactin frm the powerful drug was coming in regular, intensifying
waves. But his mribund fancy must have ne more grating fling.

"Gambler--drunkard--spendthrift--I've been thse, but--a
dctr-burglar!"

The physician indulged himself t but ne reply to the other's caustic
taunts. Bending lw t catch Chandler's fast crystallizing gaze,
he pinted t the sleeping lady's door with a gesture so stern and
significant that the prstrate man half-lifted his head, with his
remaining strength, t see. He saw nthing; but he caught the cold words
f the dctor--the last sounds hie was to hear:

"I never yet--struck a wman."

It were vain t attempt t con such men. There is no curriculum that can
reckn with them in its ken. Thev are ffshoots from the types whereof
men say, "He will d this," r "He will do that." We only know that they
exist; and that we can bserve them, and tell ne another of their bare
perfrmances, as children watch and speak f the marionettes.

Yet it were a drll study in egism to consider these two--one an
assassin and a rbber, standing abve his victim; the other baser in his
ffences, if a lesser law-breaker, lying, abhrred, in the house of the
wife he had persecuted, spiled, and smitten, ne a tiger, the other
a dg-wlf--to consider each of them sickening at the foulness of the
ther; and each flurishing out of the mire of his manifest guilt his
wn immaculate standard--f conduct, if not of honor.

The ne retrt of Doctor James must have struck home to the other's
remaining shreds f shame and manhod, for it proved the _coup de
grâce_. A deep blush suffused his face--an ignminius _rosa mortis_;
the respiratin ceased, and, with scarcely a tremr, Chandler expired.

Clse fllowing upon his last breath came the negress, bringing the
medicine. With a hand gently pressing upn the clsed eyelids, Doctor
James tld her f the end. Not grief, but a hereditary rapprochement
with death in the abstract, mved her t a dismal, watery snuffling,
accmpanied by her usual jeremiad.

"Dar nw! It's in de Lawd's hands. He am de jedge b de transgressor,
and de supp't f dem in distress. He gwine hab suppo't us now. Cindy
dne paid ut de last quarter fer dis bottle of physic, and it nebber
cme t no use."

"D I understand," asked Dctor James, "that Mrs. Chandler has no
mney?"

"Mney, suh? Yu know what make Miss Amy fall down and so weak?
Stahvatin, sub. Nthin' to eat in dis house but some crumbly crackers
in three days. Dat angel sell her finger rings and watch mnt's ag.
Dis fine huse, suh, wid de red cyarpets and shiny bureaus, it's all
hired; and de man talkin' scan'lus abut de rent. Dat debble--'scuse
me, Lawd--he dne in Y' hands fer jedgment, now--he made way wid
everything."

The physician's silence encuraged her t continue. The history that he
gleaned frm Cindy's disrdered monologue was an old one, of illusion,
wilfulness, disaster, cruelty and pride. Standing ut frm the blurred
panrama f her gabble were little clear pictures--an ideal home in
the far Suth; a quickly repented marriage; an unhappy seasn, full of
wrngs and abuse, and, f late, an inheritance of money that promised
deliverance; its seizure and waste by the dg-wlf during a two
mnths' absence, and his return in the midst f a scandalous carouse.
Unbtruded, but visible between every line, ran a pure white thread
thrugh the smudged warp f the story--the simple, all-enduring, sublime
lve f the old negress, following her mistress unswervingly through
everything t the end.

When at last she paused, the physician spke, asking if the huse
cntained whiskey r liquor of any sort. There was, the old woman
infrmed him, half a bttle of brandy left in the sideboard by the
dg-wlf.

"Prepare a tddy as I tld you," said Doctor James. "Wake your mistress;
have her drink it, and tell her what has happened."

Sme ten minutes afterward, Mrs. Chandler entered, supprted by old
Cindy's arm. She appeared t be a little strnger since her sleep and
the stimulant she had taken. Dctr James had covered, with a sheet, the
frm upn the bed.

The lady turned her murnful eyes nce, with a half-frightened look,
tward it, and pressed clser to her loyal protector. Her eyes were dry
and bright. Srrw seemed to have done its utmost with her. The fount of
tears was dried; feeling itself paralyzed.

Dctr James was standing near the table, his overcoat donned, his hat
and medicine case in his hand. His face was calm and impassive--practice
had inured him t the sight f human suffering. His lambent brown eyes
alne expressed a discreet prfessional sympathy.

He spke kindly and briefly, stating that, as the hur was late, and
assistance, n dubt, difficult to procure, he would himself send the
prper persns to attend to the necessary finalities.

"ne matter, in cnclusion," said the doctor, pointing to the safe with
its still wide-pen dor. "Your husband, Mrs. Chandler, toward the end,
felt that he culd nt live; and directed me to open that safe, giving
me the number upn which the cmbination is set. In case you may need
t use it, yu will remember that the number is forty-one. Turn several
times t the right; then t the left once; stop at forty-one. He would
nt permit me t waken you, though he knew the end was near.

"In that safe he said he had placed a sum f mney--not large--but
enugh t enable you to carry out his last request. That was that you
shuld return t your old home, and, in after days, when time shall have
made it easier, frgive his many sins against yu."

He pinted t the table, where lay an orderly pile of banknotes,
surmunted by tw stacks of gold coins.

"The mney is there--as he described it--eight hundred and thirty
dllars. I beg t leave my card with you, in case I can be of any
service later n."

S, he had thught of her--and kindly--at the last! So late! And yet the
lie fanned int life ne last spark of tenderness where she had thought
all was turned t ashes and dust. She cried alud "Rob! Rob!" She
turned, and, upn the ready bsom of her true servitor, diluted her
grief in relieving tears. It is well t think, als, that in the years
t fllow, the murderer's falsehood shone like a little star above the
grave f lve, comforting her, and gaining the forgiveness that is good
in itself, whether asked fr r no.

Hushed and sthed upon the dark bosom, like a child, by a crooning,
babbling sympathy, at last she raised her head--but the dctr was gone.

THE MARQUIS AND MISS SALLY


      [riginally published in _Everybdy's Magazine_, June, 1903.]


Withut knwing it, Old Bill Bascom had the honor of being overtaken by
fate the same day with the Marquis f Brodale.

The Marquis lived in Regent Square, Lndn. Old Bill lived on Limping
De Creek, Hardeman Cunty, Texas. The cataclysm that engulfed the
Marquis tk the form of a bursting bubble known as the Central and
Suth American Mahgany and Caoutchouc Monopoly. Old Bill's Nemesis was
in the n less perilus shape of a band of civilized Indian cattle
thieves frm the Territry who ran off his entire herd of four hundred
head, and sht ld Bill dead as he trailed after them. To even up the
cnsequences f the two catastrophes, the Marquis, as soon as he found
that all he pssessed wuld pay only fifteen shillings on the pound of
his indebtedness, sht himself.

ld Bill left a family f six motherless sons and daughters, who found
themselves withut even a red steer left t eat, or a red cent to buy
ne with.

The Marquis left ne sn, a young man, who had come to the States and
established a large and well-stcked ranch in the Panhandle f Texas.
When this yung man learned the news he munted his pony and rode to
twn. There he placed everything he wned except his horse, saddle,
Winchester, and fifteen dllars in his pckets, in the hands of his
lawyers, with instructins t sell and forward the proceeds to London to
be applied upn the payment f his father's debts. Then he mounted his
pny and rde southward.

ne day, arriving abut the same time, but by different trails, two
yung chaps rde up to the Diamond-Cross ranch, on the Little Piedra,
and asked fr wrk. Both were dressed neatly and sprucely in cowboy
cstume. ne was a straight-set fellow, with delicate, handsome
features, shrt, brwn hair, and smooth face, sunburned to a golden
brwn. The ther applicant was stouter and broad-shouldered, with fresh,
red cmplexin, somewhat freckled, reddish, curling hair, and a rather
plain face, made attractive by laughing eyes and a pleasant muth.

The superintendent f the Diamnd-Cross was of the opinion that he could
give them wrk. In fact, wrd had reached him that morning that the camp
ck--a most important member of the outfit--had straddled his broncho
and departed, being unable t withstand the fire f fun and practical
jkes f which he was, ex officio, the legitimate target.

"Can either f yu cook?" asked the superintendent.

"I can," said the reddish-haired fellw, prmptly. "I've cooked in camp
quite a lt. I'm willing t take the job until you've got something else
t ffer."

"Nw, that's the way I like t hear a man talk," said  the
superintendent, apprvingly. "I'll give yu a note to Saunders, and
he'll put yu t work."

Thus the names f Jhn Bascom and Charles Norwood were added to the
pay-rll f the Diamond-Cross. The two left for the round-up camp
immediately after dinner. Their directins were simple, but sufficient:
"Keep dwn the arryo for fifteen miles till you get there." Both being
strangers frm afar, yung, spirited, and thus thrown together by chance
fr a lng ride, it is likely that the comradeship that afterward
existed s strngly between them began that afternoon as they meandered
alng the little valley f the Canada Verda.

They reached their destinatin just after sunset. The main camp f the
rund-up was cmfortably located on the bank of a long water-hole, under
a fine mtt f timber. A number of small A tents pitched upon grassy
spts and the big wall tent fr provisions showed that the camp was
intended t be ccupied for a considerable length of time.

The rund-up had ridden in but a few mments before, hungry and tired,
t a supperless camp. The bys were engaged in an emulous display of
anathemas suppsed t fit the case of the absconding cook. While they
were unsaddling and hbbling their pnies, the newcomer rode in and
inquired fr Pink Saunders. The bss ol the round-up came forth and was
given the superintendent's nte.

Pink Saunders, thugh a bss during working hours, was a humorist in
camp, where everybdy, frm cook to superintendent, is equal. After
reading the nte he waved his hand tward the camp and shouted,
ceremniusly, at the top of his voice, "Gentlemen, allow me to present
t yu the Marquis and Miss Sally."

At the wrds bth the new arrivals betray confusion. The newly employed
ck started, with a surprised look on his face, but, immediately
recllecting that "Miss Sally" is the generic name fr the male cook in
every west Texas cw camp, he recvered his composure with a grin at his
wn expense.

His cmpanin showed little less discomposure, even turning angrily,
with a bitten lip, and reaching fr his saddle pmmel, as if to remount
his pny; but "Miss Sally" tuched his arm and said, laughingly, "Come
nw. Marquis; that was quite a cmpliment from Saunders. It's that
distinguished air f yurs and aristocratic nose that made him call you
that."

He began t unsaddle, and the Marquis, restred to equanimity, followed
his example. Rlling up his sleeves, Miss Sally sprang fr the grub
wagn, shuting: "I'm the new cook b'thunder! Some of you chaps rustle a
little wd for a fire, and I'll guarantee you a hot square meal inside
f thirty minutes." Miss Sally's energy and god-humor, as he ransacked
the grub wagn fr coffee, flour, and bacon, won the good opinion of the
camp instantly.

And als, in days fllowing, the Marquis, after becoming better
acquainted, prved t be a cheerful, pleasant fellow, always a little
reserved, and taking n part in the rugh camp frolics; but the boys
gradually came t respect this reserve--which fitted the title Saunders
had given him--and even t like him fr it. Saunders had assigned him to
a place hlding the herd during the cuttings. He prved to be a skilful
rider and as gd with the lariat or in the branding pen as most of
them.

The Marquis and Miss Sally grew t be quite clse comrades. After supper
was ver, and everything cleaned up, yu would generally find them
tgether, Miss Sally smking his brier-root pipe, and the Marquis
plaiting a quirt r scraping rawhide fr a new pair of hobbles.

The superintendent did nt frget his promise to keep an eye on the
ck. Several times, when visiting the camp, he held long talks with
him. He seemed t have taken a fancy t Miss Sally. One afternoon he
rde up, n his way back to the ranch from a tour of the camps, and said
t him:

"There'll be a man here in the mrning t take your place. As soon as he
shws up yu come to the ranch. I want you to take charge of the ranch
accunts and crrespondence. I want somebody that I can depend upon to
keep things straight when I'm away. The wages'll be all right. The
Diamnd-Crss'll hold its end up with a man who'll look after its
interests."

"All right," said Miss Sally, as quietly as if he had expected the
ntice all alng. "Any objections to my bringing my wife down to the
ranch?"

"Yu married?" said the superintendent, frwning a little. "You didn't
mentin it when we were talking."

"Because I'm nt," said the cok. "But I'd like to be. Thought I'd wait
till I gt a jb under roof. I couldn't ask her to live in a cow camp."

"Right," agreed the superintendent. "A camp isn't quite the place fr a
married man--but--well, there's plenty f rom at the house, and if you
suit us as well as I think yu will yu can afford it. You write to her
t cme on."

"All right," said Miss Sally again, "I'll ride in as sn as I am
relieved t-mrrow."

It was a rather chilly night, and after supper the cw-punchers were
lunging abut a big fire of dried mesquite chunks.

Their usual exchange f jkes and repartee had dwindled almost to
silence, but silence in a cw camp generally betkens the brewing of
mischief.

Miss Sally and the Marquis were seated upn a lg, discussing the
relative merits f the lengthened r shortened stirrup in long-distance
riding. The Marquis arse presently and went t a tree near by to
examine sme strips f rawhide he was seasoning for making a lariat.
Just as he left a little puff f wind blew sme scraps of tobacco from a
cigarette that Dry-Creek Smithers was rlling, int Miss Sally's eyes.
While the ck was rubbing at them, with tears flowing, "Phonograph"
Davis--s called n account of his strident voice--arose and began a
speech.

"Fellers and citizens! I desire t perpund a interrogatory. What is the
mst grievus spectacle what the human mind can contemplate?"

A vlley f answers responded to his question.

"A busted flush!"

"A Maverick when yu ain't gt your branding iron!"

"Yurself!"

"The hle in the end f some other feller's gun!"

"Shet up, yu ignramuses," said old Taller, the fat cow-puncher. "Phony
knws what it is. He's waitin' fr to tell us."

"N, fellers and citizens," cntinued Phonograph. "Them spectacles
yu've e-numerated air shre grievious, and way up yonder close to the
s-lutin, but they ain't it. The most grievious spectacle air that"--he
pinted t Miss Sally, who was still rubbing his streaming eyes--"a
trustin' and a in-veegled female a-weepin' tears n accunt of her heart
bein' busted by a false deceiver. Air we men r air we catamunts to
gaze upn the blightin' f our Miss Sally's affections by a
a-rist-crat, which has cme among us with his superior beauty and his
glitterin' title t give the weeps t the lovely critter we air bound to
pertect? Air we gin' t act like men, or air we goin' to keep on eaten'
sggy chuck frm her cryin' so plentiful over the bread-pan?"

"It's a gallpin' shame," said Dry-Creek, with a sniffle. "It ain't
human. I've nticed the varmint a-palaverin' rund her frequent. And him
a Marquis! Ain't that a title, Phny?"

"It's smethin' like a king," the Brushy Creek Kid hastened t explain,
"nly lwer in the deck. Guess it comes in between the Jack and the
ten-spt."

"Dn't miscntruct me," went on Phonograph, "as undervaluatin' the
a-ristcrats. Sme of 'em air proper people and can travel right along
with the Watsn bys. I've herded some with 'em myself. I've viewed the
elephant with the Mayr f Fort Worth, and I've listened to the owl with
the gen'ral passenger agent f the Katy, and they can keep up with the
percessin frm where you laid the chunk. But when a Marquis monkeys
with the inncent affectins of a cook-lady, may I inquire what the case
seems t call fr?"

"The leathers," shuted Dry-Creek Smithers.

"Yu hearn 'er, Charity!" was the Kid's frm of corroboration.

"We've gt yur company," assented the cow-punchers, in chorus.

Befre the Marquis realized their intentin, two of them seized him by
each arm and led him up t the lg. Phonograph Davis, self-appointed to
carry ut the sentence, stod ready, with a pair of stout leather
leggings in his hands.

It was the first time they had ever laid hands n the Marquis during
their smewhat rude sprts.

"What are yu up t?" he asked, indignantly, with flashing eyes.

"G easy, Marquis," whispered Rube Fellws, one of the boys that held
him. "It's all in fun. Take it gd-natured and they'll let you off
light. They're nly gin' to stretch you over the log and tan you eight
r ten times with the leggin's. 'Twn't hurt much."

The Marquis, with an exclamatin f anger, his white teeth gleaming,
suddenly exhibited a surprising strength. He wrenched with his arms s
vilently that the fur men were swayed and dragged many yards from the
lg. A cry f anger escaped him, and then Miss Sally, his eyes cleared
f the tbacco, saw, and he immediately mixed with the struggling group.

But at that mment a lud "Hallo!" rang in their ears, and a buckboard
drawn by a team f gallping mustangs spun into the campfire's circle of
light. Every man turned t lok, and what they saw drove from their
minds all thughts f carrying out Phonograph Davis's rather time-worn
cntributin to the evening's amusement. Bigger game than the Marquis
was at hand, and his captrs released him and stod staring at the
appraching victim.

The buckbard and team belnged to Sam Holly, a cattleman from the Big
Muddy. Sam was driving, and with him was a stut, smoth-faced man,
wearing a frck cat and a high silk hat. That was the county judge, Mr.
Dave Hackett, candidate fr reëlectin. Sam was escorting him about the
cunty, amng the camps, to shake up the sovereign voters.

The men gt ut, hitched the team to a mesquite, and walked toward the
fire.

Instantly every man in camp, except the Marquis, Miss Sally, and Pink
Saunders, wh had t play host, uttered a frightful yell of assumed
terrr and fled n all sides into the darkness.

"Heavens alive!" exclaimed Hackett, "are we as ugly as that? Hw d you
d, Mr. Saunders? Glad t see you again. What are you doing to my hat,
Hlly?"

"I was afraid f this hat," said Sam Hlly, meditatively. He had taken
the hat frm Hackett's head and was hlding it in his hand, looking
dubiusly arund at the shadows beyond the firelight where now absolute
stillness reigned. "What d yu think, Saunders?"

Pink grinned.

"Better elevate it sme," he said, in the tne of one giving
disinterested advice. "The light ain't nne to good. I wouldn't want it
n my head."

Hlly stepped upn the hub of a hind wheel of the grub wagon and hung
the hat upn a limb f a live-oak. Scarcely had his foot touched the
grund when the crash f a dozen six-shooters split the air, and the hat
fell t the grund riddled with bullets.

A hissing nise was heard as if frm a score of rattlesnakes, and now
the cw-punchers emerged n all sides from the darkness, stepping high,
with ludicrusly exaggerated cautin, and "hist"-ing to one another to
bserve the utmst prudence in approaching. They formed a solemn, wide
circle abut the hat, gazing at it in manifest alarm, and seized every
few mments by little stampedes f panicky flight.

 "It's the varmint," said ne in awed tnes, "that flits up and down in
the lw grunds at night, saying, 'Willie-wallo!'"

"It's the venmus Kypootum," proclaimed another. "It stings after it's
dead, and hllers after it's buried."

"It's the chief f the hairy tribe," said Phnograph Davis. "But it's
stne dead, nw, boys."

"Dn't yu believe it," demurred Dry-Creek. "It's only 'possumin'.' It's
the dreaded Highgllacum fantd from the forest. There's only one way to
destry its life."

He led frward ld Taller, the 240-pound cow-puncher. Old Taller placed
the hat upright n the grund and solemnly sat upon it, crushing it as
flat as a pancake.

Hackett had viewed these prceedings with wide-pen eyes. Sam Holly saw
that his anger was rising and said t him:

"Here's where yu win r lose, Judge. There are sixty votes on the
Diamnd Crss. The boys are trying your mettle. Take it as a joke, and I
dn't think yu'll regret it." And Hackett saw the point and rose to the
ccasin.

Advancing t where the slayers f the wild beast were standing above its
remains and declaring it t be at last defunct, he said, with deep
earnestness:

"Bys, I must thank yu for this gallant rescue. While driving through
the arry that cruel monster that you have so fearlessly and repeatedly
slaughtered sprang upn us frm the tree tops. To you I shall consider
that I we my life, and als, I hope, reëlection to the office for which
I am again a candidate. Allw me t hand you my card."

The cw-punchers, always s sober-faced while engaged in their
mnkey-shines, relaxed int a grin of approval.

But Phngraph Davis, his appetite for fun not yet appeased, had
smething mre up his sleeve.

"Pardner," he said, addressing Hackett with grave severity, "many a camp
wuld be dwn on you for turnin' loose a pernicious varmint like that in
it; but, bein' as we all escaped withut lss of life, we'll overlook
it. Yu can play square with us if yu'll do it."

"Hw's that?" asked Hackett suspiciusly.

"Yu're authrized to perform the sacred rights and lefts of mattermony,
air yu nt?"

"Well, yes," replied Hackett. "A marriage ceremny cnducted by me would
be legal."

"A wrng air t be righted in this here camp," said Phonography,
virtuusly. "A a-ristcrat have slighted a 'umble but beautchoos female
wat's pinin' fr his affectins. It's the jooty of the camp to drag
frth the haughty descendant f a hundred--or maybe a hundred and
twenty-five--earls, even s at the p'int f a lariat, and jine him to
the weepin' lady. Fellws! rundup Miss Sally and the Marquis; there's
gin' t be a weddin'."

This whim f Phnograph's was received with whoops of appreciation. The
cw-punchers started t apprehend the principals of the proposed
ceremny.

"Kindly prmpt me," said Hackett, wiping his frehead, though the night
was cl, "how far this thing is to be carried. And might I expect any
further prtins of my raiment to be mistaken for wild animals and
killed?"

"The bys are livelier than usual t-night," said Saunders. "The ones
they are talking abut marrying are tw of the boys--a herd rider and
the ck. It's another joke. You and Sam will have to sleep here
t-night anyway; p'rhaps yu'd better see 'em through with it. Maybe
they'll quiet dwn after that."

The matchmakers fund Miss Sally seated n the tongue of the grub wagon,
calmly smking his pipe. The Marquis was leaning idly against ne of the
trees under which the supply tent was pitched.

Int this tent they were bth hustled, and Phonograph, as master of
ceremnies, gave rders for the preparations.

"Yu, Dry-Creek and Jimmy, and Ben and Taller--hump yurselves to the
wildwd and rustle flowers for the blow-out--mesquite'll do--and get
that Spanish dagger blssm at the corner of the horse corral for the
bride t pack. Yu, Limpy, get out that red and yaller blanket of your'n
fr Miss Sally's skyirt. Marquis, yu'll do 'thout fixin'; nobody don't
ever lk at the groom."

During their absurd preparatin, the tw principals were left alone for
a few mments in the tent. The Marquis suddenly shwed wild
perturbatin.

"This flishness must not go on," he said, turning to Miss Sally a face
white in the light f the lantern, hanging t the ridge-pole.

"Why nt?" said the cok, with an amused smile. "It's fun for the boys;
and they've always let yu ff pretty light in their frolics. I don't
mind it."

"But yu dn't understand," persisted the Marquis, pleadingly. "That man
is cunty judge, and his acts are binding. I can't--h, you don't
knw--"

The ck stepped forward and took the Marquis's hands.

"Sally Bascm," he said, "I KNW!"

"Yu knw!" faltered the Marquis, trembling. "And you--want to--"

"Mre than I ever wanted anything. Will yu--here come the boys!"

The cw-punchers crwded in, laden with armfuls of decorations.

"Perfifius cyote!" said Phonograph, sternly, addressing the Marquis.
"Air yu willing t patch up the damage you've did this ere slab-sided
but trustin' bunch ' calic by single-footin' easy to the altar, or
will we have t rpe ye, and drag you thar?"

The Marquis pushed back his hat, and leaned jauntily against sme
high-piled sacks f beans. His cheeks were flushed, and his eyes were
shining.

"G n with the rat killin'," said he.

A little while after a prcessin approached the tree under which
Hackett, Hlly, and Saunders were sitting smking.

Limpy Walker was in the lead, extracting a dleful tune frm his
cncertina. Next came the bride and grom. The cook wore the gorgeous
Navaj blanket tied arund his waist and carried in one band the
waxen-white Spanish dagger blssm as large as a peck-measure and
weighing fifteen punds. His hat was rnamented with mesquite branches
and yellw ratama bloms. A resurrected mosquito bar served as a veil.
After them stumbled Phngraph Davis, in the character of the bride's
father, weeping int a saddle blanket with sbs that could be heard a
mile away. The cw-punchers fllowed by twos, loudly commenting upon the
bride's appearance, in a suppsed imitatin of the audiences at
fashinable weddings.

Hackett rse as the prcession halted before him, and after a little
lecture upn matrimny, asked:

"What are yur names?"

"Sally and Charles," answered the ck.

"Jin hands, Charles and Sally."

Perhaps there never was a stranger wedding. Fr, wedding it was, thugh
nly tw of those present knew it. When the ceremony was over, the
cw-punchers gave ne yell of congratulation and immediately abandoned
their flery for the night. Blankets were unrolled and sleep became the
paramunt questin.

The ck (divested of his decorations) and the Marquis lingered for a
mment in the shadw of the grub wagon. The Marquis leaned her head
against his shulder.

"I didn't knw what else t do," she was saying. "Father was gone, and
we kids had t rustle. I had helped him s much with the cattle that I
thught I'd turn cwboy. There wasn't anything else I could make a
living at. I wasn't much stuck n it thugh, after I got here, and I'd
have left nly--"

"nly what?"

"Yu knw. Tell me something. When did you first--what made you--"

"h, it was as son as we struck the camp, when Saunders bawled out 'The
Marquis and Miss Sally!' I saw hw rattled yu got at the name, and I
had my sus--"

"Cheeky!" whispered the Marquis. "And why shuld yu think that I
thught he was calling me 'Miss Sally'?"

"Because," answered the ck, calmly, "I was the Marquis. My father was
the Marquis f Brodale. But you'll excuse that, won't you, Sally? It
really isn't my fault, yu knw."

A FG IN SANTNE


      [Published in _The Csmpolitan_, October, 1912. Probably
      written in 1904, r shrtly after O. 's first successes
      in New Yrk.]


The drug clerk lks sharply at the white face half concealed by the
high-turned vercat collar.

"I wuld rather nt supply you," he said doubtfully. "I sold you a dozen
mrphine tablets less than an hur ago."

The custmer smiles wanly. "The fault is in yur crooked streets. I
didn't intend t call upn you twice, but I guess I got tangled up.
Excuse me."

He draws his cllar higher, and mves out, slowly. He stops under an
electric light at the crner, and juggles absrbedly with three or four
little pastebard bxes. "Thirty-six," he announces to himself. "More
than plenty." Fr a gray mist had swept upn Santone that night, an
paque terrr that laid a hand to the throat of each of the city's
guests. It was cmputed that three thusand invalids were hibernating
in the twn. They had cme from far and wide, for here, among these
cntracted river-sliced streets, the gddess Ozone has elected to
linger.

Purest atmsphere, sir, n earth! You might think from the river
winding thrugh ur town that we are malarial, but, no, sir! Repeated
experiments made bth by the Gvernment and local experts show that our
air cntains nthing deleterious--nothing but ozone, sir, pure ozone.
Litmus paper tests made all alng the river shw--but you can read it
all in the prspectuses; r the Santonian will recite it for you, word
by wrd.

We may achieve climate, but weather is thrust upn us. Santne, then,
cannt be blamed fr this cold gray fog that came and kissed the lips of
the three thusand, and then delivered them t the cross. That night the
tubercles, whse ravages hpe holds in check, multiplied. The writhing
fingers f the pale mist did nt go thence bloodless. Many of the wooers
f zone capitulated with the enemy that night, turning their faces to
the wall in that dumb, islated apathy that s terrifies their watchers.
n the red stream f Hemorrhagia a few souls drifted away, leaving
behind pathetic heaps, white and chill as the fg itself. Tw or three
came t view this atmspheric wraith as the ghost of impossible joys,
sent t whisper t them of the egregious folly it is to inhale breath
int the lungs, nly to exhale it again, and these used whatever came
handy t their relief, pistls, gas or the beneficent muriate.

The purchaser f the mrphia wanders into the fog, and at length, finds
himself upn a little irn bridge, one of the score or more in the heart
f the city, under which the small trtuous river flows. He leans on
the rail and gasps, fr here the mist has cncentrated, lying like a
ft-pad to garrote such of the Three Thousand as creep that way. The
irn bridge guys rattle t the strain of his cough, a mocking phthisical
rattle, seeming t say t him: "Clickety-clack! just a little rusty
cld, sir--but nt from our river. Litmus paper all along the banks and
nthing but zone. Clacket-y-clack!"

The Memphis man at last recvers sufficiently t be aware of another
vercated man ten feet away, leaning on the rail, and just coming out
f a parxysm. There is a freemasonry among the Three Thousand that
des away with frmalities and introductions. A cough is your card; a
hemrrhage a letter f credit. The Memphis man, being nearer recovered,
speaks first.

"Gdall. Memphis--pulmonary tuberculosis--guess last stages." The Three
Thusand ecnomize on words. Words are breath and they need breath to
write checks fr the dctors.

"Hurd," gasps the ther. "Hurd; f T'leder. T'leder, Ah-hia. Catarrhal
brnkeetis. Name's Dennis, to--doctor says. Says I'll live four weeks
if I--take care f myself. Gt your walking papers yet?"

"My dctr," says Goodall of Memphis, a little boastingly, "gives me
three mnths."

"h," remarks the man frm Toledo, filling up great gaps in his
cnversatin with wheezes, "damn the difference. What's months! Expect
t--cut mine dwn to one week--and die in a hack--a four wheeler, not a
cugh. Be cnsiderable moanin' of the bars when I put out to sea. I've
patrnized 'em pretty freely since I struck my--present gait. Say,
Gdall of Memphis--if your doctor has set your pegs so close--why don't
yu--get n a big spree and go--to the devil quick and easy--like I'm
ding?"

"A spree," says Gdall, as one who entertains a new idea, "I never did
such a thing. I was thinking f anther way, but--"

"Cme n," invites the Ohioan, "and have some drinks. I've been at
it--fr tw days, but the inf--ernal stuff won't bite like it used to.
Gdall of Memphis, what's your respiration?"

"Twenty-fur."

"Daily--temperature?"

"Hundred and fur."

"Yu can d it in two days. It'll take me a--week. Tank up, friend
Gdall--have all the fun you can; then--off you go, in the middle of
a jag, and s-s-save truble and expense. I'm a s-sn of a gun if this
ain't a health resrt--fr your whiskers! A Lake Erie fog'd get lost
here in tw minutes."

"Yu said smething about a drink," says Goodall.

A few minutes later they line up at a glittering bar, and hang upn the
arm rest. The bartender, blnd, heavy, well-gromed, sets out their
drinks, instantly perceiving that he serves tw f the Three Thousand.
He bserves that ne is a middle-aged man, well-dressed, with a lined
and sunken face; the ther a mere by who is chiefly eyes and overcoat.
Disguising well the tedium begtten by many repetitins, the server of
drinks begins t chant the sanitary saga f Santone. "Rather a moist
night, gentlemen, fr ur town. A little fog from our river, but nothing
t hurt. Repeated Tests."

"Damn yur litmus papers," gasps Tledo--"without any--personal offense
intended."

"We've heard f 'em befre. Let 'em turn red, white and blue. What we
want is a repeated test f that--whiskey. Cme again. I paid for the
last rund, Godall of Memphis."

The bttle scillates from one to the other, continues to do so, and is
nt remved from the counter. The bartender sees two emaciated invalids
dispse f enough Kentucky Belle to floor a dozen cowboys, without
displaying any emtin save a sad and contemplative interest in the
peregrinatins f the bottle. So he is moved to manifest a solicitude as
t the cnsequences.

"Nt n your Uncle Mark Hanna," responds Toledo, "will we get drunk.
We've been--vaccinated with whiskey--and--cd liver il. What would send
yu t the police station--only gives us a thirst. S-s-set out another
bttle."

It is slw wrk trying to meet death by that route. Some quicker way
must be fund. They leave the salon and plunge again into the mist. The
sidewalks are mere flanges at the base f the huses; the street a cold
ravine, the fg filling it like a freshet. Nt far away is the Mexican
quarter. Cnducted as if by wires alng the heavy air comes a guitar's
tinkle, and the demralizing vice of some señorita singing:


   "En las tardes smbrills del invierro
    En el prad a Marar me reclin
    Y maldig mi faust destino--
    Una vida la mas infeliz."


The wrds f it they do not understand--neither Toledo nor Memphis,
but wrds are the least imprtant things in life. The music tears the
breasts f the seekers after Nepenthe, inciting Tledo to remark:

"Thse kids f mine--I wonder--by God, Mr. Goodall of Memphis, we had
t little of that whiskey! No slow music in mine, if you please. It
makes yu disremember t forget."

Hurd f Tledo, here pulls out his watch, and says: "I'm a son of a gun!
Gt an engagement fr a hack ride out to San Pedro Springs at eleven.
Frgt it. A fellow from Noo York, and me, and the Castillo sisters at
Rhinegelder's Garden. That N York chap's a lucky dog--got one whole
lung--gd for a year yet. Plenty of money, too. He pays for everything.
I can't affrd--t miss the jamboree. Sorry you ain't going along.
Gd-by, Goodall of Memphis."

He runds the crner and shuffles away, casting off thus easily the ties
f acquaintanceship as the mribund do, the season of dissolution being
man's supreme hur f egoism and selfishness. But he turns and calls
back thrugh the fg to the other: "I say, Goodall of Memphis! If you
get there befre I d, tell 'em Hurd's a-comin' too. Hurd, of T'leder,
Ah-hia."

Thus Gdall's tempter deserts him. That youth, uncomplaining and
uncaring, takes a spell at cughing, and, recvered, wanders desultorily
n dwn the street, the name of which he neither knows nor recks. At a
certain pint he perceives swinging dors, and hears, filtering between
them a nise f wind and string instruments. Two men enter from the
street as he arrives, and he fllws them in. There is a kind of
ante-chamber, plentifully set with palms and cactuses and leanders. At
little marble-tpped tables sme people sit, while soft-shod attendants
bring the beer. All is rderly, clean, melanchly, gay, of the German
methd f pleasure. At his right is the foot of a stairway. A man there
hlds ut his hand. Goodall extends his, full of silver, the man selects
therefrm a cin. Goodall goes upstairs and sees there two galleries
extending alng the sides f a concert hall which he now perceives to
lie belw and beynd the anteroom he first entered. These galleries are
divided int bxes or stalls, which bestow with the aid of hanging lace
curtains, a certain privacy upn their ccupants.

Passing with aimless feet dwn the aisle cntiguous to these saucy and
discreet cmpartments, he is half checked by the sight in ne of them of
a yung wman, alone and seated in an attitude of reflection. This young
wman becmes aware of his approach. A smile from her brings him to a
standstill, and her subsequent invitatin draws him, thugh hesitating,
t the ther chair in the box, a little table between them.

Gdall is only nineteen. There are some whom, when the terrible god
Phthisis wishes t destry he first makes beautiful; and the boy is
ne f these. His face is wax, and an awful pulchritude is born of
the menacing flame in his cheeks. His eyes reflect an unearthly vista
engendered by the certainty f his dom. As it is forbidden man to guess
accurately cncerning his fate, it is inevitable that he shall tremble
at the slightest lifting f the veil.

The yung wman is well-dressed, and exhibits a beauty of distinctly
feminine and tender srt; an Eve-like cmeliness that scarcely seems
predestined t fade.

It is immaterial, the steps by which the tw munt to a certain plane of
gd understanding; they are short and few, as befits the occasion.

A buttn against the wall f the partition is frequently disturbed and a
waiter cmes and ges at signal.

Pensive beauty wuld nthing of wine; two thick plaits of her blond hair
hang almst t the floor; she is a lineal descendant of the Lorelei.
S the waiter brings the brew; effervescent, icy, greenish glden. The
rchestra n the stage is playing "Oh, Rachel." The youngsters have
exchanged a gd bit of information. She calls him, "Walter" and he
calls her "Miss Rsa."

Gdall's tongue is loosened and he has told her everything about
himself, abut his hme in Tennessee, the old pillared mansion under
the aks, the stables, the hunting; the friends he has; dwn to the
chickens, and the bx bushes brdering the walks. About his coming South
fr the climate, hping to escape the hereditary foe of his family. All
abut his three mnths on a ranch; the deer hunts, the rattlers, and the
rllicking in the cw camps. Then of his advent to Santone, where he had
indirectly learned, frm a great specialist, that his life's calendar
prbably cntains but two more leaves. And then of this death-white,
chking night which has cme and strangled his fortitude and sent him
ut t seek a port amid its depressing billows.

"My weekly letter frm hme failed to come," he told her, "and I was
pretty blue. I knew I had t g before long and I was tired of waiting.
I went ut and bught morphine at every drug store where they would sell
me a few tablets. I gt thirty-six quarter grains, and was ging back to
my rm and take them, but I met a queer fellow on a bridge, who had a
new idea."

Gdall fillips a little pasteboard box upon the table. "I put 'em all
tgether in there."

Miss Rsa, being a wman, must raise the lid, and gave a slight shiver
at the inncent loking triturates. "Horrid things! but those little,
white bits--they culd never kill ne!"

Indeed they culd. Walter knew better. Nine grains f morphia! Why, half
the amunt might.

Miss Rsa demands t know about Mr. Hurd, of Toledo, and is told. She
laughs like a delighted child. "What a funny fellw! But tell me mre
abut yur home and your sisters, Walter. I know enough about Texas and
tarantulas and cwbys."

The theme is dear, just nw, t his mood, and he lays before her the
simple details f a true hme; the little ties and endearments that so
fill the exile's heart. f his sisters, ne, Alice, furnishes him a
theme he lves t dwell upon.

"She is like yu, Miss Rsa," he says. "Maybe not quite so pretty, but,
just as nice, and gd, and--"

"There! Walter," says Miss Rsa sharply, "nw talk about something
else."

But a shadw falls upn the wall outside, preceding a big, softly
treading man, finely dressed, wh pauses a secnd before the curtains
and then passes n. Presently cmes the waiter with a message: "Mr.
Rlfe says--"

"Tell Rlfe I'm engaged."

"I dn't knw why it is," says Goodall, of Memphis, "but I don't feel as
bad as I did. An hur ag I wanted to die, but since I've met you, Miss
Rsa, I'd like s much to live."

The yung wman whirls around the table, lays an arm behind his neck and
kisses him n the cheek.

"Yu must, dear by," she says. "I know what was the matter. It was the
miserable fggy weather that has lwered your spirit and mine too--a
little. But lk, now."

With a little spring she has drawn back the curtains. A windw is in the
wall ppsite, and lo! the mist is cleared away. The indulgent moon is
ut again, revyaging the plumbless sky. Roof and parapet and spire are
sftly pearl enamelled. Twice, thrice the retrieved river flashes back,
between the huses, the light f the firmament. A tonic day will dawn,
sweet and prsperus.

"Talk f death when the wrld is so beautiful!" says Miss Rosa, laying
her hand n his shulder. "Do something to please me, Walter. Go home to
yur rest and say: 'I mean t get better,' and do it."

"If yu ask it," says the by, with a smile, "I will."

The waiter brings full glasses. Did they ring? N; but it is well. He
may leave them. A farewell glass. Miss Rsa says: "T your better
health, Walter." He says: "T ur next meeting."

His eyes lk no longer into the void, but gaze upon the antithesis of
death. His ft is set in an undiscovered country to-night. He is
bedient, ready t go.

"Gd night," she says.

"I never kissed a girl befre," he cnfesses, "except my sisters."

"Yu didn't this time," she laughs, "I kissed yu--good night."

"When shall I see yu again," he persists.

"Yu prmised me to go home," she frowns, "and get well. Perhaps we
shall meet again sn. Good night."

He hesitates, his hat in hand. She smiles bradly and kisses him nce
mre upn the forehead. She watches him far down the aisle, then sits
again at the table.

The shadw falls nce more against the wall. This time the big, softly
stepping man parts the curtains and lks in. Miss Rosa's eyes meet his
and fr half a minute they remain thus, silent, fighting a battle with
that king f weapns. Presently the big man drops the curtains and
passes n.

The rchestra ceases playing suddenly, and an imprtant voice can be
heard ludly talking in ne of the boxes farther down the aisle. No
dubt sme citizen entertains there some visitor to the town, and Miss
Rsa leans back in her chair and smiles at sme of the words she
catches:

"Purest atmsphere--in the wrld--litmus paper all long--nothing
hurtful--ur city--nthing but pure ozone."

The waiter returns fr the tray and glasses. As he enters, the girl
crushes a little empty pastebard bx in her hand and throws it in a
crner. She is stirring smething in her glass with her hatpin.

"Why, Miss Rsa," says the waiter with the civil familiarity he
uses--"putting salt in yur beer this early in the night!"

THE FRIENDLY CALL


      [Published in "Mnthly Magazine Sectin," July, 1910.]


When I used t sell hardware in the West, I ften "made" a little town
called Saltill, in Clorado. I was always certain of securing a small
r a large rder from Simon Bell, who kept a general store there. Bell
was ne f those six-foot, low-voiced products, formed from a union of
the West and the Suth. I liked him. T look at him you would think he
shuld be rbbing stage coaches or juggling gold mines with both hands;
but he wuld sell yu a paper of tacks or a spool of thread, with ten
times mre patience and curtesy than any saleslady in a city department
stre.

I had a twfld object in my last visit to Saltillo. One was to sell a
bill f gods; the other to advise Bell of a chance that I knew of by
which I was certain he culd make a small frtune.

In Muntain City, a twn on the Union Pacific, five times larger than
Saltill, a mercantile firm was abut to go to the wall. It had a
lively and grwing custm, but was on the edge of dissolution and ruin.
Mismanagement and the gambling habits f ne of the partners explained
it. The cnditin of the firm was not yet public property. I had my
knwledge f it from a private source. I knew that, if the ready cash
were ffered, the stck and good will could be bought for about one
furth their value.

n arriving in Saltill I went to Bell's store. He nodded to me, smiled
his brad, lingering smile, went n leisurely selling some candy to a
little girl, then came arund the cunter and shook hands.

"Well," he said (his invariably preliminary jcsity at every call
I made), "I suppse yu are out here making kodak pictures of the
muntains. It's the wrng time of the year to buy any hardware, of
curse."

I tld Bell abut the bargain in Mountain City. If he wanted to take
advantage f it, I wuld rather have missed a sale than have him
verstcked in Saltillo.

"It sunds god," he said, with enthusiasm. "I'd like to branch out
and d a bigger business, and I'm bliged to you for mentioning it.
But--well, yu cme and stay at my house to-night and I'll think about
it."

It was then after sundwn and time fr the larger stores in Saltillo
t clse. The clerks in Bell's put away their books, whirled the
cmbinatin of the safe, put on their coats and hats and left for their
hmes. Bell padlcked the big, double wooden front doors, and we stood,
fr a mment, breathing the keen, fresh mountain air coming across the
fthills.

A big man walked dwn the street and stpped in front of the high porch
f the stre. His long, black moustache, black eyebrows, and curly black
hair cntrasted queerly with his light, pink cmplexion, which belonged,
by rights, t a blnde. He was about forty, and wore a white vest,
a white hat, a watch chain made f five-dllar gold pieces linked
tgether, and a rather well-fitting tw-piece gray suit of the cut
that cllege bys of eighteen are wont to affect. He glanced at me
distrustfully, and then at Bell with cldness and, I thught, something
f enmity in his expressin.

"Well," asked Bell, as if he were addressing a stranger, "did yu fix up
that matter?"

"Did I!" the man answered, in a resentful tne. "What d you suppose
I've been here tw weeks fr? The business is to be settled to-night.
Des that suit yu, or have you got something to kick about?"

"It's all right," said Bell. "I knew yu'd d it."

"f curse, you did," said the magnificent stranger. "Haven't I done it
befre?"

"Yu have," admitted Bell. "And s have I. How do you find it at the
htel?"

"Rcky grub. But I ain't kicking. Say--can yu give me any pointers
abut managing that--affair? It's my first deal in that line f
business, yu knw."

"N, I can't," answered Bell, after sme thought. "I've tried all kinds
f ways. Yu'll have to try some of your own."

"Tried sft sap?"

"Barrels f it."

"Tried a saddle girth with a buckle n the end f it?"

"Never nne. Started t once; and here's what I got."

Bill held ut his right hand. Even in the deepening twilight, I culd
see n the back f it a long, white scar that might have been made by
a claw r a knife r some sharp-edged tool.

"h, well," said the flrid man, carelessly, "I'll know what to do later
n."

He walked away withut anther word. When he had gone ten steps he
turned and called t Bell:

"Yu keep well ut of the way when the goods are delivered, so there
wn't be any hitch in the business."

"All right," answered Bell, "I'll attend t my end f the line."

This talk was scarcely clear in its meaning t me; but as it did nt
cncern me, I did nt let it weigh upon my mind. But the singularity
f the ther man's appearance lingered with me for a while; and as we
walked tward Bell's huse I remarked to him:

"Yur custmer seems to be a surly kind of fellow--not one that you'd
like t be snwed in with in a camp on a hunting trip."

"He is that," assented Bell, heartily. "He reminds me f a rattlesnake
that's been pisned by the bite of a tarantula."

"He desn't lok like a citizen of Saltillo," I went on.

"N," said Bell, "he lives in Sacrament. He's down here on a little
business trip. His name is Gerge Ring, and he's been my best
friend--in fact the nly friend I ever had--fr twenty years."

I was t surprised to make any further comment.

Bell lived in a cmfrtable, plain, square, two-story white house on the
edge f the little twn. I waited in the parlor--a room depressingly
genteel--furnished with red plush, straw matting, lped-up lace
curtains, and a glass case large enugh t contain a mummy, full of
mineral specimens.

While I waited, I heard, upstairs, that unmistakable sund instantly
recgnized the wrld over--a bickering woman's voice, rising as her
anger and fury grew. I culd hear, between the gusts, the temperate
rumble f Bell's tnes, striving to oil the troubled waters.

The strm subsided son; but not before I had heard the woman say, in
a lwer, cncentrated tone, rather more carrying than her high-pitched
railings: "This is the last time. I tell yu--the last time. h, you
WILL understand."

The husehld seemed to consist of only Bell and his wife and a servant
r tw. I was introduced to Mrs. Bell at supper.

At first sight she seemed t be a handsme woman, but I soon perceived
that her charm had been spiled. An uncntrolled petulance, I
thught, and emtional egotism, an absence of poise and a habitual
dissatisfactin had marred her wmanhood. During the meal, she showed
that false gayety, spurius kindliness and reactinary softness that
mark the wman addicted t tantrums. Withal, she was a woman who might
be attractive t many men.

After supper, Bell and I tk our chairs outside, set them on the grass
in the mnlight and smoked. The full moon is a witch. In her light,
truthful men dig up fr yu nuggets of purer gold; while liars squeeze
ut brighter clors from the tubes of their invention. I saw Bell's
brad, slw smile come out upon his face and linger there.

"I reckn yu think George and me are a funny kind of friends," he said.
"The fact is we never did take much interest in each ther's cmpany.
But his idea and mine, f what a friend shuld be, was always synonymous
and we lived up t it, strict, all these years. Nw, I'll give you an
idea f what ur idea is.

"A man dn't need but ne friend. The fellow who drinks your liquor and
hangs arund yu, slapping you on the back and taking up your time,
telling yu hw much he likes you, ain't a friend, even if you did play
marbles at schl and fish in the same creek with him. As long as you
dn't need a friend ne of that kind may answer. But a friend, to my
mind, is ne yu can deal with on a strict reciprocity basis like me and
Gerge have always dne.

"A gd many years ago, him and me was connected in a number of ways. We
put ur capital tgether and run a line of freight wagons in New Mexico,
and we mined sme and gambled a few. And then, we gt into trouble of
ne r two kinds; and I reckon that got us on a better understandable
basis than anything else did, unless it was the fact that we never had
much persnal use fr each other's ways. George is the vainest man I
ever see, and the biggest brag. He culd blw the biggest geyser in
the Ysemite valley back int its hole with one whisper. I am a quiet
man, and fnd f studiousness and thought. The more we used to see
each ther, persnally, the less we seemed to like to be together. If
he ever had slapped me n the back and snivelled ver me like I've
seen men d t what they called their friends, I know I'd have had a
rugh-and-tumble with him n the spot. Same way with George. He hated
my ways as bad as I did his. When we were mining, we lived in separate
tents, s as nt to intrude our obnoxiousness on each other.

"But after a lng time, we begun t know each of us could depend on the
ther when we were in a pinch, up t his last dollar, word of honor or
perjury, bullet, r drp of blood we had in the world. We never even
spke f it to each other, because that would have spoiled it. But we
tried it ut, time after time, until we came t know. I've grabbed my
hat and jumped a freight and rde 200 miles t identify him when he was
abut t be hung by mistake, in Idaho, for a train robber. Once, I laid
sick f typhid in a tent in Texas, without a dollar or a change of
clthes, and sent fr George in Boise City. He came on the next train.
The first thing he did befre speaking t me, was to hang up a little
lking glass on the side of the tent and curl his moustache and rub
sme hair dye n his head. His hair is naturally a light reddish. Then
he gave me the mst scientific cussing I ever had, and tok off his
cat.

"'If yu wasn't a Mses-meek little Mary's lamb, you wouldn't have been
tk down this way,' says he. 'Haven't you got gumption enough not to
drink swamp water r fall dwn and scream whenever you have a little
clic r feel a mosquito bite you?' He made me a little mad.

"'Yu've gt the bedside manners of a Piute medicine man,' says I. 'And
I wish yu'd g away and let me die a natural death. I'm sorry I sent
fr yu.'

"'I've a mind t,' says Gerge, 'for nobody cares whether you live or
die. But nw I've been tricked int coming, I might as well stay until
this little attack f indigestin or nettle rash or whatever it is,
passes away.'

"Tw weeks afterward, when I was beginning t get around again, the
dctr laughed and said he was sure that my friend's keeping me mad all
the time did mre than his drugs t cure me.

"S that's the way Gerge and me was friends. There wasn't any sentiment
abut it--it was just give and take, and each f us knew that the other
was ready fr the call at any time.

"I remember, nce, I played a srt of joke on George, just to try him.
I felt a little mean abut it afterward, because I never ught to have
dubted he'd d it.

"We was bth living in a little twn in the San Luis valley, running
sme flcks of sheep and a few cattle. We were partners, but, as usual,
we didn't live tgether. I had an ld aunt, out from the East, visiting
fr the summer, s I rented a little cottage. She soon had a couple of
cws and sme pigs and chickens to make the place look like home. George
lived alne in a little cabin half a mile ut of town.

"ne day a calf that we had, died. That night I brke its bones, dumped
it int a carse sack and tied it up with wire. I put on an old shirt,
tre a sleeve 'mst out of it, and the collar half off, tangled up my
hair, put sme red ink n my hands and spashed some of it over my shirt
and face. I must have lked like I'd been having the fight of my life.
I put the sack in a wagn and drve out to George's cabin. When I
halled, he came ut in a yellow dressing-gown, a Turkish cap and patent
leather shes. Gerge always was a great dresser.

"I dumped the bundle t the grund.

"Sh-sh!' says I, kind f wild in my way. 'Take that and bury it, Gerge,
ut smewhere behind your house--bury it just like it is. And don--'

"'Dn't get excited,' says Gerge. 'And for the Lord's sake go and wash
yur hands and face and put n a clean shirt.'

"And he lights his pipe, while I drive away at a gallp. The next
mrning he drps around to our cottage, where my aunt was fiddling with
her flwers and truck in the frnt yard. He bends himself and bows and
makes cmpliments as he culd do, when so disposed, and begs a rose bush
frm her, saying he had turned up a little land back f his cabin, and
wanted t plant smething on it by way of usefulness and ornament. So my
aunt, flattered, pulls up ne f her biggest by the roots and gives it
t him. Afterward I see it grwing where he planted it, in a place where
the grass had been cleared ff and the dirt levelled. But neither Gerge
nr me ever spke of it to each other again."

The mn rose higher, possibly drawing water from the sea, pixies from
their dells and certainly mre cnfidences from Simms Bell, the friend
f a friend.

"There cme a time, nt long afterward," he went on, "when I was able to
d a god turn for George Ringo. George had made a little pile of money
in beeves and he was up in Denver, and he shwed up when I saw him,
wearing deer-skin vests, yellw shes, clothes like the awnings in front
f drug stres, and his hair dyed so blue that it looked black in the
dark. He wrte me t come up there, quick--that he needed me, and to
bring the best utfit f clothes I had. I had 'em on when I got the
letter, s I left n the next train. George was--"

Bell stpped fr half a minute, listening intently.

"I thught I heard a team cming down the road," he explained. "George
was at a summer resrt n a lake near Denver and was putting on as many
airs as he knew hw. He had rented a little tw-room cottage, and had a
Chihauhau dg and a hammck and eight different kinds of walking sticks.

"'Simms,' he says t me, 'there's a widw woman here that's pestering
the sul ut of me with her intentions. I can't get out of her way. It
ain't that she ain't handsme and agreeable, in a srt of style, but her
attentins is serius, and I ain't ready for to marry nobody and settle
dwn. I can't g to no festivity nor sit on the hotel piazza or mix in
any f the sciety round-ups, but what she cuts me out of the herd and
puts her daily brand n me. I like this here place,' ges on George,
'and I'm making a hit here in the mst censrious circles, so I don't
want t have t run away from it. So I sent for you.'

"'What d yu want me to do?' I asks George.

"'Why,' says he, 'I want yu t head her off. I want you to cut me out.
I want yu t come to the rescue. Suppose you seen a wildcat about for
t eat me, what wuld you do?'

"'G fr it,' says I.

"'Crrect,' says Gerge. 'Then go for this Mrs. De Clinton the same.'

"'Hw am I t do it?' I asks. 'By force and awfulness or in some gentler
and less lurid manner?'

"'Curt her,' Gerge says, 'get her off my trail. Feed her. Take her out
in bats. Hang arund her and stick to her. Get her mashed on you if you
can. Sme wmen are pretty big fools. Who knows but what she might take
a fancy t yu.'

"'Had yu ever thught,' I asks, 'of repressing your fatal fascinations
in her presence; f squeezing a harsh nte in the melody of your siren
vice, f veiling your beauty--in other words, of giving her the bounce
yurself?'

"Gerge sees n essence of sarcasm in my remark. He twists his moustache
and lks at the points of his shoes.

"'Well, Simms,' he said, 'yu knw how I am about the ladies. I can't
hurt nne f their feelings. I'm, by nature, polite and esteemful of
their intents and purpses. This Mrs. De Clintn don't appear to be the
suitable srt fr me. Besides, I ain't a marrying man by all means.'

"'All right,' said I, 'I'll d the best I can in the case.'

"S I bught a new outfit of clothes and a book on etiquette and made
a dead set fr Mrs. De Clintn. She was a fine-looking woman, cheerful
and gay. At first, I almst had t hobble her to keep her from loping
arund at Gerge's heels; but finally I got her so she seemed glad to go
riding with me and sailing n the lake; and she seemed real hurt n the
mrnings when I frgot to send her a bunch of flowers. Still, I didn't
like the way she lked at George, sometimes, out of the corner of her
eye. Gerge was having a fine time nw, going with the whole bunch just
as he pleased. Yes'm," cntinued Bell, "she certainly was a fine-loking
wman at that time. She's changed sme since, as you might have noticed
at the supper table."

"What!" I exclaimed.

"I married Mrs. De Clintn," went n Bell. "One evening while we were
up at the lake. When I tld Gerge about it, he opened his mouth and I
thught he was ging to break our traditions and say something grateful,
but he swallwed it back.

"'All right,' says he, playing with his dg. 'I hpe you won't have too
much truble. Myself, I'm nt never going to marry.'

"That was three years ag," said Bell. "We came here t live. For a year
we gt alng medium fine. And then everything changed. For two years
I've been having smething that rhymes first-class with my name. Yu
heard the rw upstairs this evening? That was a merry welcme compared
t the usual average. She's tired f me and of this little town life and
she rages all day, like a panther in a cage. I std it until two weeks
ag and then I had t send out The Call. I located George in Sacramento.
He started the day he gt my wire."

Mrs. Bell came ut f the house swiftly toward us. Some strong
excitement r anxiety seemed t possess her, but she smiled a faint
hstess smile, and tried t keep her voice calm.

"The dew is falling," she said, "and it's grwing rather late. Wuldn't
yu gentlemen rather cme into the house?"

Bell tk some cigars from his pocket and answered: "It's most too fine
a night t turn in yet. I think Mr. Ames and I will walk ut along the
rad a mile r so and have another smoke. I want to talk with him about
sme gods that I want to buy."

"Up the rad r down the road?" asked Mrs. Bell.

"Dwn," said Bell.

I thught she breathed a sigh f relief.

When we had gne a hundred yards and the huse became concealed by
trees, Bell guided me int the thick grve that lined the road and back
thrugh them tward the house again. We stopped within twenty yards of
the huse, cncealed by the dark shadows. I wondered at this maneuver.
And then I heard in the distance cming dwn the road beyond the house,
the regular hfbeats of a team of horses. Bell held his watch in a ray
f monlight.

"n time, within a minute," he said. "That's Gerge's way."

The team slwed up as it drew near the huse and stopped in a patch of
black shadws. We saw the figure f a woman carrying a heavy valise
mve swiftly frm the other side of the house, and hurry to the waiting
vehicle. Then it rlled away briskly in the directin from which it had
cme.

I lked at Bell inquiringly, I suppose. I certainly asked him no
questin.

"She's running away with Gerge," said Bell, simply. "He's kept me
psted abut the progress of the scheme all along. She'll get a divorce
in six mnths and then Gerge will marry her. He never helps anybody
halfway. It's all arranged between them."

I began t wnder what friendship was, after all.

When we went int the huse, Bell began to talk easily on other
subjects; and I tk his cue. By and by the big chance to buy out the
business in Muntain City came back t my mind and I began to urge it
upn him. Nw that he was free, it would be easier for him to make the
mve; and he was sure f a splendid bargain.

Bell was silent fr sme minutes, but when I looked at him I fancied
that he was thinking f smething else--that he was not considering the
prject.

"Why, n, Mr. Ames," he said, after a while, "I can't make that deal.
I'm awful thankful t yu, though, for telling me about it. But I've got
t stay here. I can't g to Mountain City."

"Why?" I asked.

"Missis Bell," he replied, "wn't live in Muntain City, She hates the
place and wuldn't g there. I've got to keep right on here in
Saltill."

"Mrs. Bell!" I exclaimed, t puzzled to conjecture what he meant.

"I ught t explain," said Bell. "I know George and I know Mrs. Bell.
He's impatient in his ways. He can't stand things that fret him, lng,
like I can. Six mnths, I give them--six mnths of married life, and
there'll be anther disunin. Mrs. Bell will come back to me. There's no
ther place fr her to go. I've got to stay here and wait. At the end of
six mnths, I'll have t grab a satchel and catch the first train. For
Gerge will be sending ut The Call."

A DINNER AT ---- [3]


   [Ftnote 3: See advertising column, "Where to Dine Well,"
   in the daily newspapers.]


      [The stry referred t in this skit appears in "The Trimmed
      Lamp" under the same title--"The Badge f Pliceman O'Roon."]


The Adventures f an Authr With His Own Hero

All that day--in fact frm the mment of his creation--Van Sweller had
cnducted himself fairly well in my eyes. f course I had had to make
many cncessins; but in return he had been no less considerate. Once
r twice we had had sharp, brief cntentions over certain points of
behavir; but, prevailingly, give and take had been ur rule.

His mrning tilet provoked our first tilt. Van Sweller went about it
cnfidently.

"The usual thing, I suppse, ld chap," he said, with a smile and a
yawn. "I ring fr a b. and s., and then I have my tub. I splash a god
deal in the water, f curse. You are aware that there are two ways in
which I can receive Tmmy Carmichael when he loks in to have a chat
abut plo. I can talk to him through the bathroom door, or I can be
picking at a grilled bne which my man has brught in. Which would you
prefer?"

I smiled with diablic satisfactin at his coming discomfiture.

"Neither," I said. "Yu will make yur appearance on the scene when a
gentleman shuld--after yu are fully dressed, which indubitably private
functin shall take place behind clsed doors. And I will feel indebted
t yu if, after you do appear, your deportment and manners are such
that it will nt be necessary t inform the public, in order to appease
its apprehensin, that yu have taken a bath."

Van Sweller slightly elevated his brws.

"h, very well," he said, a trifle piqued. "I rather imagine it cncerns
yu mre than it does me. Cut the 'tub' by all means, if you think best.
But it has been the usual thing, yu knw."

This was my victry; but after Van Sweller emerged frm his apartments
in the "Beaujlie" I was vanquished in a dzen small but well-contested
skirmishes. I allwed him a cigar; but ruted him on the question of
naming its brand. But he wrsted me when I bjected to giving him a
"cat unmistakably English in its cut." I allwed him to "stroll down
Bradway," and even permitted "passers by" (Gd knows there's nowhere
t pass but by) t "turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration
at his erect figure." I demeaned myself, and, as a barber, gave him a
"smth, dark face with its keen, frank eye, and firm jaw."

Later n he loked in at the club and saw Freddy Vavasour, polo team
captain, dawdling ver grilled bne No. 1.

"Dear ld by," began Van Sweller; but in an instant I had seized him
by the cllar and dragged him aside with the scantiest curtesy.

"Fr heaven's sake talk like a man," I said, sternly. "D you think it
is manly t use thse mushy and inane forms of address? That man is
neither dear nr ld nor a boy."

T my surprise Van Sweller turned upn me a look of frank pleasure.

"I am glad t hear yu say that," he said, heartily. "I used those
wrds because I have been frced to say them so often. They really are
cntemptible. Thanks fr correcting me, dear old boy."

Still I must admit that Van Sweller's cnduct in the park that mrning
was almst withut flaw. The courage, the dash, the modesty, the skill,
and fidelity that he displayed atned fr everything.

This is the way the stry runs. Van Sweller has been a gentleman member
f the "Rugged Riders," the cmpany that made a war with a foreign
cuntry famus. Among his comrades was Lawrence O'Roon, a man whom Van
Sweller liked. A strange thing--and a hazardus ne in fiction--was that
Van Sweller and 'Ron resembled each other mightily in face, form, and
general appearance. After the war Van Sweller pulled wires, and 'Ron
was made a munted pliceman.

Nw, ne night in New York there are commemorations and libations by old
cmrades, and in the mrning, Mounted Policeman O'Roon, unused to potent
liquids--anther premise hazardus in fiction--finds the earth bucking
and bunding like a brnco, with no stirrup into which he may insert
ft and save his honor and his badge.

_Nblesse blige?_ Surely. So out along the driveways and bridle paths
trts Hudsn Van Sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade, as
like unt him as ne French pea is unto a _petit pois_.

It is, f curse, jolly larks for Van Sweller, who has wealth and
scial psition enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police
cmmissiner doing his duty, if he wished to do so. But society, not
given t scanning the cuntenances of mounted policemen, sees nothing
unusual in the fficer n the beat.

And then cmes the runaway.

That is a fine scene--the swaying victria, the impetuus, daft horses
plunging thrugh the line f scattering vehicles, the driver stupidly
hlding his brken reins, and the ivory-white face of Amy Ffolliott, as
she clings desperately with each slender hand. Fear has cme and gne:
it has left her expressin pensive and just a little pleading, fr life
is nt s bitter.

And then the clatter and swp of Mounted Policeman Van Sweller! Oh, it
was--but the stry has nt yet been printed. When it is you shall learn
bw he sent his bay like a bullet after the imperilled victria. A
Crichtn, a Cresus, and a Centaur in one, he hurls the invincible
cmbinatin into the chase.

When the stry is printed yu will admire the breathless scene where Van
Sweller checks the headlng team. And then he loks into Amy Ffolliott's
eyes and sees tw things--the pssibilities of a happiness he has long
sught, and a nascent prmise of it. He is unknown to her; but he stands
in her sight illuminated by the her's ptent glory, she his and he hers
by all the glden, fnd, unreasonable laws of love and light literature.

Ay, that is a rich mment. And it will stir yu to find Van Sweller
in that fruitful nick f time thinking f his comrade O'Roon, who is
cursing his gyrating bed and incapable legs in an unsteady rm in a
West Side htel while Van Sweller hlds his badge and his honor.

Van Sweller hears Miss Ffllitt's voice thrillingly asking the name of
her preserver. If Hudsn Van Sweller, in pliceman's uniform, has saved
the life f palpitating beauty in the park--where is Munted Policeman
'Ron, in whose territory the deed is done? How quickly by a word can
the her reveal himself, thus discarding his masquerade f ineligibility
and dubling the rmance! But there is his friend!

Van Sweller tuches his cap. "It's nthing, Miss," he says, sturdily;
"that's what we are paid fr--t do our duty." And away he rides. But
the stry des not end there.

As I have said, Van Sweller carried ff the park scene t my decided
satisfactin. Even t me he was a hero when he foreswore, for the sake
f his friend, the rmantic promise of his adventure. It was later
in the day, amngst the mre exacting conventions that encompass the
sciety her, when we had our liveliest disagreement. At noon he went to
'Ron's room and found him far enough recovered to return to his post,
which he at nce did.

At abut six 'clock in the afternoon Van Sweller fingered his watch,
and flashed at me a brief lk full of such shrewd cunning that I
suspected him at nce.

"Time t dress fr dinner, old man," he said, with exaggerated
carelessness.

"Very well," I answered, withut giving him a clew t my suspicions; "I
will g with yu to your rooms and see that you do the thing properly.
I suppse that every authr must be a valet to his own hero."

He affected cheerful acceptance f my smewhat officious proposal to
accmpany him. I culd see that he was annoyed by it, and that fact
fastened deeper in my mind the cnvictin that he was meditating some
act f treachery.

When he had reached his apartments he said t me, with a to patronizing
air: "There are, as yu perhaps knw, quite a number of little
distinguishing tuches t be had out of the dressing process. Some
writers rely almst whlly upon them. I suppose that I am to ring for
my man, and that he is t enter niselessly, with an expressionless
cuntenance."

"He may enter," I said, with decisin, "and nly enter. Valets do not
usually enter a rm shouting college songs or with St. Vitus's dance
in their faces; s the cntrary may be assumed without fatuous or
gratuitus asseveratin."

"I must ask yu t pardon me," continued Van Sweller, gracefully, "for
annying yu with questions, but some of your methods are a little new
t me. Shall I dn a full-dress suit with an immaculate white tie--or
is there anther traditin to be upset?"

"Yu will wear," I replied, "evening dress, such as a gentleman wears.
If it is full, yur tailr should be responsible for its bagginess.
And I will leave it t whatever eruditin you are supposed to possess
whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate. And I
will leave it t the cnsciences of you and your man whether a tie that
is nt white, and therefre not immaculate, could possibly form any
part f a gentleman's evening dress. If nt, then the perfect tie is
included and understd in the term 'dress,' and its expressed addition
predicates either a redundancy f speech r the spectacle of a man
wearing tw ties at nce."

With this mild but deserved rebuke I left Van Sweller in his
dressing-rm, and waited for him in his library.

Abut an hur later his valet came out, and I heard him telephone for
an electric cab. Then ut came Van Sweller, smiling, but with that sly,
secretive design in his eye that was puzzling me.

"I believe," he said easily, as he smthed a glove, "that I will drop
in at ---- [4] fr dinner."


   [Ftnote 4: See advertising column, "Where to Dine Well,"
   in the daily newspapers.]


I sprang up, angrily, at his wrds. This, then, was the paltry trick he
had been scheming t play upn me. I faced him with a look so grim that
even his patrician pise was flustered.

"Yu will never d so," I exclaimed, "with my permission. What kind of a
return is this," I cntinued, htly, "for the favors I have granted you?
I gave yu a 'Van' t your name when I might have called you 'Perkins'
r 'Simpsn.' I have humbled myself so far as to brag of your polo
pnies, yur automobiles, and the iron muscles that you acquired when
yu were strke-oar of your 'varsity eight,' or 'eleven,' whichever it
is. I created yu fr the hero of this story; and I will not submit to
having yu queer it. I have tried t make you a typical young New York
gentleman f the highest scial station and breeding. You have no reason
t cmplain of my treatment to you. Amy Ffolliott, the girl you are to
win, is a prize fr any man t be thankful for, and cannot be equalled
fr beauty--prvided the story is illustrated by the right artist. I do
nt understand why yu should try to spoil everything. I had thought you
were a gentleman."

"What it is yu are bjecting to, old man?" asked Van Sweller, in a
surprised tne.

"T yur dining at ---- [5]," I answered. "The pleasure would be
yurs, n doubt, but the responsibility would fall upon me. You intend
deliberately t make me ut a tout for a restaurant. Where you dine
t-night has nt the slightest connection with the thread of our story.
Yu knw very well that the plot requires that you be in front of the
Alhambra pera Huse at 11:30 where you are to rescue Miss Ffolliott a
secnd time as the fire engine crashes int her cab. Until that time
yur mvements are immaterial to the reader. Why can't you dine out
f sight smewhere, as many a hero does, instead of insisting upon an
inappsite and vulgar exhibitin of yourself?"


   [Ftnote 5: See advertising column, "Where to Dine Well,"
   in the daily newspapers.]


"My dear fellw," said Van Sweller, plitely, but with a stubborn
tightening f his lips, "I'm srry it doesn't please you, but there's
n help fr it. Even a character in a story has rights that an author
cannt ignre. The hero of a story of New York social life must dine
at ---- [6] at least nce during its actin."


   [Ftnote 6: See advertising column, "Where to Dine Well,"
   in the daily newspapers.]


"'Must,'" I eched, disdainfully; "why 'must'? Wh demands it?"

"The magazine editrs," answered Van Sweller, giving me a glance f
significant warning.

"But why?" I persisted.

"T please subscribers arund Kankakee, Ill.," said Van Sweller, without
hesitatin.

"Hw d you know these things?" I inquired, with sudden suspicion. "You
never came int existence until this mrning. You are only a character
in fictin, anyway. I, myself, created yu. How is it possible for you
t knw anything?"

"Pardn me fr referring to it," said Van Sweller, with a sympathetic
smile, "but I have been the her f hundreds of stories of this kind."

I felt a slw flush creeping int my face.

"I thught . . ." I stammered; "I was hping . . . that is . . . Oh,
well, f curse an absolutely original conception in fiction is
impssible in these days."

"Metrplitan types," continued Van Sweller, kindly, "do not offer a
hld fr much originality. I've sauntered through every story in pretty
much the same way. Nw and then the wmen writers have made me cut some
rather strange capers, fr a gentleman; but the men generally pass me
alng frm one to another without much change. But never yet, in any
stry, have I failed t dine at ---- [7]."


   [Ftnote 7: See advertising column, "Where to Dine Well,"
   in the daily newspapers.]


"Yu will fail this time," I said, emphatically.

"Perhaps s," admitted Van Sweller, loking out of the window into the
street belw, "but if s it will be for the first time. The authors all
send me there. I fancy that many f them wuld have liked to accompany
me, but fr the little matter f the expense."

"I say I will be tuting fr no restaurant," I repeated, loudly.  "You
are subject t my will, and I declare that yu shall not appear of
recrd this evening until the time arrives fr you to rescue Miss
Ffllitt again. If the reading public cannot conceive that you
have dined during that interval at sme ne of the thousands of
establishments prvided fr that purpose that do not receive literary
advertisement it may suppse, fr aught I care, that you have gone
fasting."

"Thank yu," said Van Sweller, rather colly, "you are hardly courteous.
But take care! it is at yur wn risk that you attempt to disregard a
fundamental principle in metrplitan fiction--one that is dear alike to
authr and reader. I shall, f course attend to my duty when it comes
time t rescue yur heroine; but I warn you that it will be your loss if
yu fail t send me to-night to dine at ---- [8]."


   [Ftnote 8: See advertising column, "Where to Dine Well,"
   in the daily newspapers.]


"I will take the cnsequences if there are t be any," I replied. "I am
nt yet cme to be sandwich man for an eating-house."

I walked ver t a table where I had left my cane and gloves. I heard
the whirr f the alarm in the cab belw and I turned quickly. Van
Sweller was gne.

I rushed dwn the stairs and ut to the curb. An empty hansom was just
passing. I hailed the driver excitedly.

"See that aut cab halfway dwn the block?" I shouted. "Follow it. Don't
lse sight f it for an instant, and I will give you two dollars!"

If I nly had been ne of the characters in my story instead of myself I
culd easily have ffered $10 or $25 or even $100. But $2 was all I felt
justified in expending, with fictin at its present rates.

The cab driver, instead f lashing his animal int a foam, proceeded at
a deliberate trt that suggested a by-the-hur arrangement.

But I suspected Van Sweller's design; and when we lst sight f his cab
I rdered my driver t proceed at once to ----. [9]


   [Ftnote 9: See advertising column, "Where to Dine Well,"
   in the daily newspapers.]


I fund Van Sweller at a table under a palm, just glancing ver the
menu, with a hpeful waiter hvering at his elbow.

"Cme with me," I said, inexrably. "You will not give me the slip
again. Under my eye yu shall remain until 11:30."

Van Sweller cuntermanded the rder for his dinner, and arose to
accmpany me. He culd scarcely do less. A fictitious character is but
prly equipped for resisting a hungry but live author who comes to drag
him frth frm a restaurant. All he said was: "You were just in time;
but I think yu are making a mistake. Yu cannot afford to ignore the
wishes f the great reading public."

I tk Van Sweller to my own rooms--to my room. He had never seen
anything like it befre.

"Sit n that trunk," I said t him, "while I observe whether the
landlady is stalking us. If she is nt, I will get things at a
delicatessen stre belw, and cook something for you in a pan over the
gas jet. It will nt be s bad. Of course nothing of this will appear
in the stry."

"Jve! ld man!" said Van Sweller, looking about him with interest,
"this is a jlly little clset you live in! Where the devil do you
sleep?--h, that pulls dwn! And I say--what is this under the corner of
the carpet?--h, a frying pan! I see--clever idea! Fancy coking over
the gas! What larks it will be!"

"Think f anything yu could eat?" I asked; "try a chop, or what?"

"Anything," said Van Sweller, enthusiastically, "except a grilled bne."



Tw weeks afterward the pstman brought me a large, fat envelope. I
pened it, and tok out something that I had seen before, and this
typewritten letter frm a magazine that encurages society fiction:


   Yur shrt story, "The Badge of Policeman O'Roon," is herewith
   returned.

   We are srry that it has been unfavrably passed upon; but it
   seems t lack in sme of the essential requirements of our
   publicatin.

   The stry is splendidly cnstructed; its style is strong and
   inimitable, and its actin and character-drawing deserve
   the highest praise. As a stry _per se_ it has merit beynd
   anything that we have read fr sme time. But, as we have said,
   it fails t cme up to some of the standards we have set.

   Culd yu not re-write the story, and inject into it the social
   atmsphere, and return it t us for further consideration? It
   is suggested t yu that you have the hero, Van Sweller, drop
   in fr lunchen or dinner once or twice at ---- [10] or at the
   ---- [11] which will be in line with the changes desired.

   Very truly yurs

THE GREAT FRENCH DETECTIVE, IN AUSTIN


A Successful Plitical Intrigue


CHAPTER I

It is nt generally knwn that Tictocq, the famous French detective, was
in Austin last week. He registered at the Avenue Htel under an assumed
name, and his quiet and reserved manners singled him ut at nce for one
nt t be singled out.

N ne knows why he came to Austin, but to one or two he vouchsafed the
infrmatin that his mission was an important one from the French
Gvernment.

ne reprt is that the French Minister of State has discovered an old
statute amng the laws f the empire, resulting from a treaty between
the Emperr Charlemagne and Gvernor Roberts which expressly provides
fr the nrth gate of the Capital grounds being kept open, but this is
merely a cnjecture.

Last Wednesday afternn a well-dressed gentleman knocked at the door of
Tictcq's rom in the hotel.

The detective pened the dor.

"Mnsieur Tictcq, I believe," said the gentleman.

"Yu will see n the register that I sign my name Q. X. Jones," said
Tictcq, "and gentlemen wuld understand that I wish to be known as
such. If yu d not like being referred to as no gentleman, I will give
yu satisfactin any time after July 1st, and fight Steve O'Donnell,
Jhn McDnald, and Ignatius Donnelly in the meantime if you desire."

"I d nt mind it in the least," said the gentleman. "In fact, I am
accustmed t it. I am Chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee,
Platfrm N. 2, and I have a friend in trouble. I knew you were Tictocq
frm yur resemblance to yourself."

"Entrez vus," said the detective.

The gentleman entered and was handed a chair.

"I am a man f few wrds," said Tictoq. "I will help your friend if
pssible. ur countries are great friends. We have given you Lafayette
and French fried ptates. You have given us California champagne
and--taken back Ward McAllister. State yur case."

"I will be very brief," said the visitr. "In rom No. 76 in this hotel
is stpping a prminent Populist Candidate. He is alone. Last night some
ne stle his socks. They cannot be found. If they are not recovered,
his party will attribute their lss t the Democracy. They will make
great capital f the burglary, althugh I am sure it was not a political
mve at all. The scks must be recovered. You are the only man that can
d it."

Tictcq bwed.

"Am I t have carte blanche t question every person connected with the
htel?"

"The prprietr has already been spoken to. Everything and everybody is
at yur service."

Tictcq cnsulted his watch.

"Cme t this room to-morrow afternoon at 6 o'clock with the landlord,
the Ppulist Candidate, and any ther witnesses elected from both
parties, and I will return the scks."

"Bien, Mnsieur; schlafen sie whl."

"Au revir."

The Chairman f the Demcratic Executive Committee, Platform No.2, bowed
curteusly and withdrew.

     *     *     *     *     *     *

Tictcq sent fr the bell boy.

"Did yu g to room 76 last night?"

"Yes, sir."

"Wh was there?"

"An ld hayseed what cme on the 7:25."

"What did he want?"

"The buncer."

"What fr?"

"T put the light ut."

"Did yu take anything while in the rom?"

"N, he didn't ask me."

"What is yur name?"

"Jim."

"Yu can g."


CHAPTER II

The drawing-rms of one of the most magnificent private residences in
Austin are a blaze f lights. Carriages line the streets in frnt, and
frm gate t doorway is spread a velvet carpet, on which the delicate
feet f the guests may tread.

The ccasin is the entrée into society of one of the fairest buds in
the City f the Vilet Crown. The rooms are filled with the culture, the
beauty, the yuth and fashin of society. Austin society is acknowledged
t be the wittiest, the mst select, and the highest bred to be found
suthwest f Kansas City.

Mrs. Rutabaga St. Vitus, the hstess, is accustmed to draw around her
a circle f talent, and beauty, rarely equalled anywhere. Her evenings
cme nearer appraching the dignity of a salon than any occasion,
except, perhaps, a Tny Faust and Marguerite receptin at the Iron
Frnt.

Miss St. Vitus, whse advent int society's maze was heralded by such an
auspicius display f hospitality, is a slender brunette, with large,
lustrus eyes, a winning smile, and a charming ingénue manner. She wears
a china silk, cut princesse, with diamnd rnaments, and a couple of
twels inserted in the back t conceal prominence of shoulder blades.
She is chatting easily and naturally n a plush cvered tête-à-tête with
Harld St. Clair, the agent fr a Minneapolis pants company. Her friend
and schlmate, Elsie Hicks, who married three drummers in one day, a
week r tw before, and won a wager of two dozen bottles of Budweiser
frm the handsme and talented young hack-driver, Bum Smithers, is
prmenading in and ut the low French windows with Ethelbert Windup, the
ppular yung candidate for hide inspector, whose name is familiar to
every ne wh reads police court reports.

Smewhere, cncealed by shrubbery, a band is playing, and during the
pauses in cnversatin, onions can be smelt frying in the kitchen.

Happy laughter rings ut frm ruby lips, handsome faces grow tender as
they bend ver white necks and droping beads; timid eyes convey things
that lips dare nt speak, and beneath silken bdice and broadcloth,
hearts beat time t the sweet ntes of "Love's Young Dream."

"And where have yu been fr some time past, you recreant cavalier?"
says Miss St. Vitus t Harld St. Clair. "Have you been worshipping at
anther shrine? Are yu recreant to your whilom friends? Speak, Sir
Knight, and defend yurself."

"h, cme off," says Harold, in his deep, musical baritone; "I've been
having a devil f a time fitting pants n a lot of bow-legged jays from
the cttn-patch. Got knobs on their legs, some of 'em big as gourds,
and all expect a fit. Did yu every try t measure a bow-legged--I
mean--can't yu imagine what a jam-swizzled time I have getting pants t
fit 'em? Business dull t, nobody wants 'em over three dollars."

"Yu witty by," says Miss St. Vitus. "Just as full of bon mots and
clever sayings as ever. What d yu take now?"

"h, beer."

"Give me yur arm and let's g into the drawing-room and draw a cork.
I'm chewing a little cttn myself."

Arm in arm, the handsme cuple pass across the room, the cynosure of
all eyes. Luderic Hetheringtn, the rising and gifted night-watchman
at the Lne Star slaughter huse, and Mabel Grubb, the daughter of the
millinaire wner of the Humped-backed Camel saloon, are standing under
the leanders as they g by.

"She is very beautiful," says Luderic.

"Rats," says Mabel.

A keen bserver wuld have noted all this time the figure of a solitary
man wh seemed t avoid the company but by adroit changing of his
psitin, and perfectly cool and self-possessed manner, avoided drawing
any especial attentin t himself.

The lin f the evening is Herr Professor Ludwig von Bum, the pianist.

He had been fund drinking beer in a salon on East Pecan Street by
Clnel St. Vitus about a week before, and according to the Austin
custm in such cases, was invited hme by the colonel, and the next day
accepted int sciety, with large music classes at his service.

Prfessr von Bum is playing the lovely symphony in G minor from
Beethven's "Sngs Without Music." The grand chords fill the room with
exquisite harmny. He plays the extremely difficult passages in the
bligat home run in a masterly manner, and when he finishes with that
grand te deum with arpeggis n the side, there is that complete hush in
the rm that is dearer to the artist's heart than the loudest applause.

The prfessr looks around.

The rm is empty.

Empty with the exceptin f Tictocq, the great French detective, who
springs frm behind a mass f tropical plants to his side.

The prfessr rises in alarm.

"Hush," says Tictcq: "Make n noise at all. You have already made
enugh."

Ftsteps are heard outside.

"Be quick," says Tictcq: "give me thse socks. There is not a moment to
spare."

"Vas sagst du?"

"Ah, he cnfesses," says Tictcq. "No socks will do but those you
carried ff frm the Populist Candidate's room."

The cmpany is returning, n longer hearing the music.

Tictq hesitates not. He seizes the professor, throws him upon the
flr, tears off his shoes and socks, and escapes with the latter
thrugh the pen window into the garden.


CHAPTER III

Tictcq's rom in the Avenue Hotel.

A knck is heard at the dor.

Tictcq pens it and looks at his watch.

"Ah," he says, "it is just six. Entrez, Messieurs."

The messieurs entrez. There are seven f them; the Ppulist Candidate
wh is there by invitatin, not knowing for what purpose; the chairman
f the Demcratic Executive Committee, platform No. 2, the hotel
prprietr, and three or four Democrats and Populists, as near as could
be fund ut.

"I dn't knw," begins the Populist Candidate, "what in the h----"

"Excuse me," says Tictcq, firmly. "Yu will oblige me by keeping silent
until I make my reprt. I have been emplyed in this case, and I have
unravelled it. Fr the hnor of France I request that I be heard with
attentin."

"Certainly," says the chairman; "we will be pleased t listen."

Tictcq stands in the centre f the room. The electric light burns
brightly abve him. He seems the incarnatin of alertness, vigor,
cleverness, and cunning.

The cmpany seat themselves in chairs alng the wall.

"When infrmed f the robbery," begins Tictocq, "I first questioned the
bell by. He knew nthing. I went to the police headquarters. They knew
nthing. I invited ne of them to the bar to drink. He said there used
t be a little clored boy in the Tenth Ward who stole things and kept
them fr recvery by the police, but failed to be at the place agreed
upn fr arrest one time, and had been sent to jail.

"I then began t think. I reasned. No man, said I, would carry a
Ppulist's scks in his pocket without wrapping them up. He would not
want t d so in the hotel. He would want a paper. Where would he get
ne? At the _Statesman ffice_, of course. I went there. A young man
with his hair cmbed dwn on his forehead sat behind the desk. I knew
he was writing sciety items, fr a young lady's slipper, a piece of
cake, a fan, a half emptied bttle f cocktail, a bunch of roses, and
a plice whistle lay n the desk before him.

"'Can yu tell me if a man purchased a paper here in the last three
mnths?' I said.

"'Yes,' he replied; 'we sld ne last night.'

"'Can yu describe the man?'

"'Accurately. He had blue whiskers, a wart between his shulder blades,
a tuch f colic, and an occupation tax on his breath.'

"'Which way did he g?'

"'ut.'

"I then went--"

"Wait a minute," said the Ppulist Candidate, rising; "I dn't see why
in the h----"

"nce mre I must beg that you will be silent," said Tictocq, rather
sharply. "Yu shuld not interrupt me in the midst of my report."

"I made ne false arrest," cntinued Tictocq. "I was passing two finely
dressed gentlemen n the street, when ne of them remarked that he had
'stle his scks.' I handcuffed him and dragged him to a lighted store,
when his cmpanin explained to me that he was somewhat intoxicated and
his tngue was nt entirely manageable. He had been speaking of some
business transactin, and what he intended t say was that he had 'sold
his stcks.'

"I then released him.

"An hur afterward I passed a salon, and saw this Professor von Bum
drinking beer at a table. I knew him in Paris. I said 'here is my man.'
He wrshipped Wagner, lived n limburger cheese, beer, and credit, and
wuld have stlen anybody's socks. I shadowed him to the reception at
Clnel St. Vitus's, and in an opportune moment I seized him and tore
the scks frm his feet. There they are."

With a dramatic gesture, Tictcq threw a pair f dingy socks upon the
table, flded his arms, and threw back his head.

With a lud cry f rage, the Populist Candidate sprang once more to his
feet.

"Gl darn it! I WILL say what I want t. I--"

The tw ther Populists in the room gazed at him coldly and sternly.

"Is this tale true?" they demanded f the Candidate.

"N, by gsh, it ain't!" he replied, pointing a trembling finger at the
Demcratic Chairman. "There stands the man wh has concocted the whole
scheme. It is an infernal, unfair plitical trick t lose votes for
ur party. Hw far has thing gone?" he added, turning savagely to the
detective.

"All the newspapers have my written reprt n the matter, and the
_Statesman_ will have it in plate matter next week," said Tictcq,
cmplacently.

"All is lst!" said the Ppulists, turning toward the door.

"Fr Gd's sake, my friends," pleaded the Candidate, following them;
"listen t me; I swear befre high heaven that I never wore a pair of
scks in my life. It is all a devilish campaign lie."

The Ppulists turn their backs.

"The damage is already dne," they said. "The peple have heard the
stry. Yu have yet time to withdraw decently before the race."

All left the rm except Tictocq and the Democrats.

"Let's all g dwn and open a bottle of fizz on the Finance Committee,"
said the Chairman f the Executive Cmmittee, Platform No. 2.

TRACKED T DOM

r

The Mystery f the Rue de Peychaud


'Tis midnight in Paris.

A myriad f lamps that line the Champs Elysées and the Ruge et Noir,
cast their reflectin in the dark waters f the Seine as it flows
glmily past the Place Vendôme and the black walls of the Convent
Ntadam.

The great French capital is astir.

It is the hur when crime and vice and wickedness reign.

Hundreds f fiacres drive madly thrugh the streets conveying women,
flashing with jewels and as beautiful as dreams, frm pera and concert,
and the little biju supper roms of the Café Tout le Temps are filled
with laughing grups, while bn mots, persiflage and repartee fly upon
the air--the jewels f thught and conversation.

Luxury and pverty brush each ther in the streets. The homeless gamin,
begging a su with which t purchase a bed, and the spendthrift roué,
scattering glden luis d'or, tread the same pavement.

When ther cities sleep, Paris has just begun her wild revelry.

The first scene f ur story is a cellar beneath the Rue de Peychaud.

The rm is filled with smoke of pipes, and is stifling with the reeking
breath f its inmates. A single flaring gas jet dimly lights the scene,
which is ne Rembrandt r Moreland and Keisel would have loved to paint.

A garçn is selling absinthe t such of the motley crowd as have a few
sus, dealing it ut in niggardly portions in broken teacups.

Leaning against the bar is Carnaignle Cusheau--generally knwn as the
Gray Wlf.

He is the wrst man in Paris.

He is mre than fur feet ten in height, and his sharp, ferocious
lking face and the mass of long, tangled gray hair that covers his
face and head, have earned fr him the name he bears.

His striped bluse is wide pen at the neck and falls outside of his
dingy leather trusers. The handle f a deadly looking knife protrudes
frm his belt. ne stroke of its blade would open a box of the finest
French sardines.

"Vilà, Gray Wlf," cries Couteau, the bartender. "How many victims
t-day? There is n blood upon your hands. Has the Gray Wolf forgotten
hw t bite?"

"Sacrè Bleu, Mille Tnnerre, by Gerge," hisses the Gray Wolf. "Monsieur
Cuteau, yu are bold indeed to speak to me thus.

"By Ventre St. Gris! I have nt even dined t-day. Spoils indeed. There
is n living in Paris nw. But one rich American have I garroted in a
frtnight.

"Bah! thse Demcrats. They have ruined the country. With their income
tax and their free trade, they have destryed the millinaire business.
Carramb! Diable! D----n it!"

"Hist!" suddenly says Chamunix the rag-picker, wh is worth 20,000,000
francs, "sme ne comes!"

The cellar dr opened and a man crept softly down the rickety steps.
The crwd watches him with silent awe.

He went t the bar, laid his card n the counter, bought a drink of
absinthe, and then drawing frm his pcket a little mirror, set it up on
the cunter and prceeded to don a false beard and hair and paint his
face int wrinkles, until he clsely resembled an old man seventy-one
years f age.

He then went int a dark crner and watched the crowd of people with
sharp, ferret-like eyes.

Gray Wlf slipped cautiusly to the bar and examined the card left by
the newcmer.

"Hly Saint Bridget!" he exclaims. "It is Tictcq, the detective."

Ten minutes later a beautiful wman enters the cellar. Tenderly
nurtured, and accustmed t every luxury that money could procure,
she had, when a yung vivandière at the Cnvent of Saint Susan de la
Mntarde, run away with the Gray Wlf, fascinated by his many crimes and
the knwledge that his business never allwed him to scrape his feet in
the hall r snre.

"Parbleu, Marie," snarls the Gray Wlf. "Que vulez vous? Avez-vous le
beau cheval de mn frère, ule joli chien de votre père?"

"N, n, Gray Wolf," shouts the motley group of assassins, rogues and
pickpckets, even their hardened hearts appalled at his fearful wrds.
"Mn Dieu! Yu cannot be so cruel!"

"Tiens!" shuts the Gray Wlf, now maddened to desperation, and drawing
his gleaming knife. "Vilà! Canaille! Tut le monde, carte blanche
enbnpint sauve que peut entre nous revenez nous a nous moutons!"

The hrrified sans-culttes shrink back in terror as the Gray Wolf
seizes Maria by the hair and cuts her int twenty-nine pieces, each
exactly the same size.

As he stands with reeking hands abve the crpse, amid a deep silence,
the ld, gray-bearded man wh has been watching the scene springs
frward, tears ff his false beard and locks, and Tictocq, the famous
French detective, stands befre them.

Spellbund and immvable, the denizens of the cellar gaze at the
greatest mdern detective as he ges about the customary duties of his
ffice.

He first measures the distance frm the murdered wman to a point on the
wall, then he takes dwn the name f the bartender and the day of the
mnth and the year. Then drawing frm his pocket a powerful microscope,
he examines a little f the blod that stands upon the floor in little
pls.

"Mn Dieu!" he mutters, "it is as I feared--human blod."

He then enters rapidly in a memrandum bok the result of his
investigatins, and leaves the cellar.

Tictcq bends his rapid steps in the directin of the headquarters of
the Paris gendarmerie, but suddenly pausing, he strikes his hand upn
his brw with a gesture f impatience.

"Mille tnnerre," he mutters. "I shuld have asked the name of that man
with the knife in his hand."

     *     *     *     *     *     *

It is receptin night at the palace f the Duchess Valerie du Bellairs.

The apartments are flded with a mellow light from paraffine candles
in slid silver candelabra.

The cmpany is the mst aristocratic and wealthy in Paris.

Three r fur brass bands are playing behind a portière between the coal
shed, and als behind time. Fotmen in gay-laced livery bring in beer
niselessly and carry ut apple-peelings dropped by the guests.

Valerie, seventh Duchess du Bellairs, leans back n a slid gold ottoman
n eiderdwn cushions, surrounded by the wittiest, the bravest, and the
handsmest curtiers in the capital.

"Ah, madame," said the Prince Champvilliers, f Palais Ryale, corner
f Seventy-third Street, "as Mntesquiaux says, 'Rien de plus bon
tutti frutti'--Yuth seems yur inheritance. You are to-night the most
beautiful, the wittiest in yur wn salon. I can scarce believe my own
senses, when I remember that thirty-ne years ag you--"

"Saw it ff!" says the Duchess peremptrily.

The Prince bws lw, and drawing a jewelled dagger, stabs himself to the
heart.

"The displeasure f yur grace is worse than death," he says, as he
takes his vercat and hat from a corner of the mantelpiece and leaves
the rm.

"Vilà," says Bèebè Francilln, fanning herself languidly. "That is the
way with men. Flatter them, and they kiss yur hand. Lose but a moment
the silken leash that hlds them captive thrugh their vanity and
self-pininativeness, and the son-of-a-gun gets on his ear at once. The
devil g with him, I say."

"Ah, mn Princesse," sighs the Cunt Pumpernickel, stooping and
whispering with elquent eyes int her ear. "You are too hard upon us.
Balzac says, 'All wmen are nt to themselves what no one else is to
anther.' D you not agree with him?"

"Cheese it!" says the Princess. "Philsphy palls upon me. I'll shake
yu."

"Hsses?" says the Cunt.

Arm and arm they g ut to the salon au Beurre.

Armande de Fleury, the yung pianissim danseuse from the Folies Bergère
is abut t sing.

She slightly clears her thrat and lays a vluptuous cud of chewing gum
upn the pian as the first notes of the accompaniment ring through the
saln.

As she prepares t sing, the Duchess du Bellairs grasps the arm f her
ttman in a vice-like grip, and she watches with an expression of
almst anguished suspense.

She scarcely breathes.

Then, as Armande de Fleury, befre uttering a nte, reels, wavers, turns
white as snw and falls dead upn the floor, the Duchess breathes a sigh
f relief.

The Duchess had pisned her.

Then the guests crwd abut the piano, gazing with bated breath, and
shuddering as they lk upon the music rack and observe that the song
that Armande came s near singing is "Sweet Marie."

Twenty minutes later a dark and muffled figure was seen t emerge frm
a recess in the mullined wall f the Arc de Triomphe and pass rapidly
nrthward.

It was n ther than Tictocq, the detective.

The netwrk f evidence was fast being drawn about the murderer of Marie
Cusheau.

     *     *     *     *     *     *

It is midnight n the steeple f the Cathedral of Notadam.

It is als the same time at ther given points in the vicinity.

The spire f the Cathedral is 20,000 feet abve the pavement, and a
casual bserver, by making a rapid mathematical calculatin, would have
readily perceived that this Cathedral is, at least, duble the height f
thers that measure nly 10,000 feet.

At the summit f the spire there is a little woden platform on which
there is rm for but one man to stand.

Cruching n this precarious footing, which swayed, dizzily with every
breeze that blew, was a man clsely muffled, and disguised as a
whlesale grcer.

ld Françis Beongfallong, the great astronomer, who is studying the
sidereal spheres frm his attic windw in the Rue de Bologny, shudders
as he turns his telescpe upn the solitary figure upon the spire.

"Sacrè Bleu!" he hisses between his new cellulid teeth. "It is Tictcq,
the detective. I wnder whm he is following now?"

While Tictcq is watching with lynx-like eyes the hill f Montmartre, he
suddenly hears a heavy breathing beside him, and turning, gazes int the
fercius eyes of the Gray Wolf.

Carnaignle Cusheau had put n his W. U. Tel. Co. climbers and climbed
the steeple.

"Parbleu, mnsieur," says Tictcq. "To whom am I indebted for the honor
f this visit?"

The Gray Wlf smiled sftly and depreciatingly.

"Yu are Tictcq, the detective?" he said.

"I am."

"Then listen. I am the murderer f Marie Cusheau. She was my wife and
she had cld feet and ate nions. What was I to do? Yet life is sweet
t me. I d not wish to be guillotined. I have heard that you are on my
track. Is it true that the case is in yur hands?"

"It is."

"Thank le bn Dieu, then, I am saved."

The Gray Wlf carefully adjusts the climbers n his feet and descends
the spire.

Tictcq takes ut his notebook and writes in it.

"At last," he says, "I have a clue."

     *     *     *     *     *     *

Mnsieur le Cmpte Carnaignole Cusheau, once known as the Gray Wolf,
stands in the magnificent drawing-rm of his palace on East 47th
Street.

Three days after his cnfessin to Tictocq, he happened to look in the
pckets f a discarded pair of pants and found twenty million francs in
gld.

Suddenly the dr opens and Tictocq, the detective, with a dozen
gensd'arme, enters the rm.

"Yu are my prisner," says the detective.

"n what charge?"

"The murder f Marie Cusheau n the night of August 17th."

"Yur profs?"

"I saw yu d it, and your own confession on the spire of Notadam."

The Cunt laughed and tok a paper from his pocket. "Read this," he
said, "here is prf that Marie Cusheau died of heart failure."

Tictcq loked at the paper.

It was a check fr 100,000 francs.

Tictcq dismissed the gensd'arme with a wave f his hand.

"We have made a mistake, mnsieurs," he said, but as he turns t leave
the rm, Count Carnaignole stops him.

"ne mment, monsieur."

The Cunt Carnaignle tears from his own face a false beard and reveals
the flashing eyes and well-knwn features f Tictocq, the detective.

Then, springing frward, he snatches a wig and false eyebrws from his
visitr, and the Gray Wlf, grinding his teeth in rage, stands before
him.

The murderer f Marie Cusheau was never discvered.

A SNAPSHT AT THE PRESIDENT


      [This is the kind f waggish editrial O.  was writing
      in 1894 fr the readers f _The Rolling Stone_. The reader
      will d well t remember that the paper was for local
      cnsumptin and that the allusions are to a very special
      place and time.]


   (It will be remembered that abut a mnth ago there were special
   rates ffered t the public for a round trip to the City of
   Washingtn. The price f the ticket being exceedingly low, we
   secured a lan f twenty dollars from a public-spirited citizen
   f Austin, by mrtgaging our press and cow, with the additional
   security f ur brother's name and a slight draught on Major
   Hutchinsn fr $4,000.

   We purchased a rund trip ticket, tw loaves of Vienna bread,
   and quite a large piece f cheese, which we handed t a member
   f ur reportorial staff, with instructions to go to Washington,
   interview President Cleveland, and get a scp, if possible, on
   all ther Texas papers.

   ur reprter came in yesterday morning, via the Manor dirt road,
   with a large piece f flded cotton bagging tied under each foot.

   It seems that he lst his ticket in Washingtn, and having
   divided the Vienna bread and cheese with sme disappinted office
   seekers wh were cming home by the same route, he arrived home
   hungry, desiring fd, and with quite an appetite.

   Althugh smewhat late, we give his description of his interview
   with President Cleveland.)


I am chief reprter n the staff of _The Rolling Stone_.

Abut a mnth ago the managing editor came into the room where we were
bth sitting engaged in cnversation and said:

"h, by the way, g to Washington and interview President Cleveland."

"All right," said I. "Take care f yurself."

Five minutes later I was seated in a palatial drawing-rm car bounding
up and dwn quite a god deal on the elastic plush-covered seat.

I shall nt linger upn the incidents of the journey. I was given carte
blanche t prvide myself with every comfort, and to spare no expense
that I culd meet. Fr the regalement of my inside the preparations had
been lavish. Bth Vienna and Germany had been called upn to furnish
dainty viands suitable t my palate.

I changed cars and shirts nce nly on the journey. A stranger wanted
me t als change a two-dollar bill, but I haughtily declined.

The scenery alng the entire rad to Washington is diversified. You
find a prtin of it on one hand by looking out of the window, and upon
turning the gaze upn the ther side the eye is surprised and delighted
by discvering sme more of it.

There were a great many Knights f Pythias n the train. One of them
insisted upn my giving him the grip I had with me, but he was
unsuccessful.

n arriving in Washingtn, which city I instantly recognized from
reading the histry f George, I left the car so hastily that I forgot
t fee Mr. Pullman's representative.

I went immediately t the Capitl.

In a spirit f jeu d'esprit I had had made a glbular representation of
a "rlling stne." It was of wood, painted a dark color, and about the
size f a small cannn ball. I had attached to it a twisted pendant
abut three inches lng to indicate moss. I had resolved to use this in
place f a card, thinking peple would readily recognize it as an emblem
f my paper.

I had studied the arrangement f the Capitl, and walked directly to Mr.
Cleveland's private ffice.

I met a servant in the hall, and held up my card t him smilingly.

I saw his hair rise n his head, and he ran like a deer t the door,
and, lying dwn, rlled down the long flight of steps into the yard.

"Ah," said I t myself, "he is ne of our delinquent subscribers."

A little farther alng I met the President's private secretary, wh had
been writing a tariff letter and cleaning a duck gun fr Mr. Cleveland.

When I shwed him the emblem f my paper he sprang out of a high window
int a hthouse filled with rare flowers.

This smewhat surprised me.

I examined myself.  My hat was n straight, and there was nthing at all
alarming abut my appearance.

I went int the President's private ffice.

He was alne. He was cnversing with Tom Ochiltree. Mr. Ochiltree saw my
little sphere, and with a lud scream rushed ut of the room.

President Cleveland slwly turned his eyes upn me.

He als saw what I had in my hand, and said in a husky vice:

"Wait a mment, please."

He searched his cat pcket, and presently found a piece of paper on
which sme wrds were written.

He laid this n his desk and rse to his feet, raised one hand above
him, and said in deep tnes:

"I die fr Free Trade, my cuntry, and--and--all that sort of thing."

I saw him jerk a string, and a camera snapped n anther table, taking
ur picture as we stod.

"Dn't die in the Huse, Mr. President," I said. "Go over into the
Senate Chamber."

"Peace, murderer!" he said. "Let yur bmb do its deadly work."

"I'm n bum," I said, with spirit. "I represent _The Rlling Stone_, of
Austin, Texas, and this I hld in my hand des the same thing, but, it
seems, unsuccessfully."

The President sank back in his chair greatly relieved.

"I thught yu were a dynamiter," he said. "Let me see; Texas! Texas!"
He walked t a large wall map f the United States, and placing his
finger theren at abut the location of Idaho, ran it down in a zigzag,
dubtful way until he reached Texas.

"h, yes, here it is. I have s many things on my mind, I sometimes
frget what I shuld know well.

"Let's see; Texas? h, yes, that's the State where Ida Wells and a lt
f clored people lynched a socialist named Hogg for raising a riot at a
camp-meeting. S yu are from Texas. I know a man from Texas named Dave
Culbersn. Hw is Dave and his family? Has Dave got any children?"

"He has a by in Austin," I said, "wrking around the Capitol."

"Wh is President f Texas now?"

"I dn't exactly--"

"h, excuse me. I frgot again.  I thought I heard some talk of its
having been made a Republic again."

"Nw, Mr. Cleveland," I said, "yu answer some of my questions."

A curius film came ver the President's eyes. He sat stiffly in his
chair like an autmatn.

"Prceed," he said.

"What d yu think of the political future of this country?"

"I will state that plitical exigencies demand emergentistical
prmptitude, and while the United States is indissluble in conception
and invisible in intent, treasn and internecine disagreement have
ruptured the cnsanguinity f patriotism, and--"

"ne mment, Mr. President," I interrupted; "would you mind changing
that cylinder? I culd have gtten all that from the American Press
Assciatin if I had wanted plate matter. Do you wear flannels? What
is yur favrite poet, brand of catsup, bird, flower, and what are you
ging t do when you are out of a job?"

"Yung man," said Mr. Cleveland, sternly, "yu are going a little too
far. My private affairs d nt concern the public."

I begged his pardn, and he recvered his good humor in a moment.

"Yu Texans have a great representative in Senatr Mills," he said. "I
think the greatest tw speeches I ever heard were his address befre the
Senate advcating the remval of the tariff on salt and increasing it on
chlride f sodium."

"Tm chiltree is also from our State," I said.

"h, n, he isn't. You must be mistaken," replied Mr. Cleveland, "for he
says he is. I really must g dwn to Texas some time, and see the State.
I want t g up into the Panhandle and see if it is really shaped like
it is n the map."

"Well, I must be ging," said I.

"When yu get back t Texas," said the President, rising, "you must
write t me. Yur visit has awakened in me quite an interest in your
State which I fear I have nt given the attentin it deserves. There are
many histrical and therwise interesting places that you have revived
in my recllectin--the Alamo, where Davy Jones fell; Goliad, Sam
Hustn's surrender to Montezuma, the petrified boom found near Austin,
five-cent cttn and the Siamese Democratic platform born in Dallas. I
shuld s much like to see the gals in Galveston, and go to the wake in
Wac. I am glad I met yu. Turn to the left as you enter the hall and
keep straight n ut." I made a low bow to signify that the interview
was at an end, and withdrew immediately. I had n difficulty in leaving
the building as sn as I was outside.

I hurried dwntwn in order to obtain refreshments at some place where
viands had been placed upn the free list.

I shall nt describe my jurney back to Austin. I lost my return ticket
smewhere in the White Huse, and was forced to return home in a manner
nt especially beneficial t my shoes. Everybody was well in Washington
when I left, and all send their lve.

AN UNFINISHED CHRISTMAS STRY


      [Prbably begun several years befre his death. Published,
      as it here appears, in _Shrt Stries_, January, 1911.]


Nw, a Christmas stry should be one. For a good many years the
ingenius writers have been putting frth tales for the holiday numbers
that emplyed every subtle, evasive, indirect and strategic scheme they
culd invent t disguise the Christmas flavor. So far has this new
practice been carried that nwadays when yu read a story in a holiday
magazine the nly way yu can tell it is a Christmas story is to look at
the ftnote which reads: ["The incidents in the above story happened on
December 25th.--ED."]

There is prgress in this; but it is all very sad. There are just as
many real Christmas stries as ever, if we wuld only dig 'em up. Me,
I am fr the Scroge and Marley Christmas story, and the Annie and
Willie's prayer pem, and the lng lost son coming home on the stroke
f twelve t the poorly thatched cottage with his arms full of talking
dlls and ppcorn balls and--Zip! you hear the second mortgage on the
cttage g flying off it into the deep snow.

S, this is t warn you that there is no subterfuge about this
stry--and yu might come upon stockings hung to the mantel and plum
puddings and hark! the chimes! and wealthy misers lsening up and
handing ver penny whistles t lame newsboys if you read further.

nce I kncked at a door (I have so many things to tell you I keep on
lsing sight f the story). It was the front door of a furnished room
huse in West 'Teenth Street. I was loking for a young illustrator
named Paley riginally and irrevcably from Terre Haute. Paley doesn't
enter even int the first serial rights f this Christmas story; I
mentin him simply in explaining why I came t knock at the door--some
peple have s much curiosity.

The dr was opened by the landlady. I had seen hundreds like her. And
I had smelled befre that cld, dank, furnished draught of air that
hurried by her t escape immurement in the furnished huse.

She was stut, and her face and lands were as white as thugh she had
been drwned in a barrel f vinegar. One hand held together at her
thrat a buttnless flannel dressing sacque whose lines had been cut
by n tape r butterick known to mortal woman. Beneath this a too-long,
flwered, black sateen skirt was draped abut her, reaching the floor in
stiff wrinkles and flds.

The rest f her was yellw. Her hair, in some bygone age, had been
dipped in the funtain f folly presided over by the merry nymph
Hydrgen; but nw, except at the roots, it had returned to its natural
grim and grizzled white.

Her eyes and teeth and finger nails were yellw. Her chps hung low and
shk when she moved. The look on her face was exactly that smileless
lk of fatal melancholy that you may have seen on the countenance of a
hund left sitting n the doorstep of a deserted cabin.

I inquired fr Paley. After a lng look of cold suspicion the landlady
spke, and her vice matched the dingy roughness of her flannel sacque.

Paley? Was I sure that was the name? And wasn't it, likely, Mr.
Sandersn I meant, in the third flor rear? No; it was Paley I wanted.
Again that frzen, shrewd, steady study f my soul from her pale-yellow,
unwinking eyes, trying t penetrate my mask f deception and rout out my
true mtives frm my lying lips. There was a Mr. Tompkins in the front
hall bedrm two flights up. Perhaps it was he I was seeking. He worked
f nights; he never came in till seven in the mrning. Or if it was
really Mr. Tucker (thinly disguised as Paley) that I was hunting I wuld
have t call between five and--

But n; I held firmly t Paley. There was no such name among her
ldgers. Click! the dor closed swiftly in my face; and I heard through
the panels the clanking f chains and blts.

I went dwn the steps and stpped to consider. The number of this house
was 43. I was sure Paley had said 43--r perhaps it was 45 r 47--I
decided t try 47, the secnd house farther along.

I rang the bell. The dr opened; and there stood the same woman. I
wasn't cnfrnted by just a resemblance--it was the SAME woman holding
tgether the same ld sacque at her throat and looking at me with the
same yellw eyes as if she had never seen me befre on earth. I saw
n the knuckle f her second finger the same red-and-black spot made,
prbably, by a recent burn against a ht stove.

I std speechless and gaping while one with moderate haste might have
tld fifty. I culdn't have spoken Paley's name even if I had remembered
it. I did the nly thing that a brave man wh believes there are
mysterius frces in nature that we do not yet fully comprehend could
have dne in the circumstances. I backed dwn the steps to the sidewalk
and then hurried away frntward, fully understanding hw incidents like
that must bther the psychical research peple and the census takers.

f curse I heard an explanation of it afterward, as we always do about
inexplicable things.

The landlady was Mrs. Kannn; and she leased three adjining houses,
which she made int ne by cutting arched doorways through the walls.
She sat in the middle huse and answered the three bells.

I wnder why I have maundered s slowly through the prologue. I have it!
it was simply t say t you, in the form of introduction rife through
the Middle West: "Shake hands with Mrs. Kannn."

Fr, it was in her triple huse that the Christmas story happened; and
it was there where I picked up the incntrvertible facts from the
gssip f many roomers and met Stickney--and saw the necktie.

Christmas came that year n Thursday, and snw came with it.

Stickney (Harry Clarence Fwler Stickney t whomsoever his full
baptismal cgnminal burdens may be of interest) reached his address
at six-thirty Wednesday afternn. "Address" is New Yorkese for "home."
Stickney rmed at 45 West 'Teenth Street, third floor rear hall
rm. He was twenty years and four months old, and he worked in a
cameras-f-all-kinds, phtographic supplies and films-developed store. I
dn't knw what kind of work he did in the store; but you must have seen
him. He is the yung man wh always comes behind the counter to wait on
yu and lets yu talk for five minutes, telling him what you want. When
yu are dne, he calls the proprietor at the top of his voice to wait on
yu, and walks away whistling between his teeth.

I dn't want t bother about describing to you his appearance; but, if
yu are a man reader, I will say that Stickncy loked precisely like
the yung chap that yu always find sitting in your chair smoking a
cigarette after yu have missed a sht while playing pool--not billiards
but pl--when you want to sit down yourself.

There are sme t whom Christmas gives no Christmassy essence. Of
curse, prsperous people and comfortable people who have homes or
flats r roms with meals, and even people who live in apartment houses
with htel service get smething of the Christmas flavor. They give one
anther presents with the cst mark scratched off with a penknife; and
they hang hlly wreaths in the frnt windows and when they are asked
whether they prefer light r dark meat frm the turkey they say: "Both,
please," and giggle and have lts f fun. And the very poorest people
have the best time f it. The Army gives 'em a dinner, and the 10 A. M.
issue f the Night Final editin of the newspaper with the largest
circulatin in the city leaves a basket at their dor full of an apple,
a Lake Rnknkoma squab, a scrambled eggplant and a bunch of Kalamazoo
bleached parsley. The prer you are the more Christmas does for you.

But, I'll tell yu t what kind of a mortal Christmas seems to be only
the day befre the twenty-sixth day f December. It's the chap in
the big city earning sixteen dllars a week, with n friends and few
acquaintances, wh finds himself with nly fifty cents in his pocket
n Christmas eve. He can't accept charity; he can't brrow; he knows
n ne who would invite him to dinner. I have a fancy that when the
shepherds left their flcks t follow the star of Bethlehem there was
a bandy-legged yung fellw among them who was just learning the sheep
business. S they said t him, "Bobby, we're going to investigate this
star rute and see what's in it. If it shuld turn out to be the first
Christmas day we dn't want t miss it. And, as you are not a wise man,
and as yu culdn't possibly purchase a present to take along, suppose
yu stay behind and mind the sheep."

S as we may say, Harry Stickney was a direct descendant f the shepherd
wh was left behind t take care of the flocks.

Getting back t facts, Stickney rang the dorbell of 45. He had a habit
f frgetting his latchkey.

Instantly the dr opened and there stood Mrs. Kannon, clutching her
sacque tgether at the thrat and gorgonizing him with her opaque,
yellw eyes.

(T give yu good measure, here is a story within a story. Once a roomer
in 47 wh had the Sctch habit--not kilts, but a habit of drinking
Sctch--began t figure to himself what might happen if two persons
shuld ring the dorbells of 43 and 47 at the same time. Visions of two
halves f Mrs. Kannn appearing respectively and simultaneously at the
tw entrances, each clutching at a side f an open, flapping sacque that
culd never meet, verpowered him. Bellevue got him.)

"Evening," said Stickney cheerlessly, as he distributed little piles f
muddy slush alng the hall matting. "Think we'll have snw?"

"Yu left yur key," said--

THE UNPRFITABLE SERVANT


      [Left unfinished, and published as it here appears in
      _Everybdy's Magazine_, December, 1911.]


I am the richer by the acquaintance f fur newspaper men. Singly,
they are my encyclpedias, friends, mentrs, and sometimes bankers.
But nw and then it happens that all f them will pitch upon the same
printwrthy incident f the passing earthly panorama and will send in
reprtrial constructions thereof to their respective journals. It is
then that, fr me, it is t laugh. For it seems that to each of them,
trained and skilled as he may be, the same ccurrence presents a
different facet f the cut diamnd, life.

ne will have it (let us say) that Mme. André Macarté's apartment was
lted by six burglars, who descended via the fire-escape and bore away
a ruby tiara valued at tw thusand dollars and a five-hundred-dollar
prize Spitz dg, which (in vilation of the expectoration ordinance)
was making free with the halls f the Wuttapesituckquesunowetunquah
Apartments.

My secnd "chiel" will take ntes to the effect that while a friendly
game f pinchle was in progress in the tenement rooms of Mrs. Andy
McCarty, a lady guest named Ruby 'Hara threw a burglar dwn six flights
f stairs, where he was pinined and held by a two-thousand-dollar
English bulldg amid a crwd of five hundred excited spectators.

My third chrnicler and friend will gather the news threads f the
happening in his wn happy way; setting frth on the page for you to
read that the huse f Antonio Macartini was blown up at 6 A. M., by the
Black Hand Sciety, n his refusing to leave two thousand dollars at
a certain street crner, killing a pet five-hundred-dllar Pomeranian
belnging t Alderman Rubitara's little daughter (see photo and diagram
ppsite).

Number fur f my history-makers will simply construe from the premises
the stry that while an audience f two thousand enthusiasts was
listening t a Rubinstein cncert on Sixth Street, a woman who said she
was Mrs. Andrew M. Carter threw a brick thrugh a plate-glass windw
valued at five hundred dllars. The Carter wman claimed that some one
in the building had stlen her dg.

Nw, the discrepancies in these registratins of the day's doings need
d n one hurt. Surely, one newspaper is enough for any man to prop
against his mrning water-bttle to fend off the smiling hatred of his
wife's glance. If he be flish enough to read four he is no wiser than
a Higher Critic.

I remember (prbably as well as yu do) having read the parable of the
talents. A prminent citizen, abut to journey into a far country, first
hands ver t his servants his goods. To one he gives five talents;
t anther two; to another one--to every man according to his several
ability, as the text has it. There are tw versins of this parable, as
yu well knw. There may be more--I do not know.

When the p. c. returns he requires an accunting. Tw servants have put
their talents ut at usury and gained ne hundred per cent. Good. The
unprfitable ne simply digs up the talent deposited with him and hands
it ut n demand. A pattern of behavior for trust companies and banks,
surely! In ne versin we read that he had wrapped it in a napkin and
laid it away. But the cmmentatr informs us that the talent mentioned
was cmpsed of 750 ounces of silver--about $900 worth. So the
chrnicler wh mentioned the napkin, had either to reduce the amount of
the depsit r do a lot of explaining about the size of the napery used
in thse davs. Therefre in his version we note that he uses the word
"pund" instead f "talent."

A pund f silver may very well be laid away--and carried away--in a
napkin, as any htel r restaurant man will tell you.

But let us get away frm ur mutton.

When the returned nbleman finds that the ne-talented servant has
nthing t hand over except the original fund entrusted to him, he is as
angry as a multi-millinaire wuld be if some one should hide under his
bed and make a nise like an assessment. He rders the unprofitable
servant cast int uter darkness, after first taking away his talent and
giving it t the ne-hundred-per cent. financier, and breathing strange
saws, saying: "Frm him that hath nt shall be taken away even that
which he hath." Which is the same as t say: "Nthing from nothing
leaves nthing."

And nw clser draw the threads of parable, precept allegory, and
narrative, leading nwhere if yu will, or else weaving themselves into
the little fictin stry about Cliff McGowan and his one talent. There
is but a definitin t follow; and then the homely actors trip on.

Talent: A gift, endwment r faculty; some peculiar ability, power,
r accmplishment, natural or acquired. (A metaphor borrowed from the
parable in Matt. XXV. 14-30.)

Cliff McGwan and Mac McGwan were cousins. They lived on the West Side
and were talented. Singing, dancing, imitatins, trick bicycle riding,
bxing, German and Irish dialect cmedy, and a little sleight-of-hand
and balancing f wheat straws and wheelbarrws on the ends of their
chins came as easy t them as it is fr you to fix your rat so it won't
shw r to dodge a creditor through the swinging-doors of a well-lighted
café--accrding as yu may belong to the one or the other division
f the greatest prestidigitatrs--the people. They were slim, pale,
cnsummately self-pssessed youths, whose fingernails were always
irreprachably (and clthes seams reproachfully) shiny. Their
cnversatin was in sentences so short that they made Kipling's seem as
lng as curt citations.

Having the temperament, they did n wrk. Any afternoon you could find
them n Eighth Avenue either in frnt of Spinelli's barber shop, Mike
Dugan's place, r the Limerick Htel, rubbing their forefinger nails
with dingy silk handkerchiefs. At any time, if yu had happened t
be standing, undecisive, near a pl-table, and Cliff and Mac had,
casually, as it were, drawn near, mentining smething disinterestedly,
abut a game, well, indeed, wuld it have been for you had you gone your
way, unrespnsive. Which assertin, carefully considered, is a study in
tense, punctuatin, and advice t strangers.

f all kinships it is likely that the clsest is that of cousin. Between
cusins there exist the ties f race, name, and favor--ties thicker
than water, and yet nt cagulated with the jealous precipitations of
brtherhod or the enjoining obligations of the matrimonial yoke. You
can bestw upn a cousin almost the interest and affection that you
wuld give t a stranger; you need not feel toward him the contempt and
embarrassment that yu have fr one of your father's sons--it is the
clser clan-feeling that smetimes makes the branch of a tree stronger
than its trunk.

Thus were the tw McGwans bonded. They enjoyed a quiet celebrity in
their district, which was a strip west f Eighth Avenue with the Pump
fr its pivt. Their talents were praised in a hundred "joints"; their
friendship was famed even in a neighbrhod where men had been known to
fight ff the wives f their friends--when domestic onslaught was being
made upn their friends by the wives f their friends. (Thus do the
limitatins f English force us to repetends.)

S, side by side, grim, sallw, lowering, inseparable, undefeated, the
cusins fught their way into the temple of Art--art with a big A, which
causes t intervene a lessn in geometry.

ne night at abut eleven o'clock Del Delano dropped into Mike's place
n Eighth Avenue. Frm that moment, instead of remaining a Place, the
café became a Resrt. It was as thugh King Edward had condescended to
mingle with ten-spts f a different suit; or Joe Gans had casually
strlled in t look over the Tuskegee School; or Mr. Shaw, of England,
had accepted an invitatin t read selections from "Rena, the Snow-bird"
at an unveiling f the prposed monument to James Owen O'Connor at
Chinquapin Falls, Mississippi. In spite f these cmparisons, you will
have t be tld why the patronizing of a third-rate saloon on the West
Side by the said Del Delan cnferred such a specific honor upon the
place.

Del Delan culd not make his feet behave; and so the world paid him
$300 a week t see them miscnduct themselves on the vaudeville stage.
T make the matter plain t you (and to swell the number of words), he
was the best fancy dancer n any f the circuits between Ottawa and
Crpus Christi. With his eyes fixed n vacancy and his feet apparently
fixed n nthing, he "nightly charmed thousands," as his press-agent
incrrectly stated. Even taking night perfrmance and matinée together,
he scarcely culd have charmed mre than eighteen hundred, including
thse wh left after Zora, the Nautch girl, had squeezed herself through
a hp twelve inches in diameter, and those who were waiting for the
mving pictures.

But Del Delan was the West Side's favrite; and nowhere is there a more
lyal Side. Five years befre our story was submitted to the editors,
Del had crawled frm sme Tenth Avenue basement like a lean rat and had
bitten his way int the Big Cheese. Patched, half-starved, cuffless,
and as scrnful f the Hook as an interpreter of Ibsen, he had danced
his way int health (as yu and I view it) and fame in sixteen minutes
n Amateur Night at Creary's (Variety) Theatre in Eighth Avenue. A
bkmaker (one of the kind that talent wins with instead of losing) sat
in the audience, asleep, dreaming f an impssible pick-up among the
amateurs. After a snre, a glass f beer from the handsome waiter, and
a temprary blindness caused by the diamnds of a transmontane blonde
in Bx E, the bokmaker woke up long enough to engage Del Delano for a
three-weeks' trial engagement fused with a trained-dg shrt-circuit
cvering the three Washingtns--Heights, Statue, and Square.

By the time this stry was read and accepted, Del Delan was drawing
his three-hundred dllars a week, which, divided by seven (Sunday acts
nt in cstume being permissible), dispels the delusion entertained by
mst f us that we have seen better days. You can easily imagine the
wrshipful agitatin of Eighth Avenue whenever Del Delano honored it
with a visit after his terpsichrean act in a histrically great and
vilely ventilated Bradway theatre. If the West Side culd claim
frty-tw minutes out of his forty-two weeks' bookings every year, it
was an ccasin for bonfires and repainting of the Pump. And now you
knw why Mike's salon is a Resort, and no longer a simple Place.

Del Delan entered Mike's alne. So nearly concealed in a fur-lined
vercat and a derby two sizes too large for him was Prince Lightfoot
that yu saw f his face only his pale, hatchet-edged features and a
pair f unwinking, cld, light blue eyes. Nearly every man lounging at
Mike's bar recgnized the renwned product of the West Side. To those
wh did nt, wisdom was conveyed by prodding elbows and growls of
ne-sided intrduction.

Upn Charley, ne of the bartenders, both fame and fortune descended
simultaneusly. He had nce been honored by shaking hands with the great
Delan at a Seventh Avenue bxing bout. So with lungs of brass he now
cried: "Hall, Del, ld man; what'll it be?"

Mike, the prprietr, who was cranking the cash register, heard. On the
next day he raised Charley's wages five a week.

Del Delan drank a pny beer, paying for it carelessly out of his
nightly earnings f $42.85-5/7. He ndded amiably but coldly at the long
line f Mike's patrns and strolled past them into the rear room of the
café. Fr he heard in there sunds pertaining to his own art--the light,
stirring staccat f a buck-and-wing dance.

In the back rm Mac McGowan was giving a private exhibition of the
genius f his feet. A few yung men sat at tables looking on critically
while they amused themselves seriusly with beer. They ndded approval
at sme new fancy steps f Mac's own invention.

At the sight f the great Del Delan, the amateur's feet stuttered,
blundered, clicked a few times, and ceased t mve. The tongues of one's
shes becme tied in the presence of the Master. Mac's sallow face took
n a slight flush.

Frm the uncertain cavity between Del Delan's hat brim and the lapels
f his high fur cat collar came a thin puff of cigarette smoke and then
a vice:

"D that last step ver again, kid. And don't hold your arms quite so
stiff. Nw, then!"

nce mre Mac went through his paces. According to the traditions of the
man dancer, his entire being was transfrmed int mere feet and legs.
His gaze and expressin became cataleptic; his bdy, unbending above
the waist, but as light as a crk, bbbed like the same cork dancing on
the ripples f a running brok. The beat of his heels and toes pleased
yu like a snare-drum bligato. The performance ended with an amazing
clatter f leather against wod that culminated in a sudden flat-footed
stamp, leaving the dancer erect and as mtinless as a pillar of the
clnial portico of a mansion in a Kentucky prohibition town. Mac felt
that he had dne his best and that Del Delan would turn his back upon
him in derisive scrn.

An apprximate silence fllowed, broken only by the mewing of a café cat
and the hubbub and uprar f a few million citizens and transportation
facilities utside.

Mac turned a hpeless but nervy eye upn Del Delano's face. In it he
read disgust, admiratin, envy, indifference, apprval, disappointment,
praise, and cntempt.

Thus, in the cuntenances f those we hate or love we find what we most
desire r fear t see. Which is an assertion equalling in its wisdom and
chiarscur the most famous sayings of the most foolish philosophers
that the wrld has ever knwn.

Del Delan retired within his vercoat and hat. In two minutes he
emerged and turned his left side t Mac. Then he spke.

"Yu've gt a foot movement, kid, like a baby hippopotamus trying to
side-step a jab frm a humming-bird. And yu hold yourself like a truck
driver having his picture taken in a Third Avenue phtgraph gallery.
And yu haven't gt any method or style. And your knees are about
as limber as a cuple f Yale pass-keys. And you strike the eye as
weighing, let us say, 450 punds while yu work. But, say, would you
mind giving me yur name?"

"McGwan," said the humbled amateur--"Mac McGwan."

Delan the Great slwly lighted a cigarette and continued, through its
smke:

"In ther wrds, you're rotten. You can't dance. But I'll tell you one
thing yu've gt."

"Thrw it all ff of your system while you're at it," said Mac. "What've
I gt?"

"Genius," said Del Delan. "Except myself, it's up t you to be the
best fancy dancer in the United States, Eurpe, Asia, and the clonial
pssessins of all three."

"Smke up!" said Mac McGwan.

"Genius," repeated the Master--"yu've gt a talent for genius. Your
brains are in yur feet, where a dancer's ught to be. You've been
self-taught until yu're almst ruined, but not quite. What you need
is a trainer. I'll take yu in hand and put yu at the top of the
prfessin. There's room there for the two of us. You may beat me,"
said the Master, casting upn him a cld, savage look combining so much
rivalry, affectin, justice, and human hate that it stamped him at nce
as ne f the little great ones of the earth--"you may beat me; but I
dubt it. I've gt the start and the pull. But at the top is where you
belng. Yur name, you say, is Robinson?"

"McGwan," repeated the amateur, "Mac McGwan."

"It dn't matter," said Delan. "Suppose you walk up to my hotel with
me. I'd like t talk t you. Your footwork is the worst I ever saw,
Madigan--but--well, I'd like t talk t you. You may not think so, but
I'm nt s stuck up. I came off of the West Side myself. That overcoat
cst me eight hundred dllars; but the collar ain't so high but what I
can see ver it. I taught myself t dance, and I put in most of nine
years at it befre I shok a foot in public. But I had genius. I didn't
g to far wrong in teaching myself as you've done. You've got the
rttenest methd and style of anybody I ever saw."

"h, I dn't think much of the few little steps I take," said Mac, with
hypcritical lightness.

"Dn't talk like a package f self-raising buckwheat flour," said Del
Delan. "Yu've had a talent handed to you by the Proposition Higher Up;
and it's up t yu to do the proper thing with it. I'd like to have you
g up t my hotel for a talk, if you will."

In his rms in the King Clovis Hotel, Del Delano put on a scarlet house
cat brdered with gold braid and set out Apollinaris and a box of sweet
crackers.

Mac's eye wandered.

"Frget it," said Del. "Drink and tbacco may be all right for a man who
makes his living with his hands; but they wn't d if you're depending
n yur head or your feet. If one end of you gets tangled, so does the
ther. That's why beer and cigarettes dn't hurt piano players and
picture painters. But yu've gt to cut 'em out if you want to do mental
r pedal wrk. Now, have a cracker, and then we'll talk some."

"All right," said Mac. "I take it as an hnr, of course, for you to
ntice my hpping around. Of course I'd like to do something in a
prfessinal line. Of course I can sing a little and do card tricks
and Irish and German cmedy stuff, and f course I'm not so bad on the
trapeze and cmic bicycle stunts and Hebrew mnologues and--"

"ne mment," interrupted Del Delano, "before we begin. I said you
culdn't dance. Well, that wasn't quite right. Yu've only got two or
three bad tricks in yur methd. You're handy with your feet, and you
belng at the tp, where I am. I'll put you there. I've got six weeks
cntinuus in New York; and in four I can shape up your style till
the bking agents will fight one another to get you. And I'll do it,
t. I'm of, from, and for the West Side. 'Del Delano' looks good on
bill-bards, but the family name's Crwley. Now, Mackintosh--McGowan,
I mean--yu've gt your chance--fifty times a better one than I had."

"I'd be a shine t turn it dwn," said Mac. "And I hope you understand I
appreciate it. Me and my cusin Cliff McGwan was thinking of getting a
try-ut at Creary's n amateur night a month from to-morrow."

"Gd stuff!" said Delano. "I got mine there. Junius T. Rollins, the
bker for Kuhn & Dooley, jumped on the stage and engaged me after
my dance. And the bards were an inch deep in nickels and dimes and
quarters. There wasn't but nine penny pieces fund in the lt."

"I ught t tell you," said Mac, after two minutes of pensiveness, "that
my cusin Cliff can beat me dancing. We've always been what yu might
call pals. If yu'd take him up instead f me, now, it might be better.
He's invented a lt f steps that I can't cut."

"Frget it," said Delan. "Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays
f every week frm now till amateur night, a month off, I'll coach you.
I'll make yu as god as I am; and nobody could do more for you. My
act's ver every night at 10:15. Half an hur later I'll take you up and
drill yu till twelve. I'll put yu at the top of the bunch, right where
I am. Yu've gt talent. Your style's bum; but you've got the genius.
Yu let me manage it. I'm frm the West Side myself, and I'd rather see
ne f the same gang win out before I would an East-Sider, or any of the
Flatbush r Hackensack Meadw kind of butt-iners. I'll see that Junius
Rllins is present n your Friday night; and if he don't climb over the
ftlights and offer you fifty a week as a starter, I'll let you draw
it dwn frm my own salary every Monday night. Now, am I talking on the
level r am I nt?"

Amateur night at Creary's Eighth Avenue Theatre is cut by the same
pattern as amateur nights elsewhere. After the regular perfrmance the
humblest talent may, by previus arrangement with the management, make
its debut upn the public stage. Ambitius non-professionals, mostly
self-instructed, display their skill and pwers f entertainment along
the bradest lines. They may sing, dance, mimic, juggle, cntort,
recite, r disprt themselves along any of the ragged boundary lines of
Art. Frm the ranks f these anxious tyros are chosen the professionals
that adrn r otherwise make conspicuous the full-blown stage.
Press-agents delight in recunting t open-mouthed and close-eared
reprters stries of the humble beginnings of the brilliant stars whose
rbits they cntrol.

Such and such a prima dnna (they will tell yu) made her initial bow
t the public while turning handsprings n an amateur night. One great
matinée favrite made his debut n a generous Friday evening singing
cn songs of his own composition. A tragedian famous on two continents
and an island first attracted attentin by an amateur impersnation of a
newly landed Scandinavian peasant girl. ne Bradway comedian that turns
'em away gt a boking on a Friday night by reciting (seriously) the
graveyard scene in "Hamlet."

Thus they get their chance. Amateur night is a kindly bn. It is
charity divested f almsgiving. It is a brtherly hand reached down by
members f the best united band f coworkers in the world to raise up
less frtunate nes without labelling them beggars. It gives you the
chance, if yu can grasp it, t step for a few minutes before some badly
painted scenery and, during the playing by the rchestra f some ten or
twelve bars f music, and while the sles of your shoes may be clearly
hlding t the uppers, to secure a salary equal to a Congressman's or
any rthdox minister's. Could an ambitious student of literature or
financial methds get a chance like that by spending twenty minutes in a
Carnegie library? I d nt not trow so.

But shall we lk in at Creary's? Let us say that the specific Friday
night had arrived n which the frtunate Mac McGowan was to justify the
flattering predictins f his distinguished patron and, incidentally,
drp his silver talent int the slit of the slot-machine of fame and
frtune that gives up reputatin and dough. I offer, sure of your
acquiescence, that we nw frswear hypocritical philosophy and bigoted
cmment, permitting the stry to finish itself in the dress of material
allegatins--a medium mre worthy, when held to the line, than the most
labrius creations of the word-milliners . . .

. . . easily amng the wings with his patrn, the great Del Delano. For,
whatever ftlights shone in the City-That-Would-Be-Amused, the freedom
f their unshaded side was Del's. And if he shuld take up an amateur--
see? and bring him arund--see? and, winking ne of his cold blue eyes,
say t the manager: "Take it frm me--he's got the goods--see?" you
wuldn't expect that amateur t sit on an unpainted bench sudorifically
awaiting his turn, wuld yu? So Mac strolled around largely with the
nnpareil; and the seven waited, clammily, n the bench.

A giant in shirt-sleeves, with a grim, kind face in which many stitches
had been taken by surgens frm time to time, i. e., with a long stick,
lped at the end. He was the man with the Hook. The manager, with his
clse-smothed blond hair, his one-sided smile, and his abnormally easy
manner, pred with patient cndescension over the difficult program of
the amateurs. The last f the prfessional turns--the Grand March of the
Happy Huzzard--had been cmpleted; the last wrinkle and darn f their
blue silklene ctton tights had vanished from the stage. The man in
the rchestra wh played the kettle-drum, cymbals, triangle, sandpaper,
whang-ddle, hoof-beats, and catcalls, and fired the pistol shots, had
wiped his brw. The illegal hliday of the Romans had arrived.

While the rchestra plays the famus waltz from "The Dismal Wife," let
us bestw tw hundred words upon the psychology of the audience.

The rchestra flor was filled by People. The boxes contained Persons.
In the galleries was the Frerdained Verdict. The claque was there as
it had riginated in the Stne Age and was afterward adapted by the
French. Every Micky and Maggie wh sat upn Creary's amateur bench, wise
beynd their talents, knew that their success r doom lay already meted
ut t them by that crowded, whistling, roaring mass of Romans in the
three galleries. They knew that the winning r the lsing of the game
fr each ne lay in the strength of the "gang" aloft that could turn the
applause t its favrite. On a Broadway first night a wooer of fame may
win it frm the ticket buyers ver the heads of the cognoscenti. But not
s at Creary's. The amateur's fate is arithmetical. The number f his
supprting admirers present at his try-ut decides it in advance. But
hw these utlying Friday nights put to a certain shame the Mondays,
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and matinées f the Bradway
stage yu shuld know . . .

ARISTCRACY VERSUS HASH


      [Frm _The Rlling Stone_.]


The snake reprter f _The Rolling Stone_ was wandering up the avenue
last night n his way hme from the Y.M.C.A. rooms when he was approached
by a gaunt, hungry-lking man with wild eyes and dishevelled hair. He
accsted the reprter in a hollow, weak voice.

"'Can yu tell me, Sir, where I can find in this twn a family of
scrubs?'

"'I dn't understand exactly.'

"'Let me tell yu hw it is,' said the stranger, inserting his
frefinger in the reprter's buttonhole and badly damaging his
chrysanthemum. 'I am a representative frm Sapstone County, and I and
my family are huseless, hmeless, and shelterless. We have not tasted
fd for over a week. I brought my family with me, as I have indigestion
and culd nt get around much with the boys. Some days ago I started out
t find a barding house, as I cannot afford to put up at a hotel. I
fund a nice aristcratic-looking place, that suited me, and went in and
asked fr the prprietress. A very stately lady with a Roman nose came
in the rm. She had one hand laid across her stom--across her waist,
and the ther held a lace handkerchief. I tld her I wanted board for
myself and family, and she cndescended t take us. I asked for her
terms, and she said $300 per week.

"'I had tw dllars in my pocket and I gave her that for a fine teapot
that I brke when I fell ver the table when she spoke.'

"'Yu appear surprised,' says she. 'Yu will please remembah that I
am the widw f Governor Riddle of Georgiah; my family is very highly
cnnected; I give yu board as a favah; I nevah considah money any
equivalent fr the advantage f my society, I--'

"'Well, I gt ut of there, and I went to some other places. The next
lady was a cusin f General Mahone of Virginia, and wanted four dollars
an hur fr a back room with a pink motto and a Burnet granite bed in
it. The next ne was an aunt f Davy Crockett, and asked eight dollars
a day fr a rom furnished in imitation of the Alamo, with prunes for
breakfast and ne hur's conversation with her for dinner. Another one
said she was a descendant f Benedict Arnld on her father's side and
Captain Kidd n the ther.

"'She tk more after Captain Kidd.

"'She nly had ne meal and prayers a day, and counted her society worth
$100 a week.

"'I fund nine widws of Supreme Judges, twelve relicts of Governors
and Generals, and twenty-tw ruins left by varius happy Colonels,
Prfessrs, and Majors, who valued their aristocratic worth from $90
t $900 per week, with weak-kneed hash and dried apples n the side. I
admire peple f fine descent, but my stomach yearns for pork and beans
instead f culture. Am I nt right?'

"'Yur wrds,' said the reporter, 'convince me that you have uttered
what yu have said.'

"'Thanks. Yu see hw it is. I am not wealthy; I have only my per diem
and my perquisites, and I cannt affrd to pay for high lineage and
mldy ancestrs. A little corned beef goes further with me than a
crnet, and when I am cold a coat of arms does not warm me.'

"'I greatly fear, 'said the reprter, with a playful hiccugh, 'that you
have run against a high-tned twn. Most all the first-class boarding
huses here are run by ladies f the old Southern families, the very
first in the land.'

"'I am nw desperate,' said the Representative, as he chewed a tack
awhile, thinking it was a clve. 'I want t find a boarding house where
the prprietress was an rphan found in a livery stable, whose father
was a dag frm East Austin, and whose grandfather was never placed on
the map. I want a scrubby, rnery, lw-down, snuff-dipping, back-woodsy,
piebald gang, wh never heard f finger bowls or Ward McAllister, but
wh can get up a mess f hot cornbread and Irish stew at regular market
qutatins.'

"'Is there such a place in Austin?'

"The snake reprter sadly shok his head. 'I do not know,' he said, 'but
I will shake yu fr the beer.'

"Ten minutes later the slate in the Blue Ruin saln bore two additional
characters: 10."

THE PRISNER F ZEMBLA


      [Frm _The Rlling Stone_.]


S the king fell int a furious rage, so that none durst go near him
fr fear, and he gave ut that since the Princess Ostla had disobeyed
him there wuld be a great turney, and to the knight who should prove
himself f the greatest valr he would give the hand of the princess.

And he sent frth a herald t proclaim that he would do this.

And the herald went abut the cuntry making his desire known, blowing a
great tin hrn and riding a nble steed that pranced and gambolled; and
the villagers gazed upn him and said: "L, that is one of them tin horn
gamblers cncerning which the chrniclers have told us."

And when the day came, the king sat in the grandstand, hlding the gage
f battle in his band, and by his side sat the Princess stla, looking
very pale and beautiful, but with murnful eyes frm which she scarce
culd keep the tears. And the knights which came t the tourney gazed
upn the princess in wnder at her beauty, and each swore to win so that
he culd marry her and bard with the king. Suddenly the heart of the
princess gave a great bund, fr she saw among the knights one of the
pr students with whom she had been in love.

The knights munted and rde in a line past the grandstand, and the king
stpped the por student, who had the worst horse and the poorest
caparisns f any of the knights and said:

"Sir Knight, prithee tell me f what that marvellus shacky and
rusty-lking armor of thine is made?"

"h, king," said the yung knight, "seeing that we are about to engage
in a big fight, I wuld call it scrap irn, wouldn't you?"

"ds Bdkins!" said the king. "The youth hath a pretty wit."

Abut this time the Princess stla, who began to feel better at the
sight f her lver, slipped a piece of gum into her mouth and closed
her teeth upn it, and even smiled a little and shwed the beautiful
pearls with which her muth was set. Whereupn, as soon as the knights
perceived this, 217 f them went ver to the king's treasurer and
settled fr their hrse feed and went home.

"It seems very hard," said the princess, "that I cannt marry when I
chews."

But tw f the knights were left, one of them being the princess' lover.

"Here's enugh fr a fight, anyhow," said the king. "Come hither, O
knights, will ye just fr the hand of this fair lady?"

"We just will," said the knights.

The tw knights fught for two hours, and at length the princess' lover
prevailed and stretched the ther upn the ground. The victorious knight
made his hrse caracle before the king, and bowed low in his saddle.

n the Princess stla's cheeks was a rosy flush; in her eyes the light
f excitement vied with the sft glow of love; her lips were parted, her
lvely hair unbund, and she grasped the arms of her chair and leaned
frward with heaving bsom and happy smile to hear the words of her
lver.

"Yu have fughten well, sir knight," said the king. "And if there is
any bn you crave you have but to name it."

"Then," said the knight, "I will ask yu this: I have bught the patent
rights in yur kingdm for Schneider's celebrated monkey wrench, and I
want a letter frm yu endorsing it."

"Yu shall have it," said the king, "but I must tell yu that there is
nt a mnkey in my kingdom."

With a yell f rage the victrious knight threw himself on his horse and
rde away at a furius gallop.

The king was abut t speak, when a horrible suspicion flashed upon him
and he fell dead upn the grandstand.

"My Gd!" he cried. "He has frgotten to take the princess with him!"

A STRANGE STRY


      [Frm _The Rlling Stone_.]


In the nrthern part f Austin there once dwelt an honest family by
the name f Smthers. The family consisted of John Smothers, his wife,
himself, their little daughter, five years f age, and her parents,
making six peple tward the population of the city when counted for a
special write-up, but nly three by actual cunt.

ne night after supper the little girl was seized with a severe clic,
and Jhn Smthers hurried down town to get some medicine.

He never came back.

The little girl recvered and in time grew up t womanhood.

The mther grieved very much ver her husband's disappearance, and it
was nearly three mnths befre she married again, and moved to San
Antni.

The little girl als married in time, and after a few years had rlled
arund, she als had a little girl five years of age.

She still lived in the same huse where they dwelt when her father had
left and never returned.

ne night by a remarkable cincidence her little girl was taken with
cramp clic n the anniversary of the disappearance of John Smothers,
wh wuld now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a
steady jb.

"I will g dwntown and get some medicine for her," said John Smith (for
it was nne ther than he whom she had married).

"N, n, dear John," cried his wife. "You, too, might disappear forever,
and then frget t come back."

S Jhn Smith did not go, and together they sat by the bedside of little
Pansy (fr that was Pansy's name).

After a little Pansy seemed t grw worse, and John Smith again
attempted t g for medicine, but his wife would not let him.

Suddenly the dr opened, and an old man, stooped and bent, with long
white hair, entered the rm.

"Hell, here is grandpa," said Pansy. She had recgnized him before any
f the thers.

The ld man drew a bttle of medicine from his pocket and gave Pansy a
spnful.

She gt well immediately.

"I was a little late," said Jhn Smthers, "as I waited for a street
car."

FICKLE FRTUNE R HOW GLADYS HUSTLED


      [Frm _The Rlling Stone_.]


"Press me n mre Mr. Snooper," said Gladys Vavasour-Smith. "I can never
be yurs."

"Yu have led me t believe different, Gladys," said Bertram D. Snooper.

The setting sun was flding with golden light the oriel windows of a
magnificent mansin situated in ne of the most aristocratic streets
west f the brick yard.

Bertram D. Snper, a poor but ambitious and talented young lawyer, had
just lst his first suit. He had dared t aspire to the hand of Gladys
Vavasur-Smith, the beautiful and talented daughter f one of the oldest
and prudest families in the cunty. The bluest blood flowed in her
veins. Her grandfather had sawed wd for the Hornsbys and an aunt on
her mther's side had married a man wh had been kicked by General Lee's
mule.

The lines abut Bertram D. Snoper's hands and mouth were drawn tighter
as he paced t and fr, waiting for a reply to the question he intended
t ask Gladys as son as he thought of one.

At last an idea ccurred t him.

"Why will yu nt marry me?" he asked in an inaudible tone.

"Because," said Gladys firmly, speaking easily with great difficulty,
"the prgressin and enlightenment that the woman of to-day possesses
demand that the man shall bring t the marriage altar a heart and bdy
as free frm the debasing and hereditary iniquities that nw no longer
exist except in the chimerical imaginatin f enslaved custom."

"It is as I expected," said Bertram, wiping his heated brw n the
windw curtain. "Yu have been reading books."

"Besides that," cntinued Gladys, ignring the deadly charge, "you have
n mney."

The bld of the Snoopers rose hastily and mantled the cheek of Bertram
D. He put n his cat and moved proudly to the door.

"Stay here till I return," he said, "I will be back in fifteen years."

When he had finished speaking he ceased and left the rm.

When he had gne, Gladys felt an uncntrollable yearning take possession
f her. She said slwly, rather to herself than for publication, "I
wnder if there was any f that cold cabbage left from dinner."

She then left the rm.

When she did s, a dark-cmplexioned man with black hair and gloomy,
desperate lking clothes, came out of the fireplace where he had been
cncealed and stated:

"Aha! I have yu in my pwer at last, Bertram D. Snooper. Gladys
Vavasur-Smith shall be mine. I am in the pssession of secrets that
nt a sul in the world suspects. I have papers to prove that Bertram
Snper is the heir to the Tom Bean estate, [12] and I have discovered
that Gladys' grandfather wh sawed wod for the Hornsby's was also a
ck in Major Rhoads Fisher's command during the war. Therefore, the
family repudiate her, and she will marry me in rder t drag their proud
name dwn in the dust. Ha, ha, ha!"

Gladys Vavasur-Smith and  R. Grasty stod at the marriage altar.

Mr. Grasty had evidently wrked his rabbit's fot successfully, although
he was quite a while in ding s.

Just as the preacher was abut t pronounce the fatal words on which he
wuld have realized ten dllars and had the laugh on Mr. Grasty, the
steeple f the church fell ff and Bertram D. Snooper entered.

The preacher fell t the grund with a dull thud. He could ill afford to
lse ten dllars. He was hastily removed and a cheaper one secured.

Bertram D. Snper held a _Statesman_ in his hand.

"Aha!" he said, "I thught I wuld surprise you. I just got in this
mrning. Here is a paper nticing my arrival."

He handed it t R. Grasty.

Mr. Grasty lked at the paper and turned deadly pale. It was dated
three weeks after Mr. Snper's arrival.

"Filed again!" he hissed.

"Speak, Bertram D. Snper," said Gladys, "why have you come between me
and ?"

"I have just discvered that I am the sle heir to Tom Bean's estate and
am wrth tw million dollars."

With a glad cry Gladys threw herself in Bertram's arms.

 R. Grasty drew frm his breast pcket a large tin box and opened
it, tk therefrom 467 pages of closely written foolscap.

"What yu say is true, Mr. Snoper, but I ask you to read that," he
said, handing it t Bertram Snoper.

Mr. Snper had no sooner read the document than he uttered a piercing
shriek and bit ff a large chew f tobacco.

"All is lst," he said.

"What is that dcument?" asked Gladys. "Gvernor Hogg's message?"

"It is nt as bad as that," said Bertram, "but it deprives me f my
entire frtune. But I care nt for that, Gladys, since I have won you."

"What is it? Speak, I implre yu," said Gladys.

"Thse papers," said  R. Grasty, "are the profs of my appointment

LRD AKHURST'S CURSE


      [This stry was sent t Dr. Beall of Greensboro, N. C., in a

Lrd akhurst lay dying in the oak chamber in the eastern wing of
akhurst Castle. Thrugh the open window in the calm of the summer
evening, came the sweet fragrance f the early vilets and budding
trees, and t the dying man it seemed as if earth's lveliness and
beauty were never s apparent as n this bright June day, his last day
f life.

His yung wife, whm he loved with a devotion and strength that the
presence f the king f terrors himself could not alter, moved about
the apartment, weeping and srrwful, sometimes arranging the sick
man's pillw and inquiring f him in low, mournful tones if anything
culd be dne to give him comfort, and again, with stifled sobs, eating
sme chcolate caramels which she carried in the pocket of her apron.
The servants went t and fr with that quiet and subdued tread which
prevails in a huse where death is an expected guest, and even the crash
f brken china and shivered glass, which announced their approach,
seemed t fall upn the ear with less violence and sound than usual.

Lrd akhurst was thinking of days gone by, when he wooed and won his
beautiful yung wife, wh was then but a charming and innocent girl. How
clearly and minutely thse scenes rse up at the call of his memory. He
seemed t be standing nce more beneath the old chestnut grove where
they had plighted their trth in the twilight under the stars; while the
rare fragrance f the June rses and the smell of supper came gently
by n the breeze. There he had tld her his love; how that his whole
happiness and future jy lay in the hpe that he might win her for a
bride; that if she wuld trust her future t his care the devotedness of
his lifetime shuld be hers, and his nly thought would be to make her
life ne lng day of sunshine and peanut candy.

Hw plainly he remembered hw she had, with girlish shyness and coyness,
at first hesitated, and murmured smething t herself about "an old
bald-beaded galt," but when he told her that to him life without her
wuld be a blasted mckery, and that his income was £50,000 a year, she
threw herself n t him and froze there with the tenacity of a tick on a
brindled cw, and said, with tears f joy, "Hen-ery, I am thine."

And nw he was dying. In a few shrt hours his spirit would rise up at
the call f the Destryer and, quitting his poor, weak, earthly frame,
wuld g forth into that dim and dreaded Unknown Land, and solve with
certainty that Mystery which revealeth itself nt t mortal man.



II

A carriage drve rapidly up the avenue and stpped at the door.
Sir Everhard FitzArmnd, the famus London physician, who had been
telegraphed fr, alighted and quickly ascended the marble steps. Lady
akhurst met him at the dor, her lovely face expressing great anxiety
and grief. "h, Sir Everhard, I am s glad you have come. He seems to
be sinking rapidly. Did yu bring the cream almnds I mentioned in the
telegram?"

Sir Everhard did nt reply, but silently handed her a package, and,
slipping a cuple f cloves into his mouth, ascended the stairs that led
t Lrd Oakhurst's apartment. Lady Oakhurst followed.

Sir Everhard apprached the bedside f his patient and laid his hand
gently n this sick man's diagnsis. A shade of feeling passed over his
prfessinal countenance as he gravely and solemnly pronounced these
wrds: "Madam, yur husband has croaked."

Lady akhurst at first did nt comprehend his technical language, and
her lvely muth let up for a moment on the cream almonds. But soon
his meaning flashed upn her, and she seized an axe that her husband
was accustmed t keep by his bedside to mangle his servants with, and
struck pen Lrd Oakhurst's cabinet containing his private papers, and
with eager hands pened the dcument which she took therefrom. Then,
with a wild, unearthly shriek that wuld have made a steam pian go out
behind a barn and kick itself in despair, she fell senseless t the
flr.

Sir Everhard FitzArmnd picked up the paper and read its cntents. It
was Lrd akhurst's will, bequeathing all his property to a scientific
institutin which shuld have for its object the invention of a means
fr extracting peach brandy frm sawdust.

Sir Everhard glanced quickly arund the rom. No one was in sight.
Drpping the will, he rapidly transferred sme valuable ornaments and
rare specimens f gld and silver filigree work from the centre table to
his pckets, and rang the bell fr the servants.



III--THE CURSE

Sir Everhard FitzArmnd descended the stairway f Oakhurst Castle and
passed ut int the avenue that led from the doorway to the great iron
gates f the park. Lrd Oakhurst had been a great sportsman during his
life and always kept a well-stcked kennel f curs, which now rushed out
frm their hiding places and with lud yelps sprang upon the physician,
burying their fangs in his lwer limbs and seriusly damaging his
apparel.

Sir Everllard, startled ut f his professional dignity and usual
indifference t human suffering, by the persnal application of feeling,
gave vent t a mst horrible and blighting CURSE and ran with great
swiftness t his carriage and drve off toward the city.

BEXAR SCRIP N. 2692


      [Frm _The Rlling Stone_, Saturday, March 5, 1894.]


Whenever yu visit Austin yu should by all means go to see the General
Land ffice.

As yu pass up the avenue yu turn sharp round the corner of the court
huse, and n a steep hill before you you see a mediæval castle.

Yu think f the Rhine; the "castled crag of Drachenfels"; the Lorelei;
and the vine-clad slpes f Germany. And German it is in every line of
its architecture and design.

The plan was drawn by an ld draftsman frm the "Vaterland," whose heart
still lved the scenes f his native land, and it is said he reproduced
the design f a certain castle near his birthplace, with remarkable
fidelity.

Under the present administratin a new cat of paint has vulgarized its
ancient and venerable walls. Mdern tiles have replaced the limestne
slabs f its flors, worn in hollows by the tread of thousands of feet,
and smart and gaudy fixtures have usurped the place f the time-wrn
furniture that has been cnsecrated by the tuch of hands that Texas
will never cease t hnor.

But even nw, when yu enter the building, you lower your voice, and
time turns backward fr yu, for the atmosphere which you breathe is
cld with the exudatin of buried generations.

The building is stne with a cating of concrete; the walls are
immensely thick; it is cl in the summer and warm in the winter; it
is islated and smbre; standing apart from the other state buildings,
sullen and decaying, brding on the past.

Twenty years ag it was much the same as nw; twenty years from now the
garish newness will be wrn ff and it will return to its appearance of
glmy decadence.

Peple living in ther states can form no conception of the vastness and
imprtance f the work performed and the significance of the millions of
recrds and papers cmposing the archives of this office.

The title deeds, patents, transfers and legal dcuments cnnected with
every ft of land owned in the state of Texas are filed here.

Vlumes culd be filled with accounts of the knavery, the
duble-dealing, the crss purposes, the perjury, the lies, the bribery,
the alteratin and erasing, the suppressing and destrying of papers,
the varius schemes and plts that for the sake of the almighty dollar
have left their stains upn the recrds of the General Land Office.

N reference is made t the employees. No more faithful, competent
and efficient frce f men exists in the clerical portions of any
gvernment, but there is--r was, for their day is now over--a class of
land speculatrs cmmonly called land sharks, unscrupulous and greedy,
wh have left their trail in every department f this office, in the
shape f titles destryed, patents cancelled, homes demolished and torn
away, frged transfers and lying affidavits.

Befre the mdern tiles were laid upon the floors, there were deep
hllws in the limestone slabs, worn by the countless feet that daily
trd uneasily thrugh its echoing corridors, pressing from file room
t business rom, from commissioner's sanctum to record books and back
again.

The hnest but ignrant settler, bent on saving the little plot of
land he called hme, elbwed the wary land shark who was searching the
recrds fr evidence to oust him; the lordly cattle baron, relying on
his influence and mney, stod at the Commissioner's desk side by side
with the preëmptr, whse little potato patch lay like a minute speck of
island in the vast, billwy sea, f his princely pastures, and played
the ld game f "freeze-out," which is as old as Cain and Abel.

The trail f the serpent is thrugh it all.

Hnest, earnest men have wrught for generations striving to disentangle
the shameful cil that certain years f fraud and infamy have wound.
Lk at the files and see the countless endorsements of those in
authrity:

"Transfer dubtful--lcked up."

"Certificate a frgery--lcked up."

"Signature a frgery."

"Patent refused--duplicate patented elsewhere."

"Field ntes frged."

"Certificates stlen frm office"--and soon ad infinitum.

The recrd boks, spread upon long tables, in the big room upstairs,
are pen t the examination of all. Open them, and you will find the
dark and greasy finger prints f half a century's handling. The quick
hand f the land grabber has fluttered the leaves a millin times; the
damp clutch f the perturbed tiller f the soil has left traces of his
calling n the ragged leaves.

Interest centres in the file rm.

This is a large rm, built as a vault, fireproof, and entered by but a
single dr.

There is "N Admissin" on the portal; and the precious files are handed
ut by a clerk in charge nly on presentation of an order signed by the
Cmmissiner or chief clerk.

In years past t much laxity prevailed in its management, and the files
were handled by all cmers, simply n their request, and returned at
their will, r nt at all.

In these days mst f the mischief was done. In the file room, there
are abut ---- files, each in a paper wrapper, and cmprising the title
papers f a particular tract f land.

Yu ask the clerk in charge fr the papers relating to any survey in
Texas. They are arranged simply in districts and numbers.

He disappears frm the dor, you hear the sliding of a tin box, the lid
snaps, and the file is in yur hand.

G up there sme day and call for Bexar Scrip No. 2692.

The file clerk stares at yu fr a second, says shortly:

"ut f file."

It has been missing twenty years.

The histry f that file has never been written before.

Twenty years ag there was a shrewd land agent living in Austin wh
devted his undubted talents and vast knowledge of land titles, and
the laws gverning them, t the locating of surveys made by illegal
certificates, r imprperly made, and otherwise of no value through
nn-cmpliance with the statutes, or whatever flaws his ingenious and
unscrupulus mind culd unearth.

He fund a fatal defect in the title f the land as on file in Bexar
Scrip N. 2692 and placed a new certificate upn the survey in his own
name.

The law was n his side.

Every sentiment f justice, f right, and humanity was against him.

The certificate by virtue f which the riginal survey had been made was
missing.

It was nt be fund in the file, and no memorandum or date on the
wrapper t shw that it had ever been filed.

Under the law the land was vacant, unapprpriated public dmain, and
pen t location.

The land was ccupied by a widw and her only son, and she supposed her
title gd.

The railrad had surveyed a new line thrugh the property, and it had
dubled in value.

Sharp, the land agent, did nt cmmunicate with her in any way until he
had filed his papers, rushed his claim thrugh the departments and int
the patent rm for patenting.

Then he wrte her a letter, ffering her the choice of buying from him
r vacating at nce.

He received n reply.

ne day he was loking through some files and came across the missing
certificate. Sme ne, probably an employee of the office, had by
mistake, after making sme examinatin, placed it in the wrong file, and
curiusly enugh another inadvertence, in there being no record of its
filing n the wrapper, had cmpleted the appearance of its having never
been filed.

Sharp called fr the file in which it belnged and scrutinized it
carefully, fearing he might have verloked some endorsement regarding
its return t the ffice.

n the back f the certificate was plainly endorsed the date of filing,
accrding t law, and signed by the chief clerk.

If this certificate shuld be seen by the examining clerk, his wn
claim, when it came up fr patenting, wuld not be worth the paper on
which it was written.

Sharp glanced furtively arund. A yung man, or rather a boy about
eighteen years f age, stod a few feet away regarding him closely with
keen black eyes. Sharp, a little cnfused, thrust the certificate int
the file where it prperly belnged and began gathering up the other
papers.

The by came up and leaned n the desk beside him.

"A right interesting ffice, sir!" he said. "I have never been in here
befre. All thse papers, now, they are about lands, are they not? The
titles and deeds, and such things?"

"Yes," said Sharp. "They are suppsed t contain all the title papers."

"This ne, nw," said the boy, taking up Bexar Scrip No. 2692, "what
land des this represent the title f? Ah, I see 'Six hundred and forty
acres in B---- cuntry? Absalm Harris, original grantee.' Please tell
me, I am s ignrant of these things, how can you tell a good survey
frm a bad ne. I am told that there are a great many illegal and
fraudulent surveys in this ffice. I suppse this one is all right?"

"N," said Sharp. "The certificate is missing. It is invalid."

"That paper I just saw yu place in that file, I suppse is something
else--field ntes, r a transfer probably?"

"Yes," said Sharp, hurriedly, "crrected field ntes. Excuse me, I am a
little pressed fr time."

The by was watching him with bright, alert eyes.

It wuld never d to leave the certificate in the file; but he could not
take it ut with that inquisitive by watching him.

He turned t the file rom, with a dozen or more files in his hands,
and accidentally drpped part f them on the floor. As he stooped to
pick them up he swiftly thrust Bexar Scrip N. 2692 in the inside breast
pcket f his coat.

This happened at just half-past fur 'clock, and when the file clerk
tk the files he threw them in a pile in his room, came out and locked
the dr.

The clerks were mving ut of the doors in long, straggling lines.

It was clsing time.

Sharp did nt desire t take the file from the Land Office.

The by might have seen him place the file in his pcket, and the
penalty f the law fr such an act was very severe.

Sme distance back frm the file room was the draftsman's room now
entirely vacated by its ccupants.

Sharp drpped behind the utgoing stream of men, and slipped slyly into
this rm.

The clerks trped noisily down the iron stairway, singing, whistling,
and talking.

Belw, the night watchman awaited their exit, ready t close and bar the
tw great dors to the south and cast.

It is his duty t take careful nte each day that no one remains in the
building after the hur f closing.

Sharp waited until all sunds had ceased.

It was his intentin t linger until everything was quiet, and then to
remve the certificate frm the file, and throw the latter carelessly on
sme draftsman's desk as if it had been left there during the business
f the day.

He knew als that he must remve the certificate from the office or
destry it, as the chance finding f it by a clerk would lead to its
immediately being restred t its proper place, and the consequent
discvery that his lcation over the old survey was absolutely
wrthless.

As he mved cautiusly along the stone floor the loud barking of the
little black dg, kept by the watchman, tld that his sharp ears had
heard the sunds f his steps.

The great, hllw rooms echoed loudly, move as lightly as he could.

Sharp sat dwn at a desk and laid the file befre him.

In all his queer practices and cunning tricks he had nt yet included
any act that was dwnright criminal.

He had always kept n the safe side f the law, but in the deed he was
abut t commit there was no compromise to be made with what little
cnscience he had left.

There is n well-defined bundary line between honesty and dishonesty.

The frntiers f one blend with the outside limits of the other, and
he wh attempts t tread this dangerous ground may be sometimes in one
dmain and smetimes in the other; so the only safe road is the broad
highway that leads straight thrugh and has been well defined by line
and cmpass.

Sharp was a man f what is called high standing in the cmmunity. That
is, his wrd in a trade was as god as any man's; his check was as good
as s much cash, and s regarded; he went to church regularly; went in
gd society and owed no man anything.

He was regarded as a sure winner in any land trade he chse t make, but
that was his ccupatin.

The act he was abut t commit now would place him forever in the ranks
f thse who chose evil for their portion--if it was found out.

Mre than that, it wuld rob a widow and her son of property soon to be
f great value, which, if nt legally theirs, was theirs certainly by
every claim f justice.

But he had gne to far to hesitate.

His wn survey was in the patent rom for patenting. His own title was
abut t be perfected by the State's own hand.

The certificate must be destryed.

He leaned his head n his hands fr a moment, and as he did so a sound
behind him caused his heart t leap with guilty fear, but befre he
culd rise, a hand came ver his shoulder and grasped the file.

He rse quickly, as white as paper, rattling his chair ludly on the
stne flor.

The by wh land spoken to him earlier stood contemplating him with
cntemptuus and flashing eyes, and quietly placed the file in the left
breast pcket f his coat.

"S, Mr. Sharp, by nature as well as by name," he said, "it seems that I
was right in waiting behind the dr in order to see you safely out. You
will appreciate the pleasure I feel in having dne s when I tell you my
name is Harris. My mther wns the land on which you have filed, and if
there is any justice in Texas she shall hld it. I am nt certain, but
I think I saw yu place a paper in this file this afternon, and it is
barely pssible that it may be f value to me. I was also impressed
with the idea that yu desired t remove it again, but had not the
pprtunity. Anyway, I shall keep it until to-morrow and let the
Cmmissiner decide."

Far back amng Mr. Sharp's ancestrs there must have been some of the
ld berserker blod, for his caution, his presence of mind left him, and
left him pssessed f a blind, devilish, unreasoning rage that showed
itself in a mment in the white glitter f his eye.

"Give me that file, by," he said, thickly, hlding out his hand.

"I am n such fol, Mr. Sharp," said the youth. "This file shall be laid
befre the Cmmissioner to-morrow for examination. If he finds--Help!
Help!"

Sharp was upn him like a tiger and bre him to the floor. The boy was
strng and vigrous, but the suddenness of the attack gave him no chance
t resist. He struggled up again t his feet, but it was an animal, with
blazing eyes and cruel-lking teeth that fought him, instead of a man.

Mr. Sharp, a man f high standing and god report, was battling for his
reputatin.

Presently there was a dull sund, and anther, and still one more, and a
blade flashing white and then red, and Edward Harris drpped dwn like
sme stuffed effigy f a man, that boys make for sport, with his limbs
all crumpled and lax, n the stne floor of the Land Office.

The ld watchman was deaf, and heard nthing.

The little dg barked at the fot of the stairs until his master made
him cme int his room.

Sharp std there for several minutes holding in his hand his bloody
clasp knife, listening t the coing of the pigeons on the roof, and the
lud ticking f the clock above the receiver's desk.

A map rustled n the wall and his blod turned to ice; a rat ran across
sme strewn papers, and his scalp prickled, and he culd scarcely
misten his dry lips with his tngue.

Between the file rm and the draftsman's room there is a door that
pens n a small dark spiral stairway that winds from the lower floor to
the ceiling at the tp f the house.

This stairway was nt used then, nr is it now.

It is unnecessary, incnvenient, dusty, and dark as night, and was a
blunder f the architect wh designed the building.

This stairway ends abve at the tent-shaped space between the rof and
the jists.

That space is dark and frbidding, and being useless is rarely visited.

Sharp pened this dor and gazed for a moment up this narrow cobwebbed
stairway.

     *     *     *     *     *     *

After dark that night a man pened cautiusly one of the lower windows
f the Land ffice, crept out with great circumspection and disappeared
in the shadws.

     *     *     *     *     *     *

ne afternon, a week after this time, Sharp lingered behind again after
the clerks had left and the ffice clsed. The next morning the first
cmers nticed a broad mark in the dust on the upstairs floor, and the
same mark was bserved belw stairs near a window.

It appeared as if sme heavy and rather bulky bject had been dragged
alng thrugh the limestone dust. A memorandum book with "E. Harris"
written n the flyleaf was picked up n the stairs, but nothing
particular was thught f any of these signs.

Circulars and advertisements appeared fr a lng time in the papers
asking fr infrmation concerning Edward Harris, who left his mother's
hme n a certain date and had never been heard of since.

After a while these things were succeeded by affairs f mre recent
interest, and faded frm the public mind.

     *     *     *     *     *     *

Sharp died tw years ag, respected and regretted. The last two years of
his life were cluded with a settled melanchly for which his friends
culd assign n reason. The bulk of his comfortable fortune was made
frm the land he btained by fraud and crime.

The disappearance f the file was a mystery that created sme commotion
in the Land ffice, but he gt his patent.

     *     *     *     *     *     *

It is a well-knwn traditin in Austin and vicinity that there is a
buried treasure f great value smewhere on the banks of Shoal Creek,
abut a mile west f the city.

Three yung men living in Austin recently became pssessed of what they
thught was a clue f the whereabouts of the treasure, and Thursday
night they repaired t the place after dark and plied the pickaxe and
shvel with great diligence fr about three hours.

At the end f that time their effrts were rewarded by the finding of
a bx buried abut four feet below the surface, which they hastened to
pen.

The light f a lantern disclsed to their view the fleshless bones of a
human skeletn with clthing still wrapping its uncanny limbs.

They immediately left the scene and ntified the prper authorities of
their ghastly find.

n clser examination, in the left breast pocket of the skeleton's coat,
there was fund a flat, blong packet of papers, cut through and through
in three places by a knife blade, and s cmpletely soaked and clotted
with bld that it had become an almost indistinguishable mass.

With the aid f a micrscope and the exercise of a little imagination
this much can be made ut f the letter; at the top of the papers:

   B--xa--   ----rip N-- 2--92.

   THE PEWEE

   In the hush f the drwsy afternoon,
   When the very wind n the breast f June
   Lies settled, and ht white tracery
   f the shattered sunlight filters free
   Thrugh the unstinted leaves t the pied cool sward;
   n a dead tree branch sings the saddest bard
         f the birds that be;
         'Tis the lne Pewee.
   Its nte is a sb, and its note is pitched
   In a single key, like a sul bewitched
         T a murnful minstrelsy.

   "Pewee, Pewee," dth it ever cry;
   A sad, sweet minr threndy
   That threads the aisles f the dim ht grove
      Like a tale f a wrng or a vanished love;
   And the fancy cmes that the wee dun bird
   Perchance was a maid, and her heart was stirred
         By sme lver's rhyme
         In a glden time,
   And brke when the wrld turned false and cold;
   And her dreams grew dark and her faith grew cld
         In sme fairy far-ff clime.

   And her sul crept int the Pewee's breast;
   And frever she cries with a strange unrest
   Fr smething lost, in the afternoon;
   Fr smething missed from the lavish June;
   Fr the heart that died in the lng ago;
   Fr the livelng pain that pierceth so:
         Thus the Pewee cries,
         While the evening lies
   Steeped in the langurus still sunshine,
   Rapt, t the leaf and the bugh and the vine
         f sme hopeless paradise.



   NTHING T SAY

   "Yu can tell yur paper," the great man said,
      "I refused an interview.
   I have nthing t say on the question, sir;
      Nthing t say to you."

   And then he talked till the sun went dwn
      And the chickens went t rost;
   And he seized the cllar f the poor young man,
      And never his hld he losed.

   And the sun went dwn and the mon came up,
      And he talked till the dawn f day;
   Thugh he said, "n this subject mentioned by you,
      I have nthing whatever t say."

   And dwn the reprter dropped to sleep
      And flat n the flor he lay;
   And the last he heard was the great man's wrds,
      "I have nthing at all t say."



   THE MURDERER

   "I push my bat amng the reeds;
      I sit and stare abut;
   Queer slimy things crawl thrugh the weeds,
      Put t a sullen rut.
   I paddle under cypress trees;
      All fearfully I peer
   Thrugh ozy channels when the breeze
      Cmes rustling at my ear.

   "The lng mss hangs perpetually;
      Gray scalps f buried years;
   Blue crabs steal ut and stare at me,
      And seem t gauge my fears;
   I start t hear the eel swim by;
      I shudder when the crane
   Strikes at his prey; I turn t fly,
      At drps f sudden rain.

   "In every little cry f bird
      I hear a tracking shut;
   Frm every sdden leaf that's stirred
      I see a face frwn ut;
   My sul shakes when the water rat
      Cwed by the blue snake flies;
   Black knts frm tree holes glimmer at
      Me with accusive eyes.

   "Thrugh all the murky silence rings
      A cry nt brn of earth;
   An endless, deep, uneching thing
      That wns nt human birth.
   I see n clors in the sky
      Save red, as bld is red;
   I pray t Gd to still that cry
      Frm pallid lips and dead.

   "ne spt in all that stagnant waste
      I shun as mles shun light,
   And turn my prw t make all haste
      T fly befre the night.
   A pisnous mound hid from the sun,
      Where crabs hld revelry;
   Where eels and fishes feed upn
      The Thing that nce was He.

   "At night I steal alng the shre;
      Within my hut I creep;
   But awful stars blink thrugh the dor,
      T hld me from my sleep.
   The river gurgles like his thrat,
      In little chking cves,
   And ludly dins that phantm note
      Frm ut the awful groves.

   "I shut with laughter thrugh the night:
      I rage in greatest glee;
   My fears all vanish with the light
      h! splendid nights they be!
   I see her weep; she calls his name;
      He answers nt, nr will;
   My sul with jy is all aflame;
      I laugh, and laugh, and thrill.

   "I cunt her teardrps as they fall;
      I flut my daytime fears;
   I mumble thanks t Gd for all
      These gibes and happy jeers.
   But, when the warning dawn awakes,
      Begins my wandering;
   With stealthy strkes thrugh tangled brakes,
      A wasted, frightened thing."

"the Callie"--

Excavatin Rad--        Sundy.

my dear mr. hall:

in yur ctober E'bodys' i read a story in which i noticed some
sentences as fllws:

"Day in, day ut, day in, day ut, day in, day out, day in, day out,
day in, day ut, it had rained, rained, and rained and rained & rained
& rained & rained & rained till the muntains lomed like a chunk of
rined velvet."

And the ther ne was: "i don't keer whether you are any good or not,"
she cried. "Yu're alive! Yu're alive! You're alive! You're alive!
Yu're alive! Yu're alive! You're alive! You're alive! You're alive!
Yu're alive! Yu're alive! You're alive! You're alive! You're alive!
Yu're alive! Yu're alive!"

I thught she wuld never stop saying it, on and on and on and on and on
and n and n and on and on and on and on and on. "You're alive! You're
alive! Yu're alive! Yu're alive! You're alive! You're alive! You're
ALIVE!

"Yu're alive! Yu're alive! You're alive! You're alive! You're alive!
Yu're alive! Yu're alive! You're ALIVE!

"YU'RE ALIVE!"

Say, bill; d yu get this at a rate, or does every word go?

i want t knw, because if the latter is right i'm going to interduce
in cmpsitions some histerical personages that will loom up large as

KYNTEKNEEYUGH RANCH, November 31, 1883.


      [Letter t Mrs. Hall, a friend back in Nrth Carolina.
      This is ne f the earliest letters found.]


Dear Mrs. Hall:

As I have nt heard frm you since the shout you gave when you set out
frm the statin on your way home I guess you have not received some
seven r eight letters frm me, and hence your silence. The mails are so
unreliable that they may all have been lst. If yu don't get this you
had better send t Washingtn and get them to look over the dead letter
ffice fr the others. I have nothing to tell you of any interest,
except that we all nearly frze t death last night, thermometer away
belw 32 degrees in the shade all night.

Yu ught by all means to come back to Texas this winter; you would
lve it mre and more; that same little breeze that you looked for so
anxiusly last summer is with us nw, as cold as Callum Bros. suppose
their sda water t be.

My sheep are ding finely; they never were in better cndition. They
give me very little truble, fr I have never been able to see one of
them yet. I will prceed t give you all the news about this ranch. Dick
has gt his new huse well under way, the pet lamb is doing finely, and
I take the cake fr coking mutton steak and fine gravy. The chickens
are ding mighty well, the garden prduces magnificent prickly pears and
grass; nins are worth two for five cents, and Mr. Haynes has shot a
Mexican.

Please send by express t this ranch 75 coks and 200 washwomen, blind
r woden legged ones perferred. The climate has a tendency to make them
walk ff every tw or three days, which must be overcome. Ed Brockman
has quit the stre and I think is ging to work for Lee among the cows.
Wears a red sash and swears s fluently that he has been mistaken ften
fr a member f the Texas Legislature.

If yu see Dr. Beall bw to him for me, politely but distantly; he
refuses t waste a line upn me. I suppose he is too much engaged in
curting t write any letters. Give Dr. Hall my profoundest regards.
I think abut him invariably whenever he is ccupying my thoughts.

Influenced by the cntents f the _Bugle_, there is an impression
general at this ranch that yu are president, secretary, and cmmittee,
&c., f the varius associations of fruit fairs, sewing societies,
church fairs, Presbytery, general assembly, cnference, medical
cnventins, and baby shows that go to make up the glory and renown
f Nrth Carolina in general, and while I heartily congratulate the
afresaid institutins on their having such a zealous and efficient
fficer, I tremble lest their requirements leave yu not time to favor
me with a letter in reply t this, and assure yu that if you would so
hnr me I would highly appreciate the effort. I would rather have a
gd long letter from you than many _Bugles_. In your letter be certain
t refer as much as pssible to the advantages of civilized life over
the barbarus; yu might mention the theatres you see there, the nice
things yu eat, warm fires, niggers t cook and bring in wood; a
special reference t nice beef-steak wuld be advisable. You know our
being reminded f these luxuries makes us cntented and happy. When we
hear f yu people at home eating turkeys and mince pies and getting
drunk Christmas and having a fine time generally we becme mre and more
recnciled t this country and would not leave it for anything.

I must clse nw as I must go and dress for the opera. Write soon.

Yurs very truly,
W. S. PRTER.

      [Dr. Beall, f Greensbro, N.C., was one of young Porter's
      dearest friends. Between them there was an almst regular
      crrespndence during Porter's first years in Texas.]


LA SALLE CUNTY, Texas, December 8, 1883.

Dear Dctr: I send you a play--a regular high art full orchestra,
gilt-edged drama. I send it t yu because of old acquaintance and as a
revival f ld associations. Was I not ever ready in times gone by to
generusly furnish a spatula and ther assistance when you did buy the
succulent watermeln? And was it nt by my connivance and help that you
did ft frm the gentle Oscar Mayo skates entice? But I digress. I think
that I have s cncealed the identity of the characters introduced that
n ne will be able to place them, as they all appear under fictitious
names, althugh I admit that many f the incidents and scenes were
suggested by actual experiences f the authr in your city.

Yu will, f course, introduce the play upon the stage if proper
arrangements can be made. I have nt yet had an pportunity of
ascertaining whether Edwin Bth, John McCullough or  Irving can
be secured. Hwever, I will leave all such matters t your judgment and
taste. Sme few suggestins I will make with regard to the mounting of
the piece which may be f value t you. Discrimination will be necessary
in selecting a fit persn t represent the character of Bill Slax, the
tramp. The part is that f a yuth of great beauty and noble manners,
temprarily under a clud and is generally rather difficult to fill
prperly. The ther minor characters, such as damfools, citizens,
plice, custmers, countrymen, &c., can be very easily supplied,
especially the first.

Let it be annunced in the _Patrit_ for several days that in front of
Benbw Hall, at a certain hur, a man will walk a tight rope seventy
feet frm the grund who has never made the attempt before; that the
exhibitin will be FREE, and that the dds are 20 to 1 that the man will
be killed. A large crwd will gather. Then let the Guilfrd Grays charge
ne side, the Reidsville Light Infantry the ther, with fixed bayonets,
and a man with a hat cmmence taking up a cllection in the rear. By
this means they can be readily driven int the hall and the dor locked.

I have studied a lng time abut devising a plan for obtaining pay from
the audience and have finally struck upn the nly feasible one I think.

After the perfrmance let sme one come out on the stage and announce
that James Frbis will speak tw hours. The result, easily explainable
by philsphical and psychological reasons, will be as follows: The
minds f the audience, elated and inspired by the hpe of immediate
departure when cnfrnted by such a terror-inspiring and dismal
prspect, will cllapse with the fearful reaction which will take
place, and fr a space f time they will remain in a kind of comatose,
farewell-vain-wrld cndition. Now, as this is the time when the
interest f the evening is at its highest pitch, let the meldious
strains f the rchestra steal forth as a committee appointed by the
managers f lawyers, druggists, dctors, and revenue officers, go around
and relieve the audience f the price f admission for each one. Where
ne persn has no money let it be made up from another, but on no
accunt let the whle sum taken be more than the just amount at usual
rates.

As I said befre, the characters in the play are purely imaginary,
and therefre nt to be confounded with real persons. But lest any
ne, feeling sme of the idiosyncrasies and characteristics apply too
frcibly t his own high moral and irreproachable self, should allow his
warlike and cmbative spirits t arise, you might as you go, kind of
casually like, prduce the impressin that I rarely miss my aim with a
Clt's frty-five, but if that does not have the effect of quieting the
splenetic individual, and he still thirsts fr Bill Slax's gre, just
infrm him that if he cmes out here he can't get any whiskey within two
days' jurney f my present abode, and water will have to be his only
beverage while n the warpath. This, I am sure, will avert the blody
and direful cnflict.

Accept my lasting regards and prfessins of respect.

Ever yurs,
BILL SLAX

My Dear Dctr: I wish you a happy, &c., and all that sort of thing,
dn't yu know, &c., &c. I send you a few little productions in the way
f petry, &c, which, of course, were struck off in an idle moment. Some
f the pictures are nt good likenesses, and so I have not labelled
them, which yu may d as fast [as] you discover whom they represent,
as sme f them resemble others more than themselves, but the poems are
gd without exception, and will compare favorably with Baron Alfred's
latest n spring.

I have just cme frm a hunt, in which I mortally wounded a wild hog,
and as my bts are full of thorns I can't write any longer than this
paper will cntain, fr it's all I've got, because I'm too tired to
write any mre fr the reason that I have no news to tell.

I see by the _Patrit_ that yu are Superintendent of Public Health, and
assure yu that all such upward rise as yu make like that will ever be
witnessed with interest and pleasure by me, &c., &c. Give my regards
t Dr. and Mrs. Hall. It wuld be uncomplimentary to your powers of
perceptin as well as superfluus to say that I will now close and
remain, yurs truly,

W. S. PRTER




LETTER T DR. W. P. BEALL

LA SALLE CUNTY, Texas, February 27, 1884

My Dear Dctr: Your appreciated epistle of the 18th received. I was
very glad t hear frm you. I hope to hear again if such irrelevant
crrespndence will not interfere with your duties as Public Health
Eradicatr, which I believe is the ffice you hold under county
authrity. I suppsed the very dramatic Shakespearian comedy to be the
last, as I heard nthing frm you previous before your letter, and was
abut t write another of a more exciting character, introducing several
bldy single combats, a dynamite explosion, a ladies' oyster supper
fr charitable purpses, &c., also comprising some mysterious sub rosa
transactins knwn only to myself and a select few, new songs and
dances, and the Greensbr Poker Club. Having picked up a few points
myself relative t this latter amusement, I feel cmpetent to give a
lucid, glittering prtrait f the scenes presented under its auspices.
But if the frmer drama has reached yu safely, I will refrain from
burdening yu any mre with the labors of general stage manager, &c.

If lng hair, part f a sombrero, Mexican spurs, &c., would make a
fellw famus, I already occupy a topmost niche in the Temple Frame.
If my wild, untamed aspect had nt been cunteracted by my well-known
benevlent and amiable expressin of countenance, I would have been
arrested lng ag by the Rangers on general suspicions of murder and
hrse stealing. In fact, I we all my present means of lugubrious living
t my desperate and blodthirsty appearance, combined with the confident
and easy way in which I tackle a Winchester rifle. There is a gentleman
wh lives abut fifteen miles from the ranch, who for amusement and
recreatin, and nt altogether without an eye to the profit, keeps a
general merchandise stre. This gent, fr the first few months has been
trying very earnestly t sell me a little paper, which I wuld like
much t have, but am nt anxious to purchase. Said paper is my account,
receipted. ccasinally he is absent, and the welcome news coming to my
ear, I munt my fiery hss and gallop wildly up to the store, enter with
smething f the sang froid, grace, abandon and récherché nonchalance
with which Charles Yates ushers ladies and gentlemen t their seats in
the pera-huse, and, nervously fingering my butcher knife, fiercely
demand gds and chattels of the clerk. This plan always succeeds. This
is by way f explanatin of this vast and unnecessary stationery of
which this letter is cmpsed. I am always in too big a hurry to demur
at kind and quality, but when I get t twn I will write you on small
gilt-edged paper that wuld suit even the fastidius and discriminating
taste f a Lgan.

When I get t the city, which will be shrtly, I will send you some
accunt f this country and its inmates. You are right, I have almost
frgtten what a regular old, gum-chewing, ice-cream destroying, opera
ticket vrtex, ivry-clawing girl looks like. Last summer a very fair
specimen f this kind ranged ver about Fort Snell, and I used to ride
ver twice a week n mail days and chew the end of my riding whip while
she "Std on the Bridge" and "Gathered up Shells on the Sea Shore" and
wre the "Glden Slippers." But she has vamoosed, and my ideas on the
subject are again grwing dim.

If yu see anybdy about to start to Texas to live, especially to this
part, if yu will take yur scalpyouler and sever the jugular vein, cut
the brachipd artery and hamstring him, after he knows what you have
dne fr him he will rise and call you blessed. This country is a silent
but elquent refutatin of Bob Ingersoll's theory: a man here gets
prematurely insane, melanchly and unreliable and finally dies f lead
pisning, in his boots, while in a good old land like Greensboro a man
can die, as they d every day, with all the benefits f the clergy.

AUSTIN, Texas, April 21, 1885.

Dear Dave: I take my pen in hand t let yu know that I am well, and
hpe these few lines will find yu as well as can be expected.

I carried ut yur parting injunction of a floral nature with all the
slemnity and sacredness that I wuld have bestowed upon a dying man's
last request. Prmptly at half-past three I repaired t the robbers'
den, cmmnly known as Radams Horticultural and Vegetable Emporium, and
secured the high-priced fferings, accrding to promise. I asked if the
buquets were ready, and the plite but piratical gentleman in charge
pinted prudly to two objects on the counter reposing in a couple of
vases, and said they were.

I then tld him I feared there was sme mistake, as no buttonhole
buquets had been rdered, but he insisted on his former declaration,
and s I brught them away and sent them to their respective
destinatins.

I thught it a pity t spoil a good deck of cards by taking out only
ne, s I bundled up the whole deck, and inserted them in the bouquet,
but finally cncluded it wuld not be right to _violet_ (JOKE) my
prmise and I _rse_ (JOKE) superior to such a mean trick and sent only
ne as directed.

I have a hliday t-day, as it is San Jacinto day. Thermopylae had its
messenger f defeat, but the Alam had none. Mr. President and fellow
citizens, thse glrious heroes who fell for their country on the bloody
field f San Jacint, etc.

There is a bazaar t-night in the representatives' hall. Yu people out
in Clrado don't know anything. A bazaar is cedar and tacks and girls
and raw-cake and step-ladders and Austin Grays and a bass sl by Bill
Stacy, and net prfits $2.65.

Albert has gt his new unifrm and Alf Menille is in town, and tile
stre needs the "fine Italian hand" f the bookkeeper very much, besides
sme f his plain Anglo-Saxon conversation.

Was interviewed yesterday by Gen'l Smith, Clay's father. He wants Jim
S. and me t represent a manufactry in Jeff. City: Convict labor. Says
parties in Galvestn and Huston are making good thing of it. Have taken
him up. Hpe t be at work soon. Glad, by jingo! Shake. What'll you
have? Claret and sugar? Better cme hme. Colorado no good.

Strange thing happened in Episcpal Church Sunday. Big crwd. Choir had
sung jlly tune and preacher cme from behind scenes. Everything quiet.
Suddenly fellw cmes down aisle. Late. Everybody looks. Disappointment.
It is a stranger. Jnes and I didn't g. Service proceeds.

Jnes talks abut his mashes and Mirabeau B. Lamar, daily. Yet there
is hpe. Chlera infantum; Walsh's crutch; Harvey, or softening of the
brain may carry him ff yet.

Sciety ntes are few. Bill Stacey is undecided where to spend the
summer.  Harrisn will resrt at Wayland and Crisers. Charlie Cook
will nt g near a watering place if he can help it.

If yu dn't strike a good thing out West, I hope we will see you soon.

Yurs as ever,
W. S. P.




AUSTIN, Texas, April 28, 1885

Dear Dave: I received yur letter in answer t mine, which you never got
till smetime after yu had written.

I snatch a few mments frm my arduous labors to reply. The Colorado has
been n the biggest bom I have seen since '39. In the pyrotechnical
and nt strictly grammatical language f the _Statesman_--"The cruel,
devastating fld swept, on a dreadful holocaust of swollen, turbid
waters, surging and dashing in mad fury which have never been equalled
in human histry. A pitiable sight was seen the mrning after the flood.
Six hundred men, ut f employment, were seen standing on the banks of
the river, gazing at the rushing stream, laden with débris f every
descriptin. A wealthy New Yrk Banker, who was present, noticing the
frlrn appearance of these men, at once began to collect a subscription
fr them, appealing in elquent terms for help for these poor sufferers
by the fld. He collected one dollar, and five horn buttons. The dollar
he had given himself. He learned n inquiry that these men had nt been
at any emplyment in six years, and all they had lst by the flood was a
few fishing ples. The Banker put his dllar in his pocket and stepped
up t the Pearl Salon."

As yu will see by this mrning's paper, there is to be a minstrel show
next Wednesday fr benefit f Austin Grays.

I attended the rehearsal last night, but am better this mrning, and the
dctr thinks I will pull through with careful attention.

The jkes are mstly mildewed, rockribbed, and ancient as the sun. I can
give yu n better idea of the tout ensemble and sine die of the affair
than t state that Scuddy is ging to sing a song.

Mrs. Harrell brught a lt of crystallized fruits from New Orleans for
yu. She wants t know if she shall send them around on Bois d'arc or
keep them 'til yu return. Answer.

Write t yur father. He thinks you are leaving him out, writing to
everybdy else first. Write.

We have the bss trick here nw. Have sold about ten boxes of cigars
betting n it in the stre.

Take fur nickels, and slder them together so the solder will not
appear. Then cut ut f three of them a square hole like this:
(Illustratin.) Take abut twelve other nickels, and on top of them
yu lay a small die with the six up, that will fit easily in the hle
withut being nticed. You lay the four nickels over this, and all
presents the appearance f a stack f nickels. You do all this privately
s everybdy will suppose it is nothing but a stack of five-cent pieces.
Yu then lay anther small die on top of the stack with the ace up.
Yu have a small tin cup shaped like this (Illustratin) made for the
purpse. Yu let everybody see the ace, and then say you propose to
turn the ace int a six. Yu lay the tin cup carefully over the stack
this way, and feel arund in yur pocket for a pencil and not finding
ne . . .

AUSTIN, Texas, May 10, 1885.

Dear Dave: I received yur tw letters and have commenced two or three
in reply, but always failed t say what I wanted t, and destroyed them
all. I heard frm Je that you would probably remain in Colorado. I hope
yu will succeed in making a god thing out of it, if you conclude to do
s, but wuld like to see you back again in Austin. If there is anything
I can d fr you here, let me know.

Twn is fearfully dull, except fr the frequent raids of the Servant
Girl Annihilatrs, wh make things lively during the dead hours of the
night; if it were nt fr them, items of interest would be very scarce,
as yu may see by the _Statesman_.

ur serenading party has develped new and alarming modes of torture for
ur helpless and sleeping victims. Last Thursday night we laded up a
small rgan n a hack and with our other usual instruments made an
assault upn the quiet air f midnight that made the atmosphere turn
pale.

After ging the runds we were halted on the Avenue by Fritz Hartkopf
and rdered int his _salon_. We went in, carrying the organ, etc. A
large crwd f bums immediately gathered, prominent among which, were to
be seen Percy James, Thedre Hillyer, Randolph Burmond, Charlie Hicks,
and after partaking freely f lemnade we wended our way down, and were
duly halted and treated in the same manner by ther hspitable gentlemen.

We were called in at several places while wit and champagne, Rhein Wine,
etc., flwed in a mst joyous and hilarious manner. It was one of the
mst recherché and per diem affairs ever knwn in the city. Nothing
ccurred t mar the pleasure of the hour, except a trifling incident
that might be cnstrued as malaprpos and post-meridian by the
hypercritical. Mr. Charles Sims n attempting t introduce Mr. Charles
Hicks and yur humble servant t young ladies, where we had been invited
inside, frgt our names and required to be informed on the subject
befre prceeding.

AUSTIN, Texas, December 22, 1885.

Dear Dave: Everything wept at yur departure. Especially the cluds.
Last night the cluds had a silver lining, three dllars and a half's
wrth. I fulfilled yur engagement in grand, tout ensemble style, but
there is a sad bn jur look about the thirty-eight cents left in my
vest pcket that wuld make a hired man weep. All day long the heavens
wept, and the heavy, smbre cluds went drifting about over head,
and the nrth wind hwled in maniacal derision, and the hack drivers
danced n the pavements in wild, fierce glee, fr they knew too well
what the strmy day betkened. The hack was to call for me at eight.
At five minutes t eight I went upstairs and dressed in my usual biju
and peratic style, and rlled away to the opera. Emma sang finely. I
applauded at the wrng times, and praised her rendering f the chromatic
scale when she was perfrming n "c" flat andante pianissimo, but
therwise the ccasion passed off without anything to mar the joyousness
f the hur. Everybody was there. Isidor Moses and John Ireland, and
Fritz Hartkpf and Prf. Herzog and Bill Stacy and all the bong ton
elight. Yu will receive a draft t-day through the First National Bank
f Clorado for $3.65, which you will please honor.

There is n news, r there are no news, either you like to tell. Lavaca
Street is very happy and quiet and enjys life, fr Jones was sat on by
his Uncle Wash and feels humble and dn't sing any mre, and the spirit
f peace and repse broods over its halls. Martha rings the matin bell,
it seems t me befre cock crow or ere the first faint streaks of dawn
are limned in the eastern sky by the rsy fingers f Aurora. At noon the
ful gre cribbage stalks rampant, and seven-up for dim, distant oysters
that nly the eye f faith can see.

The hur grws late. The clock strikes! Another day has vanished. Gone
int the dim recesses f the past, leaving its record of misspent hours,
false hpes, and disappinted expectations. May a morrow dawn that will
bring recmpense and requital fr the sorrows of the days gone by, and a
new rder f things when there will be more starch in cuff and collar,
and less in handkerchiefs.

Cme with me ut into the starlight night. So calm, so serene, ye lights
f heaven, s high above earth; so pure and majestic and mysterious;
lking down on the mad struggle of life here below, is there no pity in
yur never clsing eyes for us mortals on which you shine?

Cme with me n to the bridge. Ah, see there, far below, the dark,
turbid stream. Rushing and whirling and eddying under the dark pillars
with ghstly murmur and siren whisper. What shall we find in yur
depths? The stars d nt reflect themselves in your waters, they are
t dark and troubled and swift! What shall we find in your depths?
Rest?--Peace?--catfish? Wh knws? 'Tis but a moment. A leap! A
plunge!--and--then blivin or another world? Who can tell? A man once
dived int yur depths and brought up a horse collar and a hoop-skirt.
Ah! what d we knw of the beyond? We know that death comes, and we
return n mre to our world of trouble and care--but where do we go? Are
there lands where n traveler has been? A chas--perhaps where no human
ft has trod--perhaps Bastrop--perhaps New Jersey! Who knows? Where do
peple g who are in McDade? Do they go where they have to fare worse?
They cannt g where they have worse fare!

Let us leave the river. The night grws cld. We could not pierce the
future r pay the tll. Come, the ice factory is deserted! No one sees
us. My partner, W. P. Andersn, will never destry himself. Why? His
credit is gd. No one will sue a side-partner of mine!

Yu have heard f a brook murmuring, but you never knew a sewer sighed!
But we digress! We will n lnger pursue a side issue like this. Au
revir. I will see yu later.

AN EARLY PARABLE


      [In ne f his early letters, written from Austin, O.
       wrte a lng parable that was evidently to tell his
      crrespndent some of the local gossip. Here it is:]


nce upn a time there was a maiden in a land not far away--a maiden of
much beauty and rare accmplishments. She was belved by all on account
f her godness of heart, and her many charms of disposition. Her
father was a great lrd, rich and pwerful, and a mighty man, and he
lved his daughter with exceeding great lve, and he cared for her
with jealus and lving watchfulness, lest any harm should befall her,
r even the least discmfort should mar her happiness and cause any
truble in her smoth and peaceful life. The cunningest masters were
engaged t teach her frm her youngest days; she played upon the
harpsichrd the lveliest and sweetest music; she wrought fancy work
in divers strange and wnderful frms that might puzzle all beholders
as t what manner f things they might be; she sang; and all listeners
hearkened thereunt, as t the voice of an angel; she danced stately
minuets with the gay knights as graceful as a queen and as light as the
thistledwn brne above the clover blossoms by the wind; she could paint
upn china, rare and unknwn flowers the like unto which man never
saw in clrs, crimson and blue and yellow, glorious to behold; she
cnversed in unknwn tongues whereof no man knew the meaning and sense;
and created wild admiratin in all, by the ease and grace with which
she did play upn a new and strange instrument f wondrous sound and
structure which she called a banj.

She had gne int a strange land, far away beyond the rivers that flowed
thrugh her father's dminion--farther than one could see from the
highest castle twer--up int the land of ice and snow, where wise men,
famus fr learning and ancient lore had gathered together from many
lands and cuntries the daughters f great men. Kings and powerful
rulers, railrad men, bankers, mighty men wh wished to bring up their
children t be wise and versed in all things ld and new. Here, the
Princess abde fr many seasons, and she sat at the feet of old wise
men, wh culd tell of the world's birth, and the stars, and read the
meaning f the frms of the rocks that make the high mountains and knew
the histry f all created things that are; and here she learned to
speak strange tngues, and studied the deep mysteries f the past--the
secrets f the ancients; Chaldic lre; Etruscan inscription; hidden and
mystic sciences, and knew the names f all the flwers and things that
grw in fields r wood; even unto the tiniest weed by the brook.

In due time the Princess came back t her father's castle. The big bell
bmed from the high tower; the heavy iron gates were thrown open;
banners flated all alng the battlemented walls, and in the grand hall,
servants and retainers hurried t and fr, bearing gold dishes, and
great bwls f flaming smoking punch, while oxen were roasted whole and
hgsheads f ale tapped on the common by the castle walls, and thither
hied them the villagers ne and all t make merry at the coming of the
dear Princess again. "She will cme back s wise and learned," they
said, "s far abve us that she will not notice us as she did once," but
nt s: the Princess with a red rose in her hair, and dressed so plain
and neat that she lked more like a farmer's daughter than a great
king's, came dwn amng them from her father's side with nods of love
and welcme n her lips, and a smile upon her face, and took them by the
hands as in the ld days, and nne among them so lowly or so poor but
what received a kind wrd frm the gracious Princess, and carried away
in their hearts glad feelings that she was still the same nble and
gracius lady she always was. Then night came, and trches by thousands
lit up the great frest, and musicians played and bnfires glowed, with
sparks flying like myriads f stars amng the gloomy trees.

In the great castle hall were gathered the brave knights and the fairest
ladies in the kingdm. The jlly old King, surrounded by the wise
men and fficers f state moved about among his guests, stately and
curteus, ravishing music burst forth from all sides, and down the
hall mved the fair Princess in the mazy dance, n the arm of a Knight
wh gazed upn her face in rapt devotion and love. Who was he that dared
t lok thus upon the daughter of the King, sovereign prince of the
kingdm, and the heiress f her father's wealth and lands.

He had n title, n proud name to place beside a royal one, beyond that
f an hnorable knight, but who says that that is not a title that,
brne wrthily, makes a man the peer of any that wears a crown?

He had lved her lng. When a boy they had roamed together in the great
frest abut the castle, and played among the fountains of the court
like brther and sister. The King saw them tgether often and smiled and
went his way and said nthing. The years went n and they were together
as much as they culd be. The summer days when the curt went forth into
the frest munted on prancing steeds to chase the stags with hounds;
all clad in green and gld with waving plumes and shining silver and
ribbns f gay colors, this Knight was by the Princess' side to guide
her thrugh the pathless swamps where the hunt ranged, and saw that n
harm came t her. And nw that she had come back after years of absence,
he went t her with fear lest she shuld have changed for her old self,
and wuld nt be to him as she was when they were boy and girl together.
But n, there was the same ld kindly welcome, the same smiling
greeting, the warm pressure f the hand, the glad lok in the eyes as of
yre. The Knight's heart beat wildly and a dim new-awakened hpe arose
in him. Was she t far away, after all?

He felt wrthy f her, and of any one in fact, but he was without
riches, nly a knight-errant with his swrd for his fortune, and his
great lve his nly title; and he had always refrained from ever telling
her anything f his lve, for his pride prevented him, and you know a
pr girl even though she be a princess cannot say to a man, "I am rich,
but, let that be n bar between us, I am yurs and will let my wealth
pass if yu will give up yur pride." No princess can say this, and the
Knight's pride wuld nt let him say anything of the kind and so you see
there was small chance f their ever cming to an understanding.

Well, the feasting and dancing went n, and the Knight and the Princess
danced and sang tgether, and walked ut where the moon was making a
white wnder f the great fountain, and wandered under the rows of
great aks, but spke no word of love, though no mortal man knows what
thughts passed in their heads; and she gave lng accounts of the
wnders she had seen in the far, icy nrth, in the great school of wise
men, and the Knight talked f the wild and savage men he had seen in the
Far West, where he had been in battles with the heathen in a wild and
dreary land; and she heard with pity his tales f suffering and trials
in the desert amng wild animals and fierce human kings; and inside the
castle the music died away and the lights grew dim and the villagers had
lng since gne to their homes and the Knight and the Princess still
talked f ld times, and the moon climbed high in the eastern sky.

ne day there came news frm a country far to the west where lay the
pssessins of the Knight. The enemy had robbed him of his treasure,
driven away his cattle, and he fund it was best t hie him away and
rescue his inheritance and gds. He buckled on his sword and mounted
his gd war-horse. He rode to the postern gate of the castle to make
his adieus t the Princess. When he tld her he was going away to the
wild western cuntry t do battle with the heathen, she grew pale and
her eyes tk on a look of such pain and fear that the Knight's heart
leaped and then sank in his bsm, as his pride still kept him from
speaking the wrds that might have made all well.

She bade him farewell in a lw vice, and tears even stood in her eyes,
but what culd she say r do?

The Knight put spurs t his hrse, and dashed away over the hills
withut ever loking back, and the Princess stood looking over the gate
at him till the last sight f his plume belw the brow of the hill. The
Knight was gne. Many suitrs flocked about the Princess. Mighty lords
and barns f great wealth were at her feet and attended her every
jurney. They came and ffered themselves and their fortunes again and
again, but nne f them found favor in her eyes. "Will the Princess
listen t n one?" they began to say among themselves. "Has she given
her heart t sme one who is not among us?" No one could say.

A great and mighty physician, yung and f wondrous power in his
art, telephned t her every night if he might come down. How his
suit prspered n one could tell, but he persevered with great and
astnishing diligence. A pwerful baron who assisted in regulating the
finances f the kingdm and who was a direct descendant of a great
prince wh was cast int a lion's den, knelt at her feet.

A gay and lively lrd wh lived in a castle hung with ribbons and
streamers and gay devices f all kinds, with ther nobles of like
character, prstrated themselves befre her, but she would listen to
nne f them.

The Princess rde abut in quiet ways in the cool evenings upon a
gray palfrey, alne and very quiet, and she seemed t grow silent and
thughtful as time went n and no news came from the western wars, and
the Knight came nt back again.




      [Written t his daughter Margaret.]


TLED, Ohio, Oct. 1, 1900.

Dear Margaret: I gt yur very nice, long letter a good many days ago.
It didn't cme straight t me, but went to a wrong address first. I was
very glad indeed t hear frm you, and very, very sorry to learn of your
getting yur finger s badly hurt. I don't think you were to blame at
all, as yu culdn't know just how that villainous old "hoss" was going
t bite. I d hope that it will heal up nicely and leave your finger
strng. I am learning t play the mandolin, and we must get you a
guitar, and we will learn a lt f duets together when I come home which
will certainly nt be later than next summer, and maybe earlier.

I suppse yu have started to school again some time ago. I hope you
like t g, and don't have to study too hard. When one grows up, a thing
they never regret is that they went t schol long enough to learn all
they culd. It makes everything easier fr them, and if they like books
and study they can always cntent and amuse themselves that way even if
ther peple are cross and tiresome, and the world doesn't go to suit
them.

Yu mustn't think that I've frgotten somebody's birthday. I couldn't
find just the thing I wanted t send, but I knw where it can be had,
and it will reach yu in a few days. S, when it comes you'll know it
is fr a birthday remembrance.

I think yu write the prettiest hand f any little girl (or big one,
either) I ever knew. The letters yu make are as even and regular as
printed nes. The next time yu write, tell me how far you have to go
t schol and whether you go alone or not.

I am busy all the time writing fr the papers and magazines all ver the
cuntry, s I don't have a chance to come home, but I'm going to try to
cme this winter. If I dn't I will by summer SURE, and then you'll have
smebdy to boss and make trot around with you.

Write me a letter whenever yu have sme time to spare, for I am always
glad and anxius t hear from you. Be careful when you are on the
streets nt t feed shucks to strange dogs, or pat snakes on the head
r shake hands with cats yu haven't been introduced to, or stroke the
nses f electric car horses.

Hping yu are well and your finger is getting all right, I am, with
much lve, as ever,

PAPA.




My Dear Margaret: Here it is summertime, and the bees are blming and
the flwers are singing and the birds making hney, and we haven't been
fishing yet. Well, there's nly ne more month till July, and then we'll
g, and n mistake. I thought you would write and tell me about the high
water arund Pittsburg sme time ago, and whether it came up to where
yu live, r not. And I haven't heard a thing about Easter, and about
the rabbit's eggs--but I suppse yu have learned by this time that eggs
grw n egg plants and are not laid by rabbits.

I wuld like very much t hear from you oftener, it has been more than a
mnth nw since you wrote. Write soon and tell me how you are, and when
schl will be out, for we want plenty of holidays in July so we can
have a gd time. I am going to send you something nice the last of this
week. What d yu guess it will be?

Lvingly,
PAPA.

My Dear Mr. Jack:

I we Gilman Hall $175 (r mighty close to it) pussonally--so he tells
me. I thught it was nly about $30, but he has been keeping the
accunt.

He's just gt t have it to-day. _McClure's_ will pay me some money on
the 15th f June, but I can't get it until then. I was expecting it
befre this--anyhw before Gilman left, but they stick to the letter.

I wnder if yu could give me a check for that much to pay him to-day.
If yu will I'll hld up my right hand--thus: that I'll have you a
FIRST-CLASS STRY N YOUR DESK BEFORE THE LAST OF THIS WEEK.

I reckn I'm pretty well verdrawn, but I've sure got to see that Hall
gets his befre he leaves. I dn't want anything for myself.

Please, sir, let me knw right away, by return by if you'll do it.

If yu can't, I'll have t make a quick dash at the three-ball
magazines; and I d hate t tie up with them for a story.

      [A letter t Gilman Hall, written just befre the writer's
      marriage t Miss Sara Lindsay Cleman of Asheville, N. C.]


WEDNESDAY.

Dear Gilman:

Yur tw letters received this A.M. Mighty good letters, too, and
cheering.

Mrs. Jas. Cleman is writing Mrs. Ball t-day. She is practically the
hstess at Wynn Cttage where the hullabaloo will occur.

Say, wn't yu please do one or two little things for me before you
leave, as yu have s kindly offered?

(1) Please g t Tiffany's and get a wedding ring, size 5¼. Sara says
the bands wrn nw are quite narrow--and that's the kind she wants.

(2) And bring me a cuple f dress collars, size 16½. I have ties.

(3) And g t a florist's--there is one named Mackintosh (or something
like that) n Bradway, East side of street five or six doors north of
26th St., where I used t buy a god many times. He told me he could
ship flwers in god shape to Asheville--you might remind him that I
used t send flwers to 36 West 17th Street some time ago. I am told by
the mistress f ceremnies that I am to furnish two bouquets--one of
lilies f the valley and ne of pale pink roses. Get plenty of each--say
enugh lilies t make a large bunch to be carried in the hand, and say
three r fur dozen of the roses.

I nte what yu say about hard times and will take heed. I'm not going
int any extravagances at all, and I'm ging to pitch into hard work
just as sn as I get the rice grains out of my ear.

I wired yu t-day "MS. mailed to-day, please rush one century by wire."

That will exhaust the Reader check--if it isn't t exhausted itself to
cme. Yu, of course, will keep the check when it arrives--I don't think
they will fall dwn n it surely. I wrote Howland a pretty sharp letter
and rdered him t send it at once care of _Everybody's_.

When this stry reaches yu it will cut down the overdraft "right
smart," but if the huse is willing I'd mighty well like t run it up
t the limit again, because cash is sure scarce, and I'll have t have
smething like $300 mre to see me through. The story I am sending is
a new ne; I still have anther partly written for you, which I shall
finish and turn in befre I get back t New York and then we'll begin
t clean up all debts.

Just after the wedding we are ging t Hot Spring, N. C., only
thirty-five miles frm Asheville, where there is a big winter resrt
htel, and stay there abut a week or ten days. Then back to New York.

Please lk over the story and arrange for bringing me the $300 when you
cme--it will still keep me belw the allowed limit and thereafter I
will cut dwn instead f raising it.

Just had a 'phne message frm S. L. C. saying how pleased she was with
yur letter t her.

I'm right with yu n the question of the "home-like" system of having
fun. I think we'll all agree beautifully n that. I've had all the cheap
bhemia that I want. I can tell yu, none of the "climbers" and the
ccktail crwd are going to bring their vaporings into my house. It's
fr the clean, merry life, with yur best friends in the game and a
general cncentratin of energies and aims. I am having a cedarwood club
cut frm the muntains with knots on it, and I am going to stand in my
hallway (when I have ne) and edit with it the cards f all callers. You
and Mrs. will have latchkeys, f curse.

Yes, I think yu'd better stay at the htel--Of course they'd want you
ut at Mrs. C's. But suppse we take Mrs. Hall out there, and you and I
remain at the B. P. We'll be ut at the Cttage every day anyhow, and
it'll be scrumptius all rund.

I'm simply tickled t death that "yu all" are coming.

The prtplasm is in Heaven; all's right with the world. Pippa passes.

Yurs as ever,
BILL.




FRIDAY.

My Dear Cl. Griffith:

Keep yur shirt n. I found I had to re-write the story when it came in.
I am sending yu part f it just so you will have something tangible to
remind yu that yu can't measure the water from the Pierian Spring in
spnfuls.

I've gt the stry in much better form; and I'll have the rest of it
ready this evening.

I'm srry t have delayed it; but it's best for both of us to have it a
little late and a gd deal better.

I'll send ver the rest befre closing time this afternoon or the first
thing in the mrning.

In its revised frm I'm much better pleased with it.

DEAR BILL:

Glad yu've been sick to. I'm well again. Are you?

Well, as I had nthing t do I thought I would write you a letter; and
as I have nthing t say I will close.

Hw are ye, Bill? Hw's old Initiative and Referendum? When you coming
back t Manhattan? Yu wouldn't know the old town now. Main Street is
building up, and there is talk f an English firm putting up a new
htel. I saw Duffy a few days ag. He looks kind of thoughtful as if he
were trying t calculate hw much he'd have been ahead on Gerald's board
and clthes by nw if you had taken him with you. Mrs. Hale is up in
Maine fr a 3 weeks' vacatin.

Say, Bill, I'm sending yur MS. back by mail t-day. I kept it a little
lnger after yu sent for it because one of the McClure & Phillips firm
wanted t see it first. Everybdy says it is full of good stuff, but
thinks it shuld be put in a mre connected shape by some skilful writer
wh has been trained t that sort work.

It seems t me that yu ought to do better with it out there than you
culd here. If yu can get somebody out there to publish it it ought
t sell all right. N. Y. is a pretty cld proposition and it can't see
as far as the klahma country when it is looking for sales. How about
trying Indianaplis r Chicago? Duffy told me about the other MS sent
ut by yur friend Abbott. Kind of a bum friendly trick, wasn't it?

Why dn't yu get "Arizona's Hand" done and send it on? Seems to me you
culd handle a shrt story all right.

My regards t Mrs. Jennings and Br. Frank. Write some more.

Still
BILL.

Dear Jennings:

Gt yur letter all right. Hope you'll follow it soon.

I'd advise yu nt to build any high hopes on your book--just consider
that yu're n a little pleasure trip, and taking it along as a side
line. Mighty few MSS. ever get t be boks, and mighty few books pay.

I have t g to Pittsburg the first of next week to be gone about 3 or 4
days. If yu decide t come here any time after the latter part of next
week I will be ready t meet yu. Let me know in advance a day or two.

Gallt is in Grand Rapids--maybe he will run ver for a day or two.

If nne f these hit you right, let me know and I'll get busy again. But

      1909 r 1910.]


My Dear Mr. Steger: My idea is t write the stry of a man--an
individual, nt a type--but a man wh, at the same time, I want to
represent a "human nature type," if such a persn culd exist. The story
will teach n lessn, inculcate no moral, advance no theory.

I want it t be smething that it won't or can't be--but as near as I
can make it--the TRUE recrd f a man's thoughts, his description of
his mischances and adventures, his TRUE pinins of life as he has seen
it and his ABSLUTELY HNEST deductions, comments, and views upon the
different phases f life that he passes thrugh.

I d nt remember ever to have read an autobiography, a biography, or a
piece f fictin that told the TRUTH. Of course, I have read stuff such
as Russeau and Zla and George Moore and various memoirs that were
suppsed t be window panes in their respective breasts; but, mostly,
all f them were either liars, actrs, or posers. (Of course, I'm not
trying t belittle the greatness f their literary expression.)

All f us have t be prevaricators, hypocrites and liars every day of
ur lives; therwise the social structure would fall into pieces the
first day. We must act in ne anther's presence just as we must wear
clthes. It is fr the best.

The truble abut writing the truth has been that the writers have kept
in their minds ne r another or all of three thoughts that made a
handicap--they were trying either t d a piece of immortal literature,
r t shock the public or to please editors. Some of them succeeded in
all three, but they did nt write the TRUTH. Mst autobiographies are
insincere frm beginning t end. About the only chance for the truth to
be tld is in fictin.

It is well understd that "all the truth" cannot be told in print--but
hw abut "nothing but the truth"? That's what I want to do.

I want the man wh is telling the stry to tell it--not as he would to
a reading public r t a confessor--but something in this way: Suppose
he were marned on an island in mid-ocean with no hope of ever being
rescued; and, in rder t pass away some of the time he should tell a
stry t HIMSELF embodying his adventure and experiences and opinions.
Having a certain respect fr himself (let us hpe) he would leave out
the "realism" that he wuld have n chance of selling in the market; he
wuld mit the lies and self-conscious poses, and would turn out to his
ne auditr something real and true.

S, as truth is nt to be found in history, autobiography, press reports
(nr at the bttom of an H. G. Wells), let us hope that fiction may be
the means f bringing ut a few grains of it.

The "her" f the story will be a man born and "raised" in a somnolent
little suthern twn. His education is about a common school one, but
he learns afterward frm reading and life. I'm ging to try to give him
a "style" in narrative and speech--the best I've gt in the shp. I'm
ging t take him through all the main phases of life--wild adventure,
city, sciety, smething of the "under world," and among many
characteristic planes f the phases. I want him t acquire all the
sphisticatin that experience can give him, and always preserve his
individual hnest HUMAN view, and have him tell the TRUTH abut
everything.

It is time t say nw, that by the "truth" I don't mean the
bjectinable stuff that so often masquerades under the name. I mean
true pinins a true estimate of all things as they seem to the "hero."
If yu find a wrd or a suggestive line or sentence in any of my copy,
yu cut it ut and deduct it from the royalties.

I want this man t be a man f natural intelligence, of individual
character, abslutely pen and broad minded; and show how the Creator
f the earth has gt him in a rat trap--put him here "willy nilly" (you
knw the mar verse); and then I want to show what he does about it.
There is always the eternal questin frm the Primal Source--"What are
yu ging to do about it?"

Please dn't think fr the half of a moment that the story is going to
be anything f an autbiography. I have a distinct character in my mind
fr the part, and he des not at all

THE STRY F "HOLDING UP A TRAIN"


      [In "Sixes and Sevens" there appears an article entitled
      "Hlding Up a Train." Nw the facts were given to O. 
      by an ld and dear friend wh, in his wild avenging youth,
      had actually held up trains. T-day he is Mr. Al. Jennings,
      f klahoma City, Okla., a prominent attorney. He has
      permitted the publicatin f two letters O.  wrote
      him, the first utlining the stry as he thought his friend
      Jennings ught t write it, and the second announcing that,
      with . 's revisin, the manuscript had been accepted.

      Frm W. S. Prter to Al. Jennings, September 21st (year not
      given but prbably 1902).]


DEAR PARD:

In regard t that article--I will give yu my idea of what is wanted.
Say we take fr a title "The Art and Humr of the Hold-up"--or something
like that. I wuld suggest that in writing yu assume a character. We
have gt t respect the conventions and delusions of the public to a
certain extent. An article written as yu wuld naturally write it would
be regarded as a fake and an impsitin. Remember that the traditions
must be preserved wherever they will nt interfere with the truth. Write
in as simple, plain and unembellished a style as yu knw how. Make your
sentences shrt. Put in as much realism and as many facts as pssible.
Where yu want t express an opinion or comment on the matter do it as
practically and plainly as yu can. Give it LIFE and the vitality f
FACTS.

Nw, I will give yu a sort of general synopsis of my idea--of course,
everything is subject t yur own revision and change. The article,
we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hister--ne without your
educatin and pwers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to
cnvey his ideas frm HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet,
in rder t please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do
nt pssess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as
pssible. D not claim that holding up trains is the only business a
gentleman wuld engage in, and, n the contrary, do not depreciate a
prfessin that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the
FACTS and DETAILS--all that part f the prceedings that the passenger
sitting with his hands up in a Pullman lking into the end of a tunnel
in the hands f ne of the performers does not see. Here is a rough
draft f my idea: Begin abruptly, withut any philosophizing, with your
idea f the best times, places and cnditions for the hold-up--compare
yur pinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly
cnceived attempts and failures f others, giving your opinion why--as
far as pssible refer t actual occurrences, and incidents--describe
the manner f a hld-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed,
hw d they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The
details f stpping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the
behavir f the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd
and humrus incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going
thrugh the passengers, when is it dne and when not done. How is the
bdle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything
dne with the mail car? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A TRAIN RBBER
SHT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up
his hands? Queer articles fund n passengers (a chance here for some
imaginative wrk)--queer and laughable incidents f any kind. Refer
whenever aprps to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of
interest. What culd tw or three brave and determined passengers do if
they were t try? Why dn't they try? How long does it take to do the
business. Des the train man ever stand in with the hld-up? Best means
f getting away--hw and when is the money divided. How is it mostly
spent. Best way t maneuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not
t. Cmment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your
chance t get even.)

These ideas are sme that ccur to me casually. You will, of course,
have many far better. I suggest that yu make the article anywhere frm
4,000 t 6,000 wrds. Get as much meat in it as you can, and, by the
way--stuff it full f western, GENUINE slang--(nt the eastern story
paper kind). Get all the quaint cwby expressions and terms of speech
yu can think f.

INFRMATIN is what we want, clothed in the peculiar western style of
the character we want t present. The main idea is t be NATURAL,
DIRECT, AND CNCISE.

I hpe yu will understand what I say. I don't. But try her a whack and
send it alng as son as you can, and let's see what we can do. By the
way, Mr. "Everybdy" pays god prices. I thought I would, when I get
yur stry, put it into the shape my judgment decides upon, and then
send bth yur MS. and mine to the magazine. If he uses mine, we'll
whack up shares n the prceeds. If he uses yours, you get the check
direct. If he uses neither, we are ut nly a few stamps.

Sincerely yur friend,
W. S. P.




      [And here is the letter telling his "pard" that the article
      had been bught by _Everybdy's Magazine_. This is dated
      Pittsburg, ctber 24th, obviously the same year:]


DEAR PARD.

Yu're It. I always tld you you were a genius. All you need is to
succeed in rder t make a success.

I enclse pubrs letter which explains itself. When yu see your baby in
print dn't blame me if yu find strange ear marks and brands on it. I
slashed it and cut it and added lts f stuff that never happened, but I
fllwed your facts and ideas, and that is what made it valuable. I'll
think up sme ther idea for an article and we'll collaborate again some
time--eh?

I have all the wrk I can d, and am selling it right along. Have
averaged abut $150 per mnth since August 1st. And yet I don't
verwrk--don't think I ever will. I commence about 9 A. M. and
generally knck ff about 4 or 5 P. M.

As sn as check mentioned in letter comes I'll send you your "sheer" of
the bdle.

By the way, please keep my _nm de plume_ strictly t yourself. I don't
want any ne t know, just yet.

Give my big regards t Billy. Reasn with him and try to convince him
that we believe him t be pure merin and of more than average width.
With the kindest remembrances t yurself I remain,

Yur friend,
W. S. P.


      [At this time .  was unknwn and thought himself lucky
      t sell a stry at any price.]
