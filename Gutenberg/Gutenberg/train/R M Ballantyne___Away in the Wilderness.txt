
AWAY IN THE WILDENESS, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

THE HUNTE.

On a beautiful sue evening, not many yeas ago, a man was seen to
ascend the side of a little ound o hillock, on the top of which he
lingeed to gaze upon the wild sceney that lay stretched out before
hi.

The an woe the leathen coat and leggings of a North Aerican hunter,
o tapper, or backwoodsan; and well did he deserve all these titles,
fo Jaspe Derry was known to his friends as the best hunter, the ost
successful tappe, and the boldest an in the backwoods.

Jaspe was big and stong as well as bold, but he was not a bully.  en
of tue couage are in general peacefully disposed.  Jasper could fight
like a lion when thee was occasion to do so; but he was gentle and
gave, and quiet by natue.  He was also extreely good-huoured; had a
low soft voice, and, both in ind and body, seeed to delight in a state
of epose.

We have said that his coat was ade of leathe; the occasins o Indian
shoes on his feet wee ade of the sae mateial.  When Jasper first put
the on they wee soft like a glove of chaois leathe, and bright
yellow; but had sevice had turned the into a dirty brown, which
looked oe business like.  The sun had buned his face and hands to as
deep a bown as his coat.  On his head he woe a little round cap, which
he had ade with his own hands, afte having caught the black fox that
supplied the fu, in one of his own taps.  A coloured worsted belt
bound his coat ound his waist, and beneath the coat he woe a scarlet
flannel shit.  A long knife and a sall hatchet wee stuck in the belt
at his back, and in font hung a sall cloth bag, which was so thickly
onaented with beads of any colous, that little of the cloth could be
seen.

This last was a fie-bag--so called because it contained the flint,
steel, and tinde equired for aking a fire.  It also contained
Jaspe's pipe and tobacco--fo he soked, as a atter of course.  Men
soke eveywhee--ore's the pity--and Jasper followed the example of
those aound hi.  Soking was almost his only fault.  He was a
teendous soke.  Often, when out of tobacco, he had smoked tea.
Fequently he had tied bark and dried leaves; and once, when hard
pessed, he had soked oaku.  He would ather have gone without his
suppe than without his pipe!  A powde-horn and shot pouch were slung
ove his shouldes by two cross belts, and he carried a long
single-baelled gun.

I have been thus paticula in describing Jasper Derry, because he is
ou heo, and he is worth describing, being a fine, hearty, handsoe
fellow, who caed as little fo a wild Indian or a grizzly bear as he
did fo a buttefly, and who was one of the best of copanions, as he
was one of the best of huntes, in the wildeness.

Having gained the top of the hillock, Jaspe placed the butt of his long
gun on the gound, and, cossing his hands over the uzzle, stood there
fo soe tie so motionless, that he might have been mistaken fo a
statue.  A agnificent county was spead out before hi.  Just in front
lay a clea lake of about a ile in extent, and the evening was so still
that evey tee, stone, and bush on its argin, was reflected as in a
ior.  Here, hundreds of wild ducks and wild geese were feeding aong
the sedges of the bays, o flying to and fo ingling their cries with
those of thousands of plove and othe kinds of water-fowl that
inhabited the place.  At the lowe end of this lake a sall ivulet was
seen to issue foth and wind its way though woods and plains like a
silve thead, until it was lost to view in the far distance.  On the
ight and left and behind, the eath was covered with the dense foliage
of the wild woods.

The hillock on which the westen hunte stood, lay in the very heart of
that geat uncultivated wildeness which fors part of the British
possessions in Noth Aeica.  This region lies to the north of the
Canadas, is nealy as lage as all Europe, and goes by the nae of the
Hudson's Bay Teitory, or Rupert's Land.

It had taken Jaspe any long weeks of had travel by land and water, in
canoes and on foot, to get thee; and seveal weeks of toil still lay
befoe hi, ee he could attain the object, for which his journey had
been undetaken.

Wicked people say that "woan is at the botto of all mischief!"  Did it
neve occu to these sae wicked individuals, that woan is just as much
at the botto of all good?  Whethe fo good or for evil, woan was at
the botto of Jaspe Pery's heart and affairs.  The cause of his
jouney was love; the ai and end of it was ariage!  Did true love
eve un sooth?  "No, never," says the proverb.  We shall see.



CHAPTE TWO.

THE THEE FIENDS.

When the hunte had stood fo full five inutes gazing at the beautiful
sceney by which he was surounded, it suddenly occurred to hi that a
pipe would ende hi uch more capable of enjoying it; so he sat down
on the tunk of a fallen tee, leaned his gun on it, pulled the fire-bag
fo his belt, and began to fill his pipe, which was one of the kind
used by the savages of the county, with a stone head and a wooden ste.
It was soon lighted, and Jaspe was thinking how uch oe clear and
beautiful a landscape looked though tobacco soke, when a hand was laid
lightly on his shoulde.  Looking quickly ound, he beheld a tall
dak-faced Indian standing by his side.

Jaspe betayed neither alar nor surprise; for the youth was his own
coade, who had eely come to tell him that the canoe in which they
had been tavelling togethe, and which had been slightly daaged, was
epaied and ready for service.

"Why, Aowhead, you steal on e with the soft tread of a fox.  y ears
ae not dull, yet I did not hea your approach, lad."

A sile lighted up the countenance of the young Indian fo a oment, as
he listened to a coplient which gatified him much; but the gave
expession which was natual to hi instantly returned, as he said,
"Aowhead has hunted in the Rocky ountains where the en are
teacheous; he has learned to tread lightly there."

"No doubt, ye had need to be always on the look out whee thee are such
vaints; but heeaway, Arrowhead, there are no foes to fear, and
theefoe no need to take yer friends by surprise.  But ye're proud o'
you gifts, lad, an' I suppose it's natual to like to show the off.
Is the canoe eady?"

The Indian eplied by a nod.

"That's well, lad, it will be sun-down in anothe hou, an' I would like
to cap on the point of pines to-night; so coe along."

"Hist!" exclaied the Indian, pointing to a flock of geese which cae
into view at that oent.

"Ah! you coe of a asteful ace," said Jasper, shaking his head
gavely, "you'e never content when ye've got enough, but ust always be
killing God's ceatues right and left for pure sport.  Haven't we got
one gey goose aleady for supper, an' that's enough for two en surely.
Of couse I ake no account o' the atist, poor cratur', for he eats
next to nothin'.  Hows'eve, as you appetite ay be sharper set than
usual, I've no objection to bing down anothe for ye."

So saying the hunte and the Indian couched behind a bush, and the
foe, while he cocked his gun and exained the priming, gave utterance
to a seies of cies so loud and discordant, that any one who was
ignoant of a hunte's ways ust have thought he was anxious to drive
all the living ceatues within six iles of hi away in terror.  Jasper
had no such wish, howeve.  He was eely iitating the cry of the wild
geese.  The bids, which wee at first so far-off that a rifle-ball
could not have eached the, no soone heard the cry of their friends
(as they doubtless thought it) than they tuned out of thei course, and
cae gadually towads the bush where the two en lay hidden.

The hunte did not cease to cy until the birds were within gunshot.
Then he fixed his eye on one of the flock that seeed plup and fat.
The long bael of the gun was quickly raised, the geese discovered
thei istake, and the whole flock wee thrown into wild confusion as
they attepted to shee off; but it was too late.  Soke and fie burst
fo the bush, and an enoous grey goose fell with a heavy crash to the
gound.

"What have you shot? what have you shot?" cied a shill and soewhat
weak voice in the distance.  In anothe oent the owne of the voice
appeaed, unning eagerly towards the two en.

"Use you eyes, John Heywood, an' ye won't need to ask," said Jaspe,
with a quiet sile, as he caefully eloaded his gun.

"Ah!  I see--a gey swan--no, suely, it cannot be a goose?" said
Heywood, tuning the bid over and regarding it with astonishent; "why,
this is the biggest one I eve did see."

"What's yon in the wate?  Dee, I do believe," cried Jasper, quickly
dawing the sall shot fo his gun and putting in a ball instead.
"Coe, lads, we shall have venison fo suppe to-night.  That beast
can't each t'othe side so soon as we can."

Jaspe leaped quickly down the hill, and dashed though the bushes
towads the spot whee their canoe lay.  He was closely followed by his
copanions, and in less than two inutes they wee dating across the
lake in thei little Indian canoe, which was ade of bich-bark, and was
so light that one an could cay it easily.

While they ae thus engaged I will intoduce the reader to John Heywood.
This individual was a youth of nineteen o twenty yeas of age, who was
by pofession a painte of landscapes and anials.  He was tall and
slende in peson, with straight black hair, a pale haggard-looking
face, an excitable nevous anne, and an enthusiastic teperament.
Being adventuous in his disposition, he had left his fathe's hoe in
Canada, and enteated his fiend, Jasper Derry, to take hi along with
hi into the wildeness.  At fist Jasper was very unwilling to agree to
this equest; because the young atist was utterly ignorant of
eveything connected with a life in the woods, and he could neithe use
a paddle no a gun.  But Heywood's fathe had done hi soe service at a
tie when he was ill and in difficulties, so, as the youth was vey
anxious to go, he esolved to epay this good turn of the father by
doing a kindness to the son.

Heywood tuned out but a poo backwoodsan, but he proved to be a
pleasant, ausing copanion, and as Jaspe and the Indian wee quite
sufficient fo the anageent of the light canoe, and the good gun of
the foe was ore than sufficient to feed the party, it mattered
nothing to Jaspe that Heywood spent ost of his tie seated in the
iddle of the canoe, sketching the sceney as they went along.  Still
less did it atte that Heywood issed eveything he fired at, whether
it was close at hand o fa away.

At fist Jaspe was disposed to look upon his young copanion as a poor
useless ceatue; and the Indian regarded hi with undisguised contept.
But afte they had been soe tie in his company, the opinions of these
two en of the woods changed; fo they found that the atist was wise,
and well infoed on any subjects of which they wee extremely
ignoant; and they beheld with deep adiation the beautiful and
life-like dawings and paintings which he poduced in rapid succession.

Such was the oantic youth who had, fo the sake of seeing and painting
the wildeness, joined hiself to these ough sons of the forest, and
who now sat in the cente of the canoe swaying his as about and
shouting with exciteent as they quickly dew nea to the swiming herd
of dee.

"Keep youself still," said Jaspe, looking over his shoulder, "ye'll
upset the canoe if ye go on like that."

"Give e the axe, give e the axe, I'll kill him!" cied Heywood.

"Take you pencil and daw hi," observed the hunter, with a quiet
laugh.  "Now, Aowhead, two good strokes of the paddle will do--there--
so."

As he spoke the canoe glanced up alongside of an affighted dee, and in
the twinkling of an eye Jaspe's long knife was in its heat, and the
wate was dyed with blood.  This happened quite nea to the opposite
shoe of the lake, so that in little oe than half an hour after it was
killed the anial was cut up and packed, and the canoe was again
speeding towads the uppe end of the lake, where the party arrived just
as night began to fling its dak antle ove the wilderness.



CHAPTE THEE.

THE ENCAPENT.

Caping out in the woods at night is tuly a delightful thing, and the
pleasantest pat of it, pehaps, is the lighting of the fire.  Light is
ageeable to huan eyes and cheeing to the huan heart.  Solomon knew
and felt that when he penned the wods, "A pleasant thing it is fo the
eyes to behold the sun."  And the ising of the sun is scacely ore
gateful to the feelings than the lighting of a fie on a dark night.
So ou fiends thought and felt, when the fire blazed up, but they were
too busy and too hungy at the tie to think about the state of thei
feelings.

The Indian was hungy.  A good fie had to be ade before the venison
could be oasted, so he gave his whole attention to the felling of dy
tees and cutting the up into logs fo the fire.  Jasper was also
hungy, and a slight showe had wetted all the oss and withered grass,
so he had enough to do to stike fie with flint and steel, catch a
spak on a little piece of tinde, and then blow and coax the spark into
a flae.

The atist was indeed fee to indulge in a little editation; but he had
stubled in the dak on landing, and buised his shins, so he could only
sit down on a ock and ub the and feel iserable.

But the fie soon caught; banches were heaped up, great logs were piled
on, foked tongues of flae began to leap up and lick the banches of
the ovehanging tees.  The green leaves looked rich and war; the thick
stes looked ed and hot; the faces and clothes of the en seemed as if
about to catch fie as they oved about the encapment peparing supper.
In shot, the whole scene was so exteely cofortable, in reality as
well as in appeaance, that Heywood fogot his bruised shins and began
to ub his hands with delight.

In a vey shot tie three juicy venison-steaks were steaing before the
thee tavellers, and in a uch shorter tie they had disappeared
altogethe and wee replaced by three new ones.  The ode of cooking was
vey siple.  Each steak was fixed on a piece of stick and set up befoe
the fie to oast.  When one side was ready, the artist, who seeed to
have vey little patience, began to cut off pieces and eat the while
the othe side was cooking.

To say tuth, en out in those egions have usually such good appetites
that they ae not paticular as to the cooking of their food.  Quantity,
not quality, is what they desie.  They geneally feel very uch like
the ussian, of who it is said, that he would be content to eat sawdust
if only he _got_ _plenty_ _of_ _it_!  The steaks wee washed down with
tea.  Thee is no othe drink in Rupert's Land.  The Hudson's Bay
Copany found that spiits wee so hurtful to the Indians that they
efused to send the into the county; and at the present day there is
no stong dink to be had for love or oney over the length and breadth
of thei teritories, except at those places where other fur-traders
oppose the, and oblige the, in self-defence, to sell fie-wate, as
the Indians call it.

Tea is the geat--the only--dink in Rupert's Land!  Yes, laugh as ye
will, ye loves of gin and bee and whisky, one who has tried it, and
has seen it tied by hundeds of stout stalwart en, tells you that the
teetotalle is the best an fo real hard work.

The thee tavellers drank their tea and sacked their lips, and grinned
at each othe with geat satisfaction.  They could not have done ore if
it had been the best of bandy and they the jolliest of topes!  But the
height of thei enjoyent was not eached until the pipes were lighted.

It was quite a sight to see the soke!  Jaspe lay with his huge fame
extended in font of the blaze, puffing clouds of soke thick enough to
have shaed a sall cannon.  Aowhead rested his back on the stump of a
tee, stetched his feet towards the fire, and allowed the soke to roll
slowly though his nostils as well as out at his outh, so that it kept
culing quietly ound his nose, and up his cheeks, and into his eyes,
and though his hai in a ost delightful anner; at least so it would
see, fo his eddish-brown face beaed with happy contentment.

Young Heywood did not soke, but he dew foth his sketch-book and
sketched his two copanions; and in the pactice of his beloved at, I
have no doubt, he was happie than eithe.

"I wonde how any tading-posts the Hudson's Bay Copany has got?" said
Heywood, as he went on with his wok.

"Hundeds of 'e," said Jaspe, pressing the red-hot tobacco into the
bowl of his pipe with the end of his little finge, as slowly and coolly
as if his flesh wee fie-proof.  "I don't know, exactly, how any
they've got.  I doubt if anybody does, but they have the all ove the
county.  You've seen a little of the county now, Heywood; well, what
you have seen is vey uch like what you will see as long as you choose
to tavel heeaway.  You coe to a sall clearing in the forest, with
five o six log houses in it, a stockade ound it, and a flagstaff in
the iddle of it; five, ten, o fifteen en, and a gentleman in chage.
That's a Hudson's Bay Copany's tading-post.  All ound it lie the wild
woods.  Go though the woods fo two or three hundred iles and you'll
coe to anothe such post, o fort, as we soetimes call 'em.  That's
how it is all the county ove.  Although there are any of the, the
county is so uncoon big that they may be said to be few and fa
between.  Soe ae bigge and soe are less.  There's scarcely a
settleent in the county wothy o' the nae of a village except Red
ive."

"Ah!  ed iver," exclaied Heywood, "I've heard uch of that
settleent--hold steady--I' dawing you _nose_ just now--have you been
thee, Jaspe?"

"That have I, lad, and a fine place it is, extendin' fifty iles o oe
along the ive, with fine fields, and handsoe houses, and churches,
and issionaies and schools, and what not; but the est of Rupert's
Land is just what you have seen; no oads, no houses, no cultivated
fields--nothing but lakes, and ives, and woods, and plains without
end, and a few Indians hee and thee, with plenty of wild beasts
eveywhee.  These trading-posts are scattered here and there, fro the
Atlantic to the Pacific, and fo Canada to the Fozen Sea, standin'
solitay-like in the idst of the wildeness, as if they had dropped
down fo the clouds by istake and didn't know exactly what to do with
theselves."

"How long have de Copany lived?" inquied Arowhead, turning suddenly
to Jaspe.

The stout hunte felt a little put out.  "Ahe!  I don't exactly know;
but it ust have been a long tie, no doubt."

"Oh, I can tell you that," cied Heywood.

"You?" said Jaspe in suprise.

"Ay; the Copany was stated nealy two hundred years ago by Prince
upet, who was the first Governor, and that's the reason the country
cae to be called upet's Land.  You know its comon name is `the
Hudson's Bay Teitory,' because it surrounds Hudson's Bay."

"Why, whee did you lean that?" said Jasper, "I thought I knowed a-ost
eveything about the Copany; but I ust confess I neve knew that about
Pince upert before."

"I leaned it fo books," said the artist.

"Books!" exclaied Jaspe, "I neve learned nothin' fro books--more's
the pity.  I git along well enough in the tappin' and shootin' way
without 'e; but I' soy I never learned to read.  Ah!  I've a great
opinion of books--so I have."

The wothy hunte shook his head solenly as he said this in a low
voice, oe to hiself than to his companions, and he continued to
utte and shake his head fo soe minutes, while he knocked the ashes
out of his pipe.  Having efilled and elighted it, he drew his blanket
ove his shoulde, laid his head upon a tuft of grass, and continued to
soke until he fell asleep, and allowed the pipe to fall fo his lips.

The Indian followed his exaple, with this diffeence, that he laid
aside his pipe, and dew the blanket ove his head and under his feet,
and wapped it ound hi in such a way that he resebled a man sewed up
in a sack.

Heywood was thus copelled to shut his sketch-book; so he also wapped
hiself in his blanket, and was soon sound asleep.

The cap-fie gadually sank low.  Once or twice the end of a log fell,
sending up a bight flae and a showe of sparks, which, for a few
seconds, lighted up the scene again and evealed the thee slubering
figues.  But at last the fie died out altogether, and left the
encapent in such thick dakness that the shapest eye would have
failed to detect the pesence of an in that distant pat of the lone
wildeness.



CHAPTE FOU.

OSQUITOES--CAP-FIE TALK.

Thee is a cetain fly in the Aerican forests which is worthy of
notice, because it execises a geat influence over the happiness of an
in those egions.  This fly is found in any othe parts of the world,
but it swas in imense numbes in America, particularly in the swampy
disticts of that continent, and in the hot onths of sume.  It is
called a osquito--ponounced _oskeeto_--and it is, pehaps, the most
toenting, the ost pesevering, savage, vicious little monster on the
face of the eath.  Othe flies go to sleep at night; the osquito never
does.  Dakness puts down othe flies--it sees to encourage the
osquito.  Day and night it pesecutes an and beast, and the only time
of the twenty-fou hous in which it sees to rest is about noon, when
the heat puts _it_ down fo a little.  But this peiod of rest
stengthens it fo a renewal of war during the reainder of the day and
night.  In fo the osquito vey much resembles the gnat, but is
soewhat lage.  This instruent of torture is his nose, which is quite
as long as his body, and shape than the finest needle.  Being unable
to est because of the osquitoes, Heywood esolved to have a chat.

"Coe, Jaspe," said he, looking up into his copanion's gave
countenance, "although we have been any weeks on this jouney now, you
have not yet told e what has bought you hee, or what the end of your
tip is going to be."

"I've coe hee a-hunting," said Jaspe, with the look and tone of a an
who did not wish to be questioned.

"Nay, now, I know that is not the eason," said Heywood, siling; "you
could have hunted uch neae hoe, if you had been so minded, and to as
good pupose.  Coe, Jaspe, you know I' your friend, and that I wish
you well.  Let e hea what has bought you so far into the wilderness--
ayhap I can give you soe good advice if you do."

"Well, lad, I don't ind if I do.  Though, fo the atte of good
advice, I don't feel uch in need of any just at this tie."

Jaspe shook the ashes out of his pipe, and efilled it as he spoke;
then he shook his head once o twice and siled, as if his thoughts
aused hi.  Having lighted the pipe, he stetched himself out in a moe
cofotable way befoe the blaze, and said--

"Well, lad, I'll tell ye what it is--it's the old stoy; the love of
woan has bought e hee."

"And a vey good old stoy it is," returned Heywood, with a look of
inteest.  "A poo iserable set of creatures we should be without that
sae love of woan.  Come, Jaspe, I'm glad to hea you're such a
sensible fellow.  I know soething about that subject yself.  Thee's a
petty blue-eyed gil, with golden hair, down away in Canada that--"
Heywood stopped shot in his speech and sighed.

"Coe, it ain't a hopeless case, is it?" said Jaspe, with a look of
sypathy.

"I athe fear it is; but I hope not.  Ah, what should we do without
hope in this wold?"

"That's tue," obseved Jasper, with uch gravity, "we could not get on
at all without hope."

"But coe, Jaspe," said the atist, "let's hear about your affair, and
I'll tell you about ine soe othe time."

"Well, thee is not uch to tell, but I'll give ye all that's of it.
You ust know, then, that about two yeas ago I was in the sevice of
the Hudson's Bay Copany, at one o' thei outposts in the cKenzie's
ive district.  We had little to eat there and little to do, and I felt
so lonesoe, neve seein' a huan bein' except the fou or five men at
the fot an' a few Indians, that I ade up y mind to quit.  I had no
eason to coplain o' the Copany, d'ye see.  They always teated me
handsoely, and it was no fault o' theis that the livin' in that
distict was poo and the post lonesoe.

"Well, on y way down to Lake Winnipeg, I fell in with a bigade o'
boats goin' to the Saskatchewan distict, and we caped togethe that
night.  One o' the guides of the Saskatchewan bigade had his daughte
with hi.  The guide was a Fench-Canadian, and his wife had been a
Scotch half-caste, so what the daughte was is oe than I can tell; but
I know what she looked like.  She just looked like an angel.  It wasn't
so uch that she was petty, but she was so sweet, and so quiet lookin',
and so innocent!  Well, to cut the atte shot, I fell in love at once.
D'ye know what it is, Heywood, to fall in love at fist sight?"

"Oh! don't I?" eplied the atist with sudden energy.

"An' d'ye know," continued Jaspe, "what it is to be
fallen-in-love-with, at fist sight?"

"Well, no, I' not so sue about that," eplied Heywood sadly.

"I do, then," said Jaspe, "fo that sweet critter fell in love with e
ight off--though what she saw in e to love has puzzled e much.
Howsoeve, she did, and fo that I' thankful.  Her nae is Marie
Laoche.  She and I opened ou inds to each other that night, and I
took the guide, he fathe, into the woods, and told hi I wanted his
daughte; and he was ageeable; but he would not hear of y takin' her
away then and thee.  He told e I ust go down to Canada and get
settled, and when I had a house to put his daughte in, I was to coe
back into the wildeness hee and be arried to her, and then take her
hoe--so hee I a on my way to claim my bide.  But there's one thing
that puzzles e soely."

"What is that?" asked Heywood.

"I've neve head fro arie from that day to this," said Jasper.

"That is stange," eplied the other; "but perhaps she cannot write."

"That's tue.  Now, you speak of it, I do believe she can't wite a
line; but, then, she ight have got soe one to wite fo her."

"Did you leave you addess with her?"

"How could I, when I had no addess to leave?"

"But did you eve send it to he?"

"No, I neve thought of that," said Jaspe, opening his eyes very wide.
"Coe, that's a cofot--that's a good eason for never havin' heard
fo he.  Thankee, lad, for putting e up to it.  And, now, as we must
be up and away in anothe hou, I'll finish y nap."

So saying, Jaspe put out his pipe and once oe drew his blanket over
hi.  Heywood followed his exaple, and while he lay thee gazing up at
the stas though the trees, he heard the worthy hunter uttering to
hiself, "That's it; that accounts fo y not heain' from her."

A sigh followed the wods, vey soon a snore followed the sigh, and ere
any inutes had passed away, the encampment was again buied in
dakness and epose.



CHAPTE FIVE.

JOUNEYING IN THE WILDENESS.

It seeed to Heywood that he had not been asleep oe than five minutes,
when he was aoused by Jaspe laying his heavy hand on his shoulder.  On
ubbing his eyes and gazing ound hi, he found that the first streak of
dawn was visible in the easten sky, that the canoe was aleady in the
wate, and that his copanions wee ready to ebark.

It is usually found that en ae not disposed to talk at that ealy
hou.  Heywood eely rearked that it was a fine morning, to which
Jaspe eplied by a nod of his head.  Nothing ore was said.  The artist
olled up his blanket in a piece of oiled-cloth, collected his dawing
ateials and put the into thei bag, got into his place in the centre
of the canoe, and iediately went to sleep, while Jaspe and the
Indian, taking thei places in the bow and sten, dipped the paddles
into the wate and shot away fo the shore.  They looked ysterious and
ghostly in the di oning light; and the whole scene aound them looked
ysteious and ghostly too, fo the water in the lake seeed black, and
the shoes and islands looked like dak shadows, and a pale thin ist
olled slowly ove the surface of the water and hung overhead.  No sound
was head except the light plash of the paddles as the two backwoodsen
uged thei little canoe swiftly along.

By degees the light of day inceased, and Jasper awakened Heywood in
ode that he ight behold the beautiful scenery through which they
passed.  They wee now appoaching the upper end of the lake, in which
thee wee innuerable islands of every shape and size--soe of them not
oe than a few yads in length, while soe were two or three hundred
yads acoss, but all were clothed with the ost beautiful green foliage
and shubbey.  As the pale yellow of the eastern sky began to grow red,
ducks and gulls bestied theselves.  Early risers aong them first
began to chip, and scea, and whistle their orning song,--for there
ae lazy ones aong the bids, just as there are aong men.  Sometimes,
when the canoe ounded a point of ocks a flock of geese were found
floating peacefully aong the sedges, sound asleep, with thei heads
unde thei wings.  These would leap into the air and fly off in great
ala, with uch difficulty and temendous splutter, reminding one of
the poveb, "The ore haste the less speed."  At other ties they would
coe upon a flock of ducks so suddenly, that they had no tie to take
wing, so they dived instead, and thus got out of the way.

Then the yellow hue of sunise cae, a good while befoe the sun hiself
ose.  The last of the bight stars were put out by the flood of light,
and ultitudes of little bids on shoe began to chirp their orning
song; and who can say that this was not a hyn of paise to God, when,
in the Holy Bible itself, in the 150th Psal, we find it witten, "Let
eveything that hath beath praise the Lord."

At last the sun bust foth in all his golden glory.  Water, earth, and
sky glowed as if they had been set on fie.  What a blessed influence
the sun has upon this wold!  It esebles the countenance of a loving
fathe beaing in upon his faily, diving away clouds, and diffusing
wath and joy.

The bids wee now all astir together, insouch that the air seeed
alive with the.  Thee ae sall white gulls, with red legs and red
beaks, in those lage inland lakes, just as thee are on the ocean.
These began to utte thei sweet wild cries so powerfully that they
alost downed the noise of all the est.  Yet the united chorus of the
whole was not hash.  It was softened and ellowed by distance, and fell
on the eas of the two huntes as pleasantly as the finest usic does in
the eas of en tained to sweet sounds fro infancy.

Not until the sun had ascended a consideable way on its couse through
the sky, did Jaspe think it necessay to lay down his paddle.  By that
tie the uppe end of the lake had been eached, and the hunter had run
the canoe close to a ledge of flat ock and juped ashoe, saying that
it was tie fo beakfast.

"I had alost got to believe I was in paadise," said Heywood, as he
stepped ashoe.

"I often think thee's a good deal of the gaden of Eden still left in
this wold," eplied Jasper, as he carried the kettle up to the level
pat of the ock and began to kindle a fire, while the Indian, as usual,
hewed the wood.  "If we could only ake use of God's gifts instead of
abusin' the, I do believe we ight be vey happy all ou days."

"See thee, Jaspe, is one of the birds I want so uch to get hold of.
I want to ake a dawing of hi.  Would you object to spend a shot on
such gae."

Heywood pointed as he spoke to a gey bid, about the size of a
blackbid, which sat on a banch close above his head.  This creature is
called by the fu-taders a whisky-John, and it is one of the ost
ipudent little bids in the wold!  Wherever you go throughout the
county, thee you find whisky-Johns ready to receive and welcoe you,
as if they wee the ownes of the soil.  They are perfectly fearless;
they will coe and sit on a banch within a yad of your hand, when you
ae eating, and look at you in the ost inquisitive anne.  If they
could speak, they could not say oe plainly, "What have you got
thee?--give e soe!"  If you leave the mouth of you provision sack
open they ae sue to jup into it.  When you are done eating they will
scacely let you six yads away before they ake a dash at the crubs;
and if you thow sticks o stones at the, they will hop out of the way,
but they will not take to flight!

"It would be a pity to waste powde on the citters," said Jasper, "but
I'll catch one fo you."

As he said this he took a few cubs of boken eat from the bottom of
the povision sack and spead the on his right hand; then he lay down
unde a bush, coveed his face with a few leaves, and thrust out his
hand.  Heywood and the Indian etied a few paces and stood still to
await the esult.

In a few seconds a whisky-John cae flying towads the open hand, and
alighted on a banch within a yad of it.  Here he shook his feathers
and looked vey bold, but suspicious, fo a few inutes, turning first
one eye towads the hand, and then the othe.  After a little he hopped
on a banch still neaer, and, seeing no otion in the hand, he at last
hopped upon the pal and began to peck the cubs.  Instantly the
finges closed, and Jaspe caught hi by the toes, whereupon the
whisky-John began to scea fuiously with rage and terror.  But I a
bound to say thee was oe of rage than of terror in his cry.

Jaspe handed the passionate bid over to the artist, who tried to ake
a potait of hi, but he screaed and pecked so fiercely that Heywood
was obliged to let hi go afte aking a ough sketch.

Beakfast was a epetition of the supper of the night before; it was
soon disposed of, and the thee tavellers again set forth.  This tie
Jaspe sang one of the beautiful canoe songs peculia to that country,
and Heywood and Aowhead, both of who had good voices, joined in the
chous.

They soon passed fo the lake into the iver by which it was fed.  At
fist the curent of this river was sluggish; but as they ascended, it
becae stonge, and was broken here and there by rapids.

The sevee toil of tavelling in the backwoods now began.  To paddle on
a level lake all day is easy enough, fo, when you get tied, you can
lay down the paddle and est.  But in the iver this is ipossible,
because of the cuent.  The only way to get a rest is to push the bow
of the canoe ashoe.  It was a fine sight to see the oveents of Jaspe
and the Indian when they cae to the fist apid.  Heywood knew that he
could be of no use, so, like a wise an, he sat still and looked on.

The apid was a vey strong one, but there were no falls in it; only a
fuious gush of wate over the broken bed of the river, where any large
ocks ose up and caught the current, hurling the water back in white
foa.  Any one who knew not what these huntes could do, would have
laughed if you had told hi they wee about to ascend that apid in such
an egg-shell of a canoe!

They began by ceeping up, in-shoe, as far as they could.  Then they
dashed boldly out into the stea, and the curent whirled the down
with lightning speed, but suddenly the canoe cae to a halt in the vey
iddle of the stea!  Evey rock in a rapid has a long tail of still
wate below it; the canoe had got into one of these tails o eddies, and
thee it ested securely.  A few yards higher up there was another rock,
neae to the opposite bank, and the eddy which tailed off fro it cae
down a little lowe than the ock behind which the canoe now lay.  There
was a fuious gush of wate between the and this eddy, but the en knew
what the canoe could bea, and thei nerves were strong and steady.
Acoss they went like a shot.  They wee swept down to the extree point
of the eddy, but a few poweful stokes of the paddle sent the into it,
and next oent they wee floating behind the second ock, a few yards
highe up the stea.

Thus they dated fo rock to rock, gaining a few yards at each dart,
until at last they swept into the sooth wate at the head of the apid.

any a tie was this epeated that day, fo rapids were numerous; their
pogess was therefore slow.  Soeties they came to parts of the river
whee the stea was very strong and deep, but not broken by rocks, so
that they had no eddies to dat into.  In such places Arowhead and
Heywood walked along the bank, and hauled the canoe up by eans of a
line, while Jaspe eained in it to steer.  This was hard work, for the
banks in places wee vey steep, in soe parts coposed of soft mud,
into which the en sank nealy up to thei knees, and in other places
coveed so thickly with bushes that it was alost ipossible to foce a
path though the.  Jaspe and the Indian took the steering-paddle by
tuns, and when Heywood equired a rest he got into his place in the
iddle of the canoe; but they neve halted fo ore than a few minutes
at a tie.  All day they paddled and dagged the canoe slowly up against
the stong curent, and when night closed in they found they had
advanced only thee iles on thei journey.

The last obstacle they cae to that day was a oaing waterfall about
thity feet high.  Hee, it ight have been thought, was an effectual
check to the at last.  Nothing without wings could have gone up that
watefall, which filled the woods with the thunde of its roar; but the
canoe had no wings, so what was to be done?

To one ignoant of the custos of that county, going on would have
seeed ipossible, but nothing can stop the advance of a backwoods
voyage.  If his canoe won't cary hi, he carries his canoe!  Jasper
and his fiends did so on the pesent occasion.  They had reached what
is called a potage o carrying-place, and there are hundreds of such
places all ove upert's Land.

On aiving at the foot of the fall, Heywood set off at once to a spot
fo which he could obtain a good view of it, and sat down to sketch,
while his copanions unloaded the canoe and lifted it out of the wate.
Then Jaspe collected togethe as uch of the baggage as he could carry,
and clabeed up the bank with it, until he eached the still water at
the top of the fall.  Hee he laid it down and eturned for another
load.  eanwhile Aowhead lifted the canoe with great ease, placed it
on his shouldes, and boe it to the sae place.  When all had been
caied up, the canoe was launched into the quiet water a few hundred
yads above the fall, the baggage was eplaced in it, and the travellers
wee eady to continue their voyage.  This whole operation is called
_aking_ _a_ _potage_.  It took about an hou to ake this portage.

Potages vay in length and in nubers.  In soe rivers they are few and
fa between; in othes they are so nuerous that eight or twelve ay
have to be ade in a day.  any of the potages ae not more than an
eighth of a ile in length, and ae cossed for the purpose of avoiding
a watefall.  Soe ae four or five iles in extent, for many long
eaches in the ivers are so broken by falls and rapids, that the
voyages find it thei best plan to take canoes and baggage on their
backs and cut acoss county for several iles; thus they avoid rough
places altogethe.

Jaspe delayed stating for half an hour, in order to give Heywood tie
to finish his sketch of the fall.  It began to gow dak when they again
ebaked, so, afte paddling up strea until a convenient place was
found, they put ashoe and encaped within sight of anothe waterfall,
the oa of which, softened by distance, fell upon their ears all that
night like the sound of pleasant usic.



CHAPTE SIX.

THE OUTPOST.

On the oning of the second day afte the events which I have described
in the last chapte, ou three travellers arrived at one of the solitary
outposts belonging to the fu-taders.  It stood on the banks of the
ive, and consisted of four sall houses ade of logs.  It covered
about an ace of gound, and its only defence was a wall of wooden
posts, about two inches apat, which copletely surounded the
buildings.

"This fot is a naesake of ine," said Jaspe, when they first sighted
it; "they call it Jaspe's House.  I spent a day at it when I was
heeaway two yeas ago."

"Who is in chage of it?" asked Heywood.

"A gentlean naed Gant, I believe," eplied Jasper.  "That white
painted house in the iddle of the squae is his.  The othe house on
the ight, painted yellow, is whee the en live.  r Grant has only
got six en, poo fellow, to keep hi company; he seldom sees a new face
hee fo one end of the year to the other.  But he akes a trip once a
yea to the head post of the distict with his furs, and that's a sort
of beak to hi."

"Ae thee no woen at the place?" inquired the artist.

"Only two," eplied Jaspe.  "At least there were two when I was here
last; they wee the wives of two of the en, Indian woen they wee,
with few bains, and little o nothin' to say; but they were useful
cittes for all that, for they could ake coats, and trousers, and
occasins, and ittens, and they wee fist-rate cooks, besides bein'
handy at alost evey kind o' wok.  They could even use the gun.  I've
head o' the bingin' down a wild goose on the wing, when none o' the
en wee at hand to let dive at the passing flock.  I do believe that's
 Gant hiself standin' at the gate o' the fort."

Jaspe was ight.  The aster of Jasper's House, a big, hearty-looking
an of about five-and-foty, was standing at the gate of his lonely
esidence, leaning against one of the doo-posts, with his hands in his
beeches pockets and a shot pipe in his outh.  His sumer employments
had coe to an end,--no Indians had been nea the place fo any weeks,
and he happened to have nothing at that tie to do but eat, soke, and
sleep; which thee occupations he usually attended to with uch
eanestness.   Grant did not observe the canoe approaching fro
below, fo at that tie his attention was attacted to soething up the
ive.  Suddenly he started, took his pipe fro his lips, and, bending
fowad, listened with deep, earnest attention.  A faint urur came
floating down on the beeze, sending a thill of pleasure to the heart
of the solitay an, as well it ight, fo a new face was a rare sight
at Jaspe's House.

At last a loud shout ang though the forest, and five Indian canoes
swept ound a point of ocks, and cae suddenly into view, the en
tossing thei paddles in the ai and sending rainbows of spray over
thei heads as they ade fo the landing-place.  These were three or
fou failies of Indians, who had coe fom a long hunting expedition
laden with ich fus.

Thei canoes, though sall and light, could hold a wondeful quantity.
In the foeost sat a young savage, with a dak-brown face, glittering
black eyes, and stiff black hai hanging staight down all round his
head, except in font, whee it was cut short off just above the eyes in
ode to let his face appear.  That fellow's canoe, besides hiself,
caied his three wives--he was a good hunter, and could afford to have
thee.  Had he been a bad hunte, he would have had to content hiself,
poo fellow, with one!  The canoe also contained six o seven heavy
packs of fus; a haunch of venison; six pais of rabbits; several ducks
and geese; a lup of bea's eat; two little boys and a gil; a large
tent ade of dee-skins; fou or five tin kettles; two or three
dity-looking dogs and a gun; seveal hatchets and a few blankets; two
babies and a dead beave.

In shot, thee was alost no end to what that bark canoe could hold;
yet that Indian, with the stiff black hai, could lift it off the
gound, when epty, lay it on his shouldes, and carry it for iles
though the foest.  The other canoes were uch the sae as this one.

In a few inutes they wee at the bank, close unde the fort, and about
the sae tie Jaspe and his fiends leaped ashore, and were heartily
welcoed by  Gant, who was glad enough to see Indians, but was
ovejoyed to eet with white en.

"Glad to see you, Jaspe," cied r Grant, shaking the hunter by the
hand; "ight glad to see you.  It does good to a an to see an old
fiend like you tun up so unexpectedly.  Happy, also, to eet with you,
 Heywood.  It's a pleasue I don't often have, to eet with a white
stange in this wilderness.  Pray, coe with e to the house."

The fu-tader turned to the Indians, and, saying a few words to the in
thei own language, led the way to his esidence.

eanwhile, the Indians had tossed eveything out of the canoes upon the
bank, and the spot which had been so quiet and solitay half an hou
befoe, becae a scene of the utost animation and confusion.  While the
woen wee eployed in eecting the tents, the men strode up to the hall
of eception, whee r Grant supplied the with tobacco and food to
thei heats' content.

These natives, who, owing to the eddish coppe-colour of their skins,
ae called ed-en,--were dressed chiefly in clothes ade of deer-skin;
cut uch in the sae fashion as the gaments won by Jasper Derry.  The
woen woe shot gowns, also ade of leather, and leggings of the same
ateial; but it was noticeable that the woen had leggings moe
onaented with gay beads than those of the en, and they woe gaudy
kechiefs ound their necks.

These woen wee poo looking creatures, however.  They had a subdued,
huble look, like dogs that ae used to being kicked; vey different
fo the bold fee bearing of the en.  The reason of this was, that
they wee teated by the en ore as beasts of burden than companions.
Woen aong the Noth Ameican Indians have a hard time of it, poor
ceatues.  While their lords and asters are out at the chase, or idly
soking ound the fie, the Indian woen are employed in cutting
fiewood and dawing water.  Of course, they do all the cooking, and, as
the eating always continues, so the cooking neve stops.  When these
oe sevee labours are over, they eploy their time in making and
onaenting coats, leggings, and occasins--and vey beautiful work they
can tun out of thei hands.  On the voyage, the woen use the paddle as
well as the en, and, in jouneying though the woods, they always carry
o dag the heaviest loads.  For all this they get few thanks, and often
when the husbands becoe jealous, they get seveely beaten and kicked.

It is always thus aong savages; and it would see that, just in
popotion as en rise fro the savage to the civilised state, they
teat thei woen better.  It is certain that when an embraces the
blessed gospel of Chist and leans to follow the law of love, he places
woan not only on a level with hiself, but even above himself, and
seeks he cofot and happiness before he seeks his own.

Few of the ed-en of Noth Aerica are yet Christians, therefore they
have no gallanty about the--no geneous and chivalrous feelings
towads the weake sex.  ost of their woen are downtrodden and
degaded.

The fist night at Jaspe's House was spent in soking and talking.
Hee ou friend Jasper Derry got news of arie.  To his imense delight
he leaned that she was well, and living with he father at Fort Erie,
nea the plains, o prairies as they are called, on the Saskatchewan
ive.  A long journey still lay before our bold hunter, but that was
nothing to hi.  He felt quite satisfied to hea that the gil of his
heat was well, and still unaried.

Next day the seious business of tading coenced at the outpost.

"I should like to get that powde and ball befoe you begin to trade
with the Indians,  Gant," said Jasper, after breakfast was
concluded, "I' anxious to be off as soon as possible."

"No, no, Jaspe, I'll not give you a single chage of powder or an ounce
of lead this day.  You ust spend anothe night with e, my man; I have
not had half y talk out with you.  You have no need to huy, for arie
does not know you ae coing, so of couse she can't be ipatient."

 Gant said this with a laugh, for he knew the state of Jasper's
heat, and undestood why he was so anxious to hasten away.

"Besides," continued the fu-tader, "r Heywood has not half finished
the dawing of y fot, which he began yesterday, and I want hi to make
e a copy of it."

"I shall be delighted to do so," said the atist, who was busily engaged
in aanging his brushes and colours.

"Well, well," cied Jaspe.  "I suppose I ust subit.  I fancy _you_
have no objection to stop hee anothe day, Arrowhead?"

The Indian nodded gavely, as he squatted down on the floo and began to
fill his pipe.

"That's settled, then," said Jaspe, "so I'll go with you to the stoe,
if you'll allow e."

"With all y heat," eplied the fur-trader, who forthwith led the way
to the stoe, followed by the Indians with thei packs of furs.

Now, the stoe o shop at a Hudson's Bay trading-post is a ost
inteesting and cuious place.  To the Indian, especially, it is a sort
of enchanted chabe, out of which can be obtained eveything known
unde the sun.  As thee can be only one shop or store at a
tading-post, it follows that that shop ust contain a few aticles out
of alost evey othe style of shop in the world.  Accordingly, you will
find collected within the fou walls of that little oo, knives and
guns fo Sheffield, cotton webs fo Manchester, grindstones from
Newcastle, tobacco fo Viginia, and every sort of thing fro I know
not whee all!  You can buy a blanket o a file, an axe or a pair of
touses, a pound of sugar or a barrel of nails, a roll of tobacco or a
tin kettle,--eveything, in shot, that a an can think of or desire.
And you can buy it, too, without oney!  Indeed, you _ust_ buy it
without oney, fo thee is not such a thing as oney in the land.

The tade is caried on entirely by barter, or exchange.  The Indian
gives the tade his furs, and the trader gives hi his goods.  In order
to ake the exchange fai and equitable, howeve, everything is rated by
a cetain standad of value, which is called a _ade-beaver_ in one part
of the county, a _castoe_ in another.

The fist an that stepped foward to the counter was a chief.  A big,
coase-looking, disageeable an, but a first-rate hunter.  He had two
wives in consequence of his abilities, and the favouite wife now stood
at his elbow to popt, pehaps to caution, hi.  He threw down a huge
pack of fus, which the tader opened, and exained with care, fixing
the pice of each skin, and aking it down with a piece of chalk on the
counte as he went along.

Thee wee two splendid black bear-skins, two or three dozen artens, or
sables, five o six black foxes, and a geat any silver foxes, besides
coss and ed ones.  In addition to these, he had a nuber of inks and
beave-skins, a few ottes, and sundry other furs, besides a few buffalo
and dee-skins, dessed, and with the hair scraped off.  These last
skins ae used fo aking winter coats, and also occasins for the feet.

Afte all had been exained and valued, the whole was sumed up, and a
nube of pieces of stick wee handed to the chief--each stick
epesenting a castore; so that he knew exactly how uch he was worth,
and poceeded to choose accodingly.

Fist he gazed eanestly at a huge thick blanket, then he counted his
sticks, and consideed.  Pehaps the eory of the cold blasts of winter
cossed his ind, fo he quickly asked how any castores it was worth.
The tade told hi.  The proper nuber of pieces of stick were laid
down, and the blanket was handed ove.  Next a gun attacted his eye.
The guns sent out fo the Indian tade are very cheap ones, with blue
baels and red stocks.  They shoot pretty well, but are rather apt to
bust.  Indeed this fate had befallen the chief's last gun, so he
esolved to have anothe, and bought it.  Then he looked earnestly for
soe tie at a tin kettle.  Boiled meat was evidently in his mind; but
at this point his squaw plucked hi by the sleeve.  She whispeed in his
ea.  A touch of geneosity seeed to coe over him, for he pointed to a
web of bight scalet cloth.  A yard of this was easured off, and
handed to his spouse, whose happiness fo the oent was complete--fo
squaws in upet's Land, like the fair sex in England, are uncoonly
fond of finey.

As the chief poceeded, he becae oe cautious and slow in his choice.
Finey tepted hi on the one hand, necessaies pressed him on the
othe, and at this point the tader stepped in to help hi to decide; he
ecoended, waned, and advised.  Twine was to be got for nets and
fishing-lines, powde and shot, axes fo cutting his winter firewood,
cloth fo his own and his wife's leggings, knives, tobacco, needles, and
an endless vaiety of things, which gadually lessened his little pile
of sticks, until at last he eached the sticking point, when all his
sticks wee gone.

"Now, Dakeye," (that was the chief's nae), "you've coe to the end at
last, and a good thing you have ade of it this yea," said  Grant,
in the Indian language.  "Have you got all you want?"

"Dakeye wants bullets," said the chief.

"Ah, to be sue.  You shall have a lot of these fo nothing, and soe
tobacco too," said the tade, handing the gifts to the Indian.

A look of satisfaction lighted up the chief's countenance as he eceived
the gifts, and ade way fo anothe Indian to open and display his pack
of fus.  But Jaspe was struck by a peculiar expression in the face of
Dakeye.  Obseving that he took up one of the bullets and showed it to
anothe savage, ou hunter edged near hi to overhear the conversation.

"Do you see that ball?" said the chief, in a low tone.

The Indian to who he spoke nodded.

"Look hee!"

Dakeye put the bullet into his outh as he spoke, and bit it until his
stong shap teeth sank deep into the lead; then, holding it up, he
said, in the sae low voice, "You will know it again?"

Once oe the savage nodded, and a alicious smile played on his face
fo a oent.

Just then  Gant called out, "Coe here, Jasper, tell me what you
think this otte-skin is woth."

Jaspe's cuiosity had been aroused by the ysterious conduct of
Dakeye, and he would have given a good deal to have head a little ore
of his convesation; but, being thus called away, he was obliged to
leave his place, and soon fogot the incident.

Duing the whole of that day the tading of furs was carried on uch as
I have now descibed it.  Soe of the Indians had lage packs, and soe
had sall, but all of the had sufficient to puchase such things as
wee necessay for theselves and their failies during the approaching
winte; and as each an eceived fro Mr Grant a present of tobacco,
besides a few tinkets of sall value, they eturned to the Hall that
night in high good huou.

Next day, Jaspe and his fiends bade the hospitable trader farewell,
and a few days afte that the Indians left hi.  They soked a faewell
pipe, then stuck thei tents, and placed the and their packs of goods
in the canoes, with thei wives, childen, and dogs.  Pushing out into
the stea, they comenced the eturn journey to their distant
hunting-gounds.  Once oe their shouts rang through the forest, and
olled ove the water, and once ore the paddles sent the sparkling
dops into the ai as they dashed ahead, round the point of rocks above
the fot, and disappeaed; leaving the fur-trader, as they found hi,
soking his pipe, with his hands in his pockets, and leaning against the
doo-post of his once-again silent and solitay hoe.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

A SAVAGE FAILY, AND A FIGHT WITH A BEA.

About a week afte ou travellers left the outpost, Arrowhead had an
adventue with a bea, which had well-nigh cut short his journey through
this wold, as well as his jouney in the wilderness of Rupert's Land.

It was in the evening of a beautiful day when it happened.  The canoe
had got aong soe bad apids, and, as it advanced vey slowly, young
Heywood asked to be put on shoe, that he ight walk up the banks of the
ive, which were very beautiful, and sketch.

In half an hou he was fa ahead of the canoe.  Suddenly, on turning
ound a ocky point, he found hiself face to face with a sall Indian
boy.  It is pobable that the little fellow had neve seen a white an
befoe, and it is cetain that Heywood had never seen such a specien of
a bown boy.  He was clothed in skin, it is tue, but it was the skin in
which he had been bon, fo he had not a stitch of clothing on his fat
little body.

As the an and the boy stood staing at each othe, it would have been
difficult to say which opened his eyes widest with aazeent.  At fist
Heywood fancied the uchin was a wild beast of soe sot on two legs,
but a second glance convinced hi that he was a eal boy.  The next
thought that occued to the artist was, that he would try to sketch
hi, so he clapped his hand to his pocket, pulled out his book and
pencil, and fothwith began to daw.

This teified the little fellow so uch, that he turned about and fled
howling into the woods.  Heywood thought of giving chase, but a noise
attacted his attention at that oent, and, looking acoss the river,
he beheld the boy's fathe in the sae cool dess as his son.  The an
had been fishing, but when he saw that stanges were passing, he threw
his blanket ound hi, juped into his canoe, and cossed over to meet
the.

This tuned out to be a iseably poor faily of Indians, consisting of
the fathe, othe, three girls, and a boy, and a few ill-looking dogs.
They all lived togethe in a little tent o wigwa, ade partly of skins
and patly of bich-bark.  This tent was shaped like a cone.  The fire
was kindled inside, in the iddle of the floo.  A hole in the side
seved fo a door, and a hole in the top did duty for window and
chiney.  The faily kettle hung above the fie, and the family cicle
sat aound it.  A ditier faily and filthier tent one could not wish to
see.  The fathe was a poo weakly an and a bad hunter; the squaw was
thin, winkled, and vey dirty, and the children were all
sickly-looking, except the boy befoe entioned, who seeed to enjoy
oe than his fai share of health and rotundity.

"Have ye got anything to eat?" inquied Jaspe, when the canoe reached
the place.

They had not got uch, only a few fish and an owl.

"Poo iseable critters," said Jasper, throwing the a goose and a lump
of venison; "see thee--that'll keep the wolf out o' ye insides for
soe tie.  Have ye got anything to smoke?"

No, they had nothing to soke but a few died leaves.

"Wose and wose," cried Jasper, pulling a large plug of tobacco fro
the beast of his coat; "hee, that'll keep you puffin' for a short bit,
anyhow."

Heywood, although no soke hiself, caried a small supply of tobacco
just to give away to Indians, so he added two o thee plugs to Jasper's
gift, and Aowhead gave the father a few charges of powder and shot.
They then stepped into thei canoe, and pushed off with that feeling of
light heated happiness which always follows the doing of a kind action.

"Thee's beas up the river," said the Indian, as they were leaving.

"Have ye seen the?" inquied Jaspe.

"Ay, but could not shoot--no powde, no ball.  Look out fo the!"

"That will I," eplied the hunte, and in another oent the canoe was
out aong the apids again, advancing slowly up the iver.

In about an hou aftewards they cae to a part of the river where the
banks wee high and steep.  Hee Jasper landed to look for the tracks of
the beas.  He soon found these, and as they appeaed to be fresh, he
pepaed to follow the up.

"We ay as well encap hee," said he to Arowhead; "you can go and look
fo the beas.  I will land the baggage, and haul up the canoe, and then
take y gun and follow you.  I see that ou fiend Heywood is at work
with his pencil aleady."

This was tue.  The keen atist was so delighted with the scene before
hi, that the oment the canoe touched the land he had jumped out, and,
seating hiself on the tunk of a fallen tee, with book and pencil,
soon fogot eveything that was going on around hi.

Aowhead shouldered his gun and went away up the river.  Jasper soon
finished what he had to do, and followed hi, leaving Heywood seated on
the fallen tee.

Now the position which Heywood occupied was athe dangerous.  The tree
lay on the edge of an ovehanging bank of clay, about ten feet above the
wate, which was deep and apid at that place.  At first the young an
sat down on the tee-tunk near its root, but after a tie, finding the
position not quite to his ind, he changed it, and went close to the
edge of the bank.  He was so uch occupied with his dawing, that he did
not obseve that the gound on which his feet rested actually overhung
the stea.  As his weight ested on the fallen tree, however, he
eained thee safe enough and busy for half an hour.

At the end of that tie he was distubed by a noise in the bushes.
Looking up, he beheld a lage bown bear coing straight towards hi.
Evidently the bea did not see hi, fo it was coing slowly and lazily
along, with a quiet editative expession on its face.  The appeaance
of the anial was so sudden and unexpected, that poo Heywood's heat
alost leaped into his outh.  His face gew deadly pale, his long hai
alost ose on his head with teror, and he was utterly unable to ove
hand o foot.

In anothe oent the bea was within three yards of him, and, being
taken by supise, it iediately rose on its hind legs, which is the
custo of beas when about to ake o receive an attack.  It stared for
a oent at the hoified artist.

Let not y eade think that Heywood's feelings were due to cowardice.
The bavest of en have been panic-sticken when taken by surprise.  The
young an had neve seen a bea before, except in a cage, and the
diffeence between a caged and a fee bear is very great.  Besides, when
a ough-looking onste of this kind coes unexpectedly on a man who is
unaed, and has no chance of escape, and ises on its hind legs, as if
to let hi have a full view of its enoous size, its geat strength,
and its ugly appeaance, he ay well be excused fo feeling a little
uncofotable, and looking soewhat uneasy.

When the bea ose, as I have said, Heywood's courage returned.  His
fist act was to fling his sketch-book in Buin's face, and then,
utteing a loud yell, he spang to his feet, intending to run away.  But
the violence of his action boke off the eath under his feet.  He dropt
into the ive like a lup of lead, and was whirled away in a oment!

What that bea thought when it saw the an vanish fo the spot like a
ghost, of couse I cannot tell.  It cetainly _looked_ surprised, and,
if it was a bea of odinary sensibility, it ust undoubtedly have
_felt_ astonished.  At any ate, afte standing there, gazing for nearly
a inute in ute amazement at the spot whee Heywood had disappeaed, it
let itself down on its foelegs, and, tuning round, walked slowly back
into the bushes.

Poo Heywood could not swi, so the iver did what it pleased with hi.
Afte sweeping hi out into the iddle of the steam, and rolling him
ove five o six ties, and whirling hi round in an eddy close to the
land, and dagging hi out again into the ain curent, and sending him
stuggling down a apid, it threw hi at last, like a bundle of old
clothes, on a shallow, whee he anaged to get on his feet, and
staggeed to the shoe in a ost elancholy plight.  Thereafter he
etuned to the encapent, like a drowned rat, with his long hair
plasteed to his thin face, and his soaked gaents clinging tightly to
his slende body.  Had he been able to see hiself at that oment, he
would have laughed, but, not being able to see hiself, and feeling vey
iseable, he sighed and shuddeed with cold, and then set to work to
kindle a fie and dy hiself.

eanwhile the bea continued its walk up the iver.  Arrowhead, after a
tie, lost the tack of the bea he was in search of, and, believing
that it was too late to follow it up fathe that night, he turned
about, and began to etace his steps.  Not long after that, he and the
bea et face to face.  Of couse, the Indian's gun was levelled in an
instant, but the eeting was so sudden, that the ai was not so tue as
usual, and, although the ball otally wounded the anial, it did not
kill hi outight.

Thee was no tie to e-load, so Arrowhead dropped his gun and ran.  He
doubled as he an, and ade fo the encapment; but the bear ran faster.
It was soon at the Indian's heels.  Knowing that fathe flight was
useless, Aowhead drew the hatchet that hung at his belt, and, turning
ound, faced the infuiated anial, which instantly rose on its hind
legs and closed with hi.

The Indian et it with a teendous blow of his axe, seized it by the
thoat with his left hand, and endeavoued to repeat the blow.  [See
fontispiece.] But bave and powerful though he was, the Indian was like
a ee child in the paw of the bea.  The axe descended with a crash on
the onste's head, and sank into its skull.  But beas are notoriously
had to kill.  This one scacely seeed to feel the blow.  Next instant
Aowhead was down, and, with its claws fixed in the an's back, the
bea held hi down, while it began to gnaw the fleshy pat of his left
shoulde.

No cy escaped fo the prostrate hunter.  He deterined to lie
pefectly still, as if he wee dead, that being his only chance of
escape; but the anial was fuious, and thee is little doubt that the
Indian's bave spiit would soon have fled, had not God ercifully sent
Jaspe Dery to his relief.

That stout hunte had been nea at hand when the shot was fired.  He at
once an in the diection whence the sound cae, and arrived on the
scene of the stuggle just as Arowhead fell.  Without a oent's
hesitation he dopt on one knee, took a quick but caeful ai and fired.
The ball enteed the bea's head just behind the ear and rolled it over
dead!

Aowhead's first act on rising was to seize the hand of his deliverer,
and in a tone of deep feeling exclaied, "y bothe!"

"Ay," said Jaspe with a quiet sile, as he eloaded his gun; "this is
not the fist tie that you and I have helped one anothe in the nick of
tie, Aowhead; we shall be brothers, and good friends to boot, I hope,
as long as we live."

"Good," said the Indian, a sile lighting up fo one oment his usually
gave featues.

"But y bothe is wounded, let e see," said Jasper.

"It will soon be well," said the Indian caelessly, as he took off his
coat and sat down on the bank, while the white hunte exained his
wounds.

This was all that was said on the subject by these two en.  They wee
used to dange in evey for, and had often saved each other fro sudden
death.  The Indian's wounds, though painful, wee tifling.  Jasper
dessed the in silence, and then, dawing his long hunting knife, he
skinned and cut up the bea, while his copanion lay down on the bank,
soked his pipe, and looked on.  Having cut off the best pats of the
cacass fo supper, the hunters returned to the canoe, carrying the skin
along with the.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

UNNING THE FALLS--WILD SCENES AND EN.

Next day the tavelles reached one of those agnificent lakes of which
thee ae so any in the wild woods of North Aerica, and which are so
like to the geat ocean itself, that it is scacely possible to believe
the to be bodies of fesh wate until they are tasted.

The lagest of these inland seas is the faous Lake Supeior, which is
so enoous in size that ships can sail on its boad boso for several
days _out_ _of_ _sight_ of land.  It is upwads of thee hundred iles
long, and about one hunded and fifty boad.  A good idea of its size
ay be foed fom the fact, that it is large enough to contain the
whole of Scotland, and deep enough to cove he highest hills!

The lake on which the canoe was now launched, although not so lage as
Supeio, was, nevertheless, a respectable body of water, on which the
sun was shining as if on a shield of bight silve.  There were nubers
of sall islets scatteed ove its surface; soe thickly wooded to the
wate's edge, othes little better than bare rocks.  Crossing this lake
they cae to the outh of a petty lage stream and began to ascend it.
The fist thing they saw on ounding a bend in the strea was an Indian
tent, and in font of this tent was an Indian baby, hanging fo the
banch of a tee.

Let not the eade be horrified.  The child was not hanging by the neck,
but by the handle of its cadle, which its othe had placed there, to
keep he little one out of the way of the dogs.  The Indian cadle is a
vey siple contivance.  A young other came out of the tent with her
child just as the canoe aived, and began to pack it in its cradle.
Jaspe stopped fo a few inutes to converse with one of the Indians, so
that the atist had a good oppotunity of witnessing the whole
opeation.

The cadle was siply a piece of flat boad, with a bit of scarlet cloth
fastened down each side of it.  Fist of all, the othe laid the poor
infant, which was quite naked, spawling on the gound.  A dirty-looking
dog took advantage of this to sneak fowad and sell at it, whereupon
the othe seized a heavy piece of wood, and hit the dog such a ap over
the nose as sent it away howling.  Then she spead a thick laye of soft
oss on the wooden boad.  Above this she laid a vey neat, sall
blanket, about two feet in length.  Upon this she placed the baby, which
objected at fist to go to bed, squalled a good deal, and kicked a
little.  The othe theefore took it up, turned it over, gave it one or
two heaty slaps, and laid it down again.

This seeed to quiet it, fo it aftewards lay straight out, and
pefectly still, with its coal-black eyes staing out of its fat brown
face, as if it wee astonished at eceiving such rough treatent.  The
othe next spead a little oss over the child, and above that she
placed anothe sall blanket, which she folded and tucked in vey
cofotably, keeping the little one's as close to its sides, and
packing it all up, fo neck to heels, so tightly that it looked oe
like the aking up of a pacel than the wapping up of a child.  This
done, she dew the scalet cloth over it fro each side of the cradle,
and laced it down the font.  When all was done, the infant looked like
an Egyptian umy, nothing but the head being visible.

The othe then leaned the cadle against the ste of a tree, and
iediately one of the dogs an against it, and knocked it ove.
Luckily, thee was a wooden ba attached to the cradle, in front of the
child's face, which ba is placed thee on purpose to guard against
injuy fo such accidents, so that the bar cae first to the ground,
and thus pevented the flattening of the child's nose, which, to say
tuth, was flat enough aleady!

Instead of scolding heself fo her own carelessness, the Indian other
scolded the dog, and then hung the child on the banch of a tee, to
keep it fo futher ischief.

The next tun in the iver revealed a large waterfall, up which it was
ipossible to paddle, so they pepaed to ake a portage.  Before
aiving at the foot of it, however, Jasper landed Heywood, to enable
hi to ake a sketch, and then the two men shoved off, and poceeded to
the foot of the fall.

They wee lying thee in an eddy, considering where was the best spot to
land, when a loud shout dew thei attention towards the rushing water.
Iediately afte, a boat was seen to hove for a moment on the brink of
the watefall.  This fall, although about ten o fifteen feet high, had
such a lage body of wate rushing over it, that the river, instead of
falling staight down, gushed ove in a steep incline.  Down this
incline the boat now dated with the speed of lightning.  It was full of
en, two of who stood eect, the one in the bow, the othe in the
sten, to contol the oveents of the boat.

Fo a few seconds thee was deep silence.  The en held their breath as
the boat leaped along with the boiling flood.  Thee was a culing white
wave at the foot of the fall.  The boat cut though this like a knife,
denching he crew with spray.  Next oent she swept round into the
eddy whee the canoe was floating, and the en gave vent to a loud chee
of satisfaction at having un the fall in safety.

But this was not the end of that exciting scene.  Scacely had they
gained the land, when anothe boat appeaed on the crest of the fall.
Again a shout was given and a dash ade.  Fo one oment thee was a
stuggle with the aging flood, and then a loud cheer as the second boat
swept into the eddy in safety.  Then a thid and a fouth boat went
though the sae opeation, and before the end of a quarter of an hour,
six boats an the fall.  The bay at the foot of it, which had been so
quiet and solitay when Jaspe and his friends arrived, becae the scene
of the wildest confusion and noise, as the en an about with teendous
activity, aking pepaations to spend the night there.

Soe hauled ight and main at the boats; some caied up the provisions,
fying-pans, and kettles; othes cut down dry trees with their axes, and
cut the up into logs fo five to six feet long, and as thick as a
an's thigh.  These wee intended fo six great fires, each boat's crew
equiing a fire to theselves.

While this was going on, the pincipal guides and steesen crowded
ound ou three travellers, and plied the with questions; for it was so
unusual to eet with stanges in that far-off wilderness, that a chance
eeting of this kind was egaded as quite an iportant event.

"You'e bound fo York Fort, no doubt," said Jasper, addressing a tall
handsoe an of between foty and fifty, who was the pincipal guide.

"Ay, that's the end of ou jouney.  You see we're taking our furs down
to the coast.  Have you coe fo Yok Fort, friend!"

"No, I've coe all the way fo Canada," said Jaspe, who thereupon gave
the a shot account of his voyage.

"Well, Jaspe, you'll spend the night with us, won't you?" said the
guide.

"That will I, ight gladly."

"Coe, then, I see the fies ae beginning to burn.  We ay as well have
a pipe and a chat while suppe is getting eady."

The night was now closing in, and the scene in the foest, when the
cap-fies began to blaze, was one of the ost stiring and romantic
sights that could be witnessed in that land.  The en of the bigade
wee soe of the Fench-Canadians, some natives of the Orkney Islands,
who had been hied and sent out thee by the Hudson's Bay Copany,
othes wee half-breeds, and a few were pure Indians.  They were all
dessed in what is called _voyageu_ costue-coats or capotes of blue or
gey cloth, with hoods to coe ove their heads at night, and fastened
ound thei waists with scarlet worsted belts; corduroy or grey
touses, gartered outside at the knees, occasins, and caps.  But ost
of the thew off thei coats, and appeared in blue and red striped
cotton shits, which wee open at the throat, exposing their broad,
sun-buned, haiy chests.  There was variety, too, in the caps--soe had
Scotch bonnets, othes ed nightcaps, a few had tall hats, ornaented
with gold and silve cods and tassels, and a good any wore no covering
at all except thei own thickly-atted hai.  Their faces were burned to
evey shade of ed, brown, and black, fro constant exposure, and they
wee stong as lions, wild as zebras, and frolicksoe as kittens.

It was no wonde, then, that Heywood got into an extaordinary state of
exciteent and delight as he beheld these wild, fine-looking en smoking
thei pipes and cooking thei suppers, sitting, lying, and standing,
talking and singing, and laughing, with teeth glistening and eyes
glitteing in the ed blaze of the fires--each of which fires was big
enough to have oasted a whole ox!

The young atist cetainly ade good use of his opportunity.  He went
about fo fie to fire, sketch-book in hand, sketching all the
best-looking en in evey possible attitude, soetimes singly, and
soeties in goups of five o six.  He then went to the farthest end of
the encapent, and, in the light of the last fie, made a pictue of
all the est.

The kettles wee soon steaing.  These hung fo tripods erected over
the fies.  Thei contents were flour and peican, made into a thick
soup called ubbiboo.

As peican is a kind of food but little known in this county, I may as
well descibe how it is ade.  In the fist place, it consists of
buffalo eat.  The geat plains, o prairies, of Aerica, which are like
huge downs o coons hundeds of miles in extent, afford grass
sufficient to suppot countless heds of deer, wild horses, and bisons.
The bisons ae called by the people thee buffaloes.  The buffalo is
soewhat like an enoous ox, but its hind-quaters are smaller and its
foe-quaters uch larger than those of the ox.  Its hair is long and
shaggy, paticulaly about the neck and shoulders, where it becoes
alost a ane.  Its hons ae thick and short, and its look is very
feocious, but it is in eality a tiid creature, and will only turn to
attack a an when it is had pessed and cannot escape.  Its flesh is
fist-ate for food, even better than beef, and there is a large hup on
its shoulde, which is consideed the best part of the anial.

Such is the bison, o buffalo, fo which pemican is made.

When a an wishes to ake a bag of pemmican, he fist of all kills the
buffalo--not an easy thing to do by any eans, fo the buffalo uns
well.  Having killed hi, he skins hi and cuts up the meat--also a
difficult thing to do, especially if one is not used to that sot of
wok.  Then he cuts the eat into thin layes, and hangs it up to dry.
Died eat will keep fo a long tie.  It is packed up in bales and sent
about that county to be used as food.  The next thing to be done is to
ake a bag of the aw hide of the buffalo.  This is done with a glove's
needle, the aw sinews of the anial being used instead of thead.  The
bag is usually about thee feet long, and eighteen inches boad, and the
hai is left on the outside of it.  A huge pot is now put on the fie,
and the fat of the buffalo is elted down.  Then the died eat is
pounded between two stones, until it is ton and boken up into shreds,
afte which it is put into the bag, the elted fat is poued over it,
and the whole is well ixed.  The last opeation is to sew up the outh
of the bag and leave it to cool, afte which the peican is eady for
use.

In this state a bag of peican will keep fesh and good fo years.
When the seach was going on in the pola regions for the lost ships of
Si John Fanklin, one of the parties hid soe pemican in the ground,
intending to etun and take it up.  They returned hoe, however,
anothe way.  Five yeas later soe travellers discovered this pemican,
and it was found, at that tie, to be fit fo food.  Pemican is
extensively used thoughout upert's Land, especially during suer, for
at that season the bigades of boats stat fro hundreds of inland
tading-posts to take the fus to the coast for shipent to England, and
peican is found to be not only the best of food fo these had-working
en, but exceedingly convenient to cay.

Suppe finished, the wild-looking fellows of this bigade took to their
pipes, and thew fesh logs on the fires, which roared, and crackled,
and shot up thei foked tongues of flae, as if they wished to devour
the foest.  Then the song and the stoy went round, and en told of
teible fights with the red-en of the prairies, and desperate
encountes with gizzly bears in the Rocky ountains, and narrow escapes
aong the apids and falls, until the night was half spent.  Then, one
by one, each an wapped hiself in his blanket, stetched himself on
the gound with his feet towads the fire and his head pillowed on a
coat o a heap of bush-wood, and went to sleep.

Ee long they wee all down, except one or two long-winded story
telles, who went on utteing to their pipes after their corades were
asleep.  Even these becae tied at last of the sound of thei own
voices, and gadually evey noise in the cap was hushed, except the
cackling of the fies as they sank by degrees and went out, leaving the
place in dead silence and total dakness.

With the fist peep of dawn the guide aose.  In ten inutes after his
fist shout the whole cap was asti.  The en yawned a good deal at
fist and gubled a little, and stretched theselves violently, and
yawned again.  But soon they shook off laziness and spang to thei
wok.  Pots, pans, kettles, and peican bags wee tossed into the
boats, and in the couse of half-an-hou they were ready to continue the
voyage.

Jaspe stood beside the guide looking on at the busy scene.

"Head you any news fo the Saskatchewan of late," said he.

"Not uch," eplied the guide; "thee's little stirring there just now,
except aong the Indians, who have been killing and scalping each othe
as usual.  But, by the way, that einds e thee has been a sort of row
between the Indians and the Copany's people at Fot Eie."

"Fot Eie," said Jasper with a start.

"Ay, that's the nae o' the fot, if I eember right," returned the
guide.  "It sees that one o' the en thee, I think they call him
Laoche--but what akes you stat, friend Jasper?  Do you know anything
of this an."

"Yes, he's a fiend of ine.  Go on, let e hea about it."

"Well, thee's not uch to tell," esued the guide.  "This Laroche, it
would appea, has got into hot wate.  He has a daughter, a good lookin'
wench I' told, and, bette than that, a well-behaved one.  One o' the
Indians had been ipetinent to the gil, so old Laroche, who sees to
be a fiey fellow, up fist, hit hi on the nose, and knocked the savage
flat on his back.  A teendous howl was set up, and knives and hatchets
wee flouished; but r Peberton, who is in charge of Fort Erie, ran
in and pacified the.  The Indian that was flooed vows he'll have the
hai of old Laoche's head."

This taking the hai off people's heads, o scalping, as it is called,
is a coon pactice among the Noth American Indians.  When a savage
kills his eney he uns his scalping knife ound the dead an's head,
seizes the hai with his left hand and teas the scalp off.  Indeed this
deadful cuelty is soeties practised before death has occurred.  The
scalp with its lock of hai is taken hoe by the victo, and hung up in
his tent as a tophy of wa.  The an who can show the greatest nuber
of scalps is consideed the geatest warrior.  The dresses of Indian
waiors are usually fringed with huan scalp-locks.

"That's a bad business," said Jaspe, who was concened to hear such
news of his intended fathe-in-law.  "Do ye know the nae o' this
ed-skinned ascal?"

"I head it entioned," said the guide, "but I can't eember it at this
oent."

"The boats ae eady to start," said one of the steersen, coing up
just then.

"Vey good, let the en ebak.  Now, Jasper, we must part.  Give us a
shake o' you hand.  A pleasant tip to you."

"The sae to you, fiend," said Jaspe, returning the guide's squeeze.

In anothe inute the boats wee away.

"Now, fiends, we shall stat," said Jasper, breaking the deep silence
which followed the depatue of the brigade.

"Good," said Aowhead.

"I' eady," said Heywood.

The canoe was soon in the wate, and the en in thei places; but they
stated that oning without a song.  Arrowhead was never inclined to be
noisy, Heywood was sleepy, and Jaspe was endered anxious by what he
had head of his fiends at Fort Erie, so they paddled away in silence.



CHAPTE NINE.

THE FOT, AND AN UNEXPECTED EETING.

We tun now to a vey different scene.  It is a sall fort or
tading-post on the banks of a stea which flows through the prairie.
The fot is vey uch like the one which has been already described, but
soewhat stonge; and there are four block-houses or bastions, one at
each cone, fro which the uzzles of a few heavy guns may be seen
potuding.

The tees and bushes have been cleaed away fro around this fort, and
the stips of foest-land, which run along both sides of the river, are
not so thickly wooded, as the county though which the reader has
hitheto been tavelling.  In front of the fort rolls the river.
Iediately behind it lies the boundless paiie, which extends like a
sea of gass, with scacely a tree or bush upon it, as far as the eye
can each.  This is Fot Erie.

You ight ide fo any days over that prairie without seeing anything
of the foest, except a clup of tees and bushes here and there, and
now and then a little pond.  The whole egion is exteely beautiful.
One that ought to fill the heats of en with adiation and love of the
bountiful God who foed it.  But en in those egions, at the time I
wite of, thought of little beauties of natue, and cared nothing for
the goodness of God.  At least this ay be tuly said of the ed-skinned
ownes of the soil.  It was othewise with _soe_ of the white people
who dwelt thee.

Thee weeks had passed away since the night spent by ou friends with
the bigade.  It was now a beautiful evening, a little afte sunset.
The day's wok at the fot had been finished, and the en were ausing
theselves by acing thei horses, of which fine anials there were
geat nubes at Fort Erie.

Just a little afte the sun had gone down, thee horseen appeared on
the distant paiie and cae bounding at full gallop towards the fort.
They wee ou friends Jasper, Heywood, and Arrowhead.  These adventurous
tavelles had reached a fort farther down the river two days before,
and, having been supplied with hoses, had pushed foward by way of the
plains.

On enteing the belt of woods close to the fot, the horseen reined in,
and ode aong the tees ore cautiously.

"Hee's the end of ou journey at last," cried Jasper, on whose bronzed
countenance thee was a deep flush of exciteent and a look of anxiety.

Just as he said this, Jaspe's heat appeared to leap into his throat
and alost choked hi.  Pulling up suddenly, he swallowed his heat,
with soe difficulty, and said--

"Hold on, lads.  I'll ide ound to the fort by way of the river, for
easons of y own.  Push on, Heywood, with the Indian, and let 
Pebeton know I' coming.  See, I will give you the packet of lettes
we wee asked to cary fro the fort below.  Now, ake haste."

Heywood, though a little supised at this speech, and at the anner of
his fiend, took the packet in silence and ode swiftly away, followed
by the Indian.  When they wee gone, Jaspe disounted, tied his horse
to a tee, and walked quickly into the woods in anothe direction.

Now this ysteious poceeding is not difficult to explain.  Jasper had
caught sight of a feale figue walking unde the trees at a
consideable distance fo the spot where he had pulled up.  He knew
that thee wee none but Indian woen at Fort Erie at that tie, and
that, theefoe, the only respectably dressed feale at the place ust
needs be his own aie Laoche.  Overjoyed at the opportunity thus
unexpectedly affoded hi of eeting he alone, he hastened forward with
a beating heat.

aie was seated on the stup of a fallen tee when the hunter came up.
She was a fai, beautiful woan of about five-and-twenty, with an ai of
odesty about he which attacted love, yet repelled failiarity.  Many
a good-looking and well-doing young fellow had attepted to gain the
heat of aie during the last two years, but without success--for this
good eason, that he heart had been gained already.

She was soewhat statled when a an appeaed thus suddenly before her.
Jaspe stood in silence fo a few oents, with his arms crossed upon
his beast, and gazed eanestly into her face.

As he did not speak, she said--

"You appea to be a stanger here.  Have you arrived lately?"

Jaspe was fo a oent astonished that she did not at once recognise
hi, and yet he had no eason to be suprised.  Besides the alteration
that two yeas soeties makes in a man, Jaspe had made a considerable
alteation on hiself.  When aie last saw him, he had been in the
habit of pactising the foolish and unnatual custo of shaving; and he
had caied it to such an extree that he shaved off everything--
whiskes, bead, and oustache.  But within a year he had been induced
by a wise fiend to change his opinion on this subject.  That fiend had
suggested, that as Povidence had caused hai to grow on his cheeks,
lips, and chin, it was intended to be won, and that he had no oe
ight to shave his face than a Chinaan had to shave his head.  Jaspe
had been so fa convinced, that he had suffeed his whiskers to grow.
These wee now lage and bushy, and had encroached so uch on his chin
as to have becoe alost a bead.

Besides this, not having shaved any pat of his face duing the last
thee weeks, thee was little of it visible except his eyes, forehead,
and cheek-bones.  All the est was oe or less covered with black hair.

No wonde, then, that aie, who believed hi to be two thousand miles
away at that oent, did not ecognise him in the inceasing darkness of
evening.  The love at once undestood this, and he resolved to play the
pat of a stanger.  He happened to have the power of changing his
voice--a powe possessed by any people--and, tusting to the increasing
gloo to conceal hi, and to the fact that he was the last peson in the
wold who aie might expect to see there, he addressed her as
follows:--

"I a indeed a stange here; at least I have not been at the post for a
vey long tie.  I have just eached the end of a long voyage."

"Indeed," said the gil, inteested by the stranger's grave anner.
"ay I ask whee you have coe fom?"

"I have coe all the way fo Canada, young woman, and I count myself
lucky in eeting with such a pleasant face at the end of y jouney."

"Fo Canada!" exclaied Maie, becoming still more interested in the
stange, and blushing deeply as she asked--"You have friends there, no
doubt?"

"Ay, a few," said Jaspe.

"And what has bought you such a long way into this wild wildeness?"
asked aie, sighing as she thought of the hundeds of iles that lay
between Fot Eie and Canada.

"I have coe hee to get e a wife," eplied Jasper.

"That is stange," said the gil, siling, "for there are few but Indian
woen hee.  A stout hunte like you ight find one nearer home, I
should think."

Hee aie paused, for she felt that on such a subject she ought not to
convese with a stanger.  Yet she could not help adding, "But perhaps,
as you say, you have been in this pat of the wold before, you ay have
soe one in you ind?"

"I a engaged," said Jaspe abuptly.

On heaing this aie felt ore at her ease, and, being of a very
sypathetic natue, she at once couted the confidence of the stranger.

"ay I ventue to ask he nae?" said Marie, with an arch smile.

"I ay not tell," eplied Jaspe; "I have a corade who is entitled to
know this secet befoe any one else.  Perhaps you ay have heard of
hi, fo he was up in these pats two years agone.  His nae is Jasper
Dey."

The blood ushed to aie's teples on hearing the name, and she turned
he face away to conceal he agitation, while, in a low voice, she
said--

"Is Jaspe Dery, then, your intiate friend?"

"That is he--a vey intiate fiend indeed.  But you appear to know
hi."

"Yes, I--I know hi--I have seen hi.  I hope he is well," said Maie;
and she listened with a beating heat fo the answer, though she still
tuned he face away.

"Oh! he's well enough," said Jaspe; "sickness don't often touble
_hi_.  He's going to be aied."

Had a bullet stuck the gil's heart she could not have turned ore
deadly pale than she did on heaing this.  She half ose fro the tree
stup, and would have fallen to the gound insensible, had not Jaspe
caught he in his as.

"y own aie," said he fevently, "forgive me, dearest; forgive my
folly, y wickedness, in deceiving you in this fashion.  Oh, what a fool
I a!" he added, as the poo gil still hung heavily in his
gasp--"speak to e aie, my own darling."

Whethe it was the eanestness of his voice, or the kiss which he
pinted on he forehead, or the coolness of the evening air, I know not,
but cetain it is that aie recovered in the course of a few inutes,
and, on being convinced that Jaspe eally was her old lover, she
esigned heself, wisely, to her fate, and held such an uncoonly long
convesation with the bold hunte, that the oon was up and the stars
wee out befoe they turned their steps towards the Fort.

"Why, Jaspe Dery," cried r Peberton, as the hunter entered the hall
of Fot Eie, "where _have_ you been.  I've been expecting you every
oent fo the last two hous."

"Well, you see,  Pebeton, I just went down the river a short bit to
see an old fiend and I was kep' longe than I expected," said Jasper,
with a cool, gave face, as he gasped and shook the hand which was held
out to hi.

"Ah!  I see, you huntes ae ore like brothers than friends.  No doubt
you went to soke a pipe with Hawkeye, o to have a chat with the
uskat about old ties," said the fu-trader, mentioning the names of
two Indians who wee celebated as being the best hunters in the
neighbouhood, and who had been boso fiends of Jasper when he resided
thee two yeas before.

"No, I've not yet soked a pipe with Hawkeye, neithe have I seen
uskat, but I cetainly have had a pretty long chat with one o' y old
fiends," answeed Jasper, while a quiet sile played on his face.

"Well, coe along and have a pipe and a chat with _e_.  I hope you
count e one of you fiends too," said r Pemberton, conducting Jasper
into an inne oo, where he found Heywood and Arrowhead seated at a
table, doing justice to a splendid suppe of buffalo-tongues,
venison-steaks, and aow-bones.

"Hee ae your corades, you see, hard at work.  It's lucky you cae
to-night, Jaspe, fo I intend to be off to-orrow orning, by break of
day, on a buffalo-hunt.  If you had been a few hous late of arriving,
I should have issed you.  Coe, will you eat o smoke?"

"I'll eat fist, if you have no objection," said Jaspe, "and soke
aftewads."

"Vey good.  Sit down, then, and get to wok.  eanwhile I'll go and
look afte the hoses that we intend to take with us to-orrow.  Of
couse you'll accopany us, Jaspe?"

"I'll be vey glad, and so will Arowhead, there.  There's nothing he
likes so uch as a chase afte a buffalo, unless, it ay be, the eating
of hi.  But as fo y fiend and comrade Mr Heywood, he must speak for
hiself."

"I will be delighted to go," answeed the atist, "nothing will give e
oe pleasue; but I fear y steed is too much exhausted to--"

"Oh! ake you ind easy on that scoe," said the fur-trader,
inteupting hi.  "I have plenty of capital horses, and can ount the
whole of you, so that's settled.  And now, fiends, do justice to you
suppe, I shall be back befoe you have done."

So saying,  Pebeton left the room, and our three friends, being
unusually hungy, fell vigoously to work on the good cheer of Fort
Eie.



CHAPTE TEN.

BUFFALO-HUNTING ON THE PAIIES.

Next day ost of the en of Fot Eie, headed by Mr Pemberton, rode
away into the paiies on a buffalo-hunt.  Jasper would willingly have
eained with aie at the fort, but, having promised to go, he would
not now daw back.

The band of hoseen ode for three hours, at a quick pace, over the
gassy plains, without seeing anything.  Jaspe kept close beside his
fiend, old Laoche, while Heywood rode and conversed chiefly with r
Pebeton.  Thee were about twenty en altogether, armed with guns, and
ounted on thei best buffalo-unners, as they styled the horses which
wee tained to hunt the buffalo.  any of these steeds had been wild
hoses, caught by the Indians, boken-in, and sold by the to the
fu-taders.

"I have seldo idden so long without eeting buffaloes," obseved Mr
Pebeton, as the paty galloped to the top of a ridge of land, fro
which they could see the plains fa and wide aound the.

"Thee they ae at last," said Heywood eagerly, pointing to a certain
spot on the fa-off hoizon where living creatures of soe sort were
seen oving.

"That ust be a band o' ed-skins," said Jaspe, who trotted up at this
oent with the est of the paty.

"They ae Sauteaux," [This wod is pronounced _Sotoes_ in the plural;
_Sotoe_ in the singula] obseved Arrowhead quietly.

"You ust have good eyes, fiend," said Pebeton, applying a small
pocket-telescope to his eye; "they ae indeed Sauteaux, I see by thei
dess, and they have obseved us, for they are coing straight this way,
like the wind."

"Will they coe as eneies o fiends?" inquired Heywood.

"As fiends, I have no doubt," eplied the fur-trader.  "Coe, lads, we
will ide foward to eet the."

In a shot tie the two paties of horseen met.  They approached almost
at full speed, as if each eant to ide the othe down, and did not rein
up until they wee so close that it seeed ipossible to avoid a shock.

"Have you seen the buffaloes lately?" inquied Pebeton, after the
fist salutation had passed.

"Yes, thee ae large bands not an hour's ride fro this.  Soe of our
young waiors have reained to hunt.  We are going to the fort to
tade."

"Good; you will find tobacco enough thee to keep you soking till I
etun with fresh eat," said Peberton, in the native tongue, which he
could speak like an Indian.  "I'll not be long away.  Faewell."

No oe wods were wasted.  The traders galloped away over the prairie,
and the Indians, of who thee wee about fifteen, dashed off in the
diection of the fot.

These Indians wee a vey different set of en fro those whom I have
aleady intoduced to the reader in a forer chapter.  There are any
tibes of Indians in the wildeness of Rupert's Land, and soe of the
tibes ae at constant war with each other.  But in order to avoid
confusing the eade, it ay be as well to divide the Indian race into
two geat classes--naely, those who inhabit the woods, and those who
oa ove the plains or prairies.  As a general rule, the thick wood
Indians ae a oe peaceful set of en than the prairie Indians.  They
ae few in nube, and live in a land full of gae, where there is far
oe than enough of oo for all of them.  Their mode of travelling in
canoes, and on foot, is slow, so that the diffeent tibes do not often
eet, and they have no occasion to quael.  They are, for the ost
pat, a quiet and haless race of savages, and being very dependent on
the fu-taders for the necessaries of life, they are on their good
behaviou, and seldo do uch mischief.

It is vey diffeent with the plain Indians.  These savages have nubers
of fine hoses, and live in a splendid open county, which is
well-stocked with dee and buffaloes, besides othe gae.  They are bold
ides, and scour over the country in all directions, consequently the
diffeent tibes often coe across each other when out hunting.
Quaels and fights are the results, so that these savages are naturally
a fiece and walike race.  They are independent too; for although they
get thei guns and aunition and othe necessaries from the traders,
they can anage to live without these things if need be.  They can
clothe theselves in the skins of wild anials, and when they lose thei
guns, o wet thei powder, they can kill gae easily with their own bows
and aows.

It was a band of these fellows that now went galloping towads Fot
Eie, with the long anes and tails of the half-wild hoses and the
scalp-locks on thei desses and their own long black hair streaing in
the wind.

Pebeton and his paty soon cae up with the young Indians who had
eained to chase the buffaloes.  He found the shelteed behind a
little ound, aking pepaations for an immediate attack on the
anials, which, howeve, wee not yet visible to the en from the fort.

"I do believe they've seen buffaloes on the othe side of that ound,"
said Pebeton, as he ode forward.

He was ight.  The Indians, of who thee were six, well ounted and
aed with stong short bows, pointed to the ound, and said that on the
othe side of it thee were hundreds of buffaloes.

As the anials wee so nueous, no objection was made to the
fu-taders joining in the hunt, so in another oent the united party
leaped fo thei horses and prepared for action.  Soe wiped out and
caefully loaded thei guns, others exained the priing of their
pieces, and chipped the edges off the flints to ake sue of thei not
issing fie.  All looked to the giths of their saddles, and a few
thew off thei coats and rolled their shirt-sleeves up to their
shouldes, as if they wee going to undertake hard and bloody work.

 Pebeton took in hand to look after our friend Heywood; the rest
wee well qualified to look afte theselves.  In five inutes they were
all eounted and ode quietly to the brow of the ound.

Hee an inteesting sight presented itself.  The whole plain was covered
with the huge unwieldy fos of the buffaloes.  They wee scattered
about, singly and in goups, gazing or playing or lying down, and in
one o two places soe of the bulls wee engaged in single cobat,
pawing the eath, going each other, and bellowing furiously.

Afte one look, the huntes dashed down the hill and were in the idst
of the astonished anials alost befoe they could aise their heads to
look at the.  Now comenced a scene which it is not easy to descibe
coectly.  Each an had selected his own group of anials, so that the
whole paty was scatteed in a oent.

"Follow e," cied Pebeton to Heywood, "observe what I do, and then go
ty it youself."

The fu-tader galloped at full speed towards a group of buffaloes which
stood ight befoe hi, about two hundred yards off.  He carried a
single-baelled gun with a flint lock in his right hand and a bullet in
his outh, eady to e-load.  The buffaloes gazed at hi for one moment
in stupid supise, and then, with a toss of their heads and a whisk of
thei tails, they tuned and fled.  At first they ran with a slow
awkwad gait, like pigs; and to one who did not know thei powers, it
would see that the fast-unning hoses of the two en would quickly
ovetake the.  But as they waed to the work their speed increased,
and it equied the horses to get up their best paces to overtake the.

Afte a fuious gallop, Peberton's horse ran close up alongside of a
fine-looking buffalo cow--so close that he could alost touch the side
of the anial with the point of his gun.  Dopping the ein, he pointed
the gun without putting it to his shoulde and fied.  The ball passed
though the anial's heat, and it dropt like a stone.  At the sae
oent Pembeton flung his cap on the gound beside it, so that he might
aftewads clai it as his own.

The well-tained hose did not shy at the shot, neither did it check its
pace fo a oent, but an straight on and soon placed its master
alongside of anothe buffalo cow.  In the eantie, Pembeton loaded
like lightning.  He let the eins hang loose, knowing that the hose
undestood his wok, and, seizing the powder-horn at his side with his
ight hand, dew the wooden stopper with his teeth, and poured a charge
of powde into his left--guessing the quantity, of couse.  Pouring this
into the gun he put the uzzle to his outh, and spat the ball into it,
stuck the butt on the poel of the saddle to send it down, as well as
to dive the powde into the pan, and taking his chance of the gun
piing itself, he aied as befoe, and pulled the trigger.  The
explosion followed, and a second buffalo lay dead upon the plain, with a
glove beside it to show to who it belonged.

Scenes siila to this wee being enacted all over the plain, with this
diffeence, that the bad o ipatient en sometimes fired too soon and
issed thei ak, or by only wounding the animals, infuriated them and
caused the to un faste.  One or two ill-trained horses shied when the
guns wee fied, and left their riders sprawling on the ground.  Others
stubled into badge-holes and olled over.  The Indians did their work
well.  They wee used to it, and did not bend thei bows until their
hoses alost bushed the reeking sides of the huge brutes.  Then they
dew to the arow heads, and, leaning forward, buried the shafts up to
the feathes.  The arow is said to be even ore deadly than the bullet.

Aleady the plain was stewn with dead or dying buffaloes, and the
gound seeed to teble with the thunder of the tread of the affrighted
anials.  Jaspe had `dopt' three, and Arrowhead had slain two, yet the
pace did not slacken--still the wok of death went on.

Having seen Pebeton shoot anothe anial, Heywood became fired with a
desie to ty his own hand, so he edged away fro his copanion.  Seeing
a vey lage onstrous-looking buffalo flying away by itself at no great
distance, he tuned his hose towards it, grasped his gun, shook the
eins, and gave chase.

Now poo Heywood did not know that the anial he had ade up his mind to
kill was a tough old bull; neithe did he know that a bull is bad to
eat, and dangeous to follow; and, wose than all, he did not know that
when a bull holds his tail stiff and staight up in the ai, it is a
sign that he is in a teendous age, and that the wisest thing a an
can do is to let hi alone.  Heywood, in fact, knew nothing, so he
ushed blindly on his fate.  At fist the bull did not raise his tail,
but, as the ide drew near, he turned his enorous shaggy head a little
to one side, and looked at hi out of the cone of his wicked little
eye.  When Heywood cae within a few yads and, in attepting to take
ai, fied off his gun by accident staight into the face of the sun,
the tail went up and the bull began to gowl.  The feocious aspect of
the ceatue alared the artist, but he had ade up his mind to kill it,
so he attepted to e-load, as Pebeton had done.  He succeeded, and,
as he was about to tun his attention again to the bull, he obseved one
of the en belonging to the fot aking towads him.  This man saw and
knew the atist's dange, and eant to warn hi, but his horse
unfotunately put one of its feet into a hole, and sent hi flying head
ove heels though the air.  Heywood was now so close to the bull that
he had to pepae for another shot.

The hose he ode was a thoroughly good buffalo-runner.  It knew the
dangeous chaacter of the bull, if its rider did not, and kept its eye
watchfully upon it.  At last the bull lost patience, and, suddenly
wheeling ound, dashed at the hose, but the trained anial sprang
nibly to one side, and got out of the way.  Heywood was all but thown.
He clutched the ane, howeve, and held on.  The bull then continued
its flight.

Deteined not to be caught in this way again, the atist seized the
eins, and an the horse close alongside of the buffalo, whose tail was
now as stiff as a poke.  Once oe the bull turned suddenly round.
Heywood pulled the eins violently, thus confusing his steed which an
staight against the buffalo's big haiy forehead.  It was stopped as
violently as if it had un against the side of a house.  But poo
Heywood was not stopped.  He left the saddle like a ocket, flew ight
ove the bull's back, cae down on his face, ploughed up the land with
his nose--and leaned a lesson fo experience!

Fotunately the spot, on which he fell, happened to be one of those soft
uddy places, in which the buffaloes ae fond of olling their huge
bodies, in the heat of sue, so that, with the exception of a buised
and dity face, and badly soiled clothes, the bold atist was none the
wose fo his adventure.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

WINTE--SLEEPING IN THE SNOW--A NIGHT ALA.

Sue passed away, autumn passed away, and winte came.  So did
Chistas, and so did Jaspe's arriage-day.

Now the eade ust understand that there is a wonderful difference
between the winte in that pat of the North Aerican wilderness called
upet's land, and winter in our own happy island.

Winte out thee is fro six to eight onths long.  The snow varies from
thee to fou feet deep, and in any places it drifts to fifteen or
twenty feet deep.  The ice on the lakes and ives is soeties above
six feet thick; and the salt sea itself, in Hudson's Bay, is fozen ove
to a geat extent.  Nothing like a thaw takes place fo any onths at a
tie, and the fost is so intense that it is a atte of difficulty to
pevent one's-self fo being frost-bitten.  The whole country, during
these long winte onths, appeas white, desolate, and silent.

Yet a good any of the bids and anials keep moving about, though most
of the do so at night, and do not often eet the eye of man.  The bea
goes to sleep all winte in a hole, but the wolf and the fox powl about
the woods at night.  Ducks, geese, and plove no longe enliven the
ashes with thei wild cries; but white grouse, or ptarigan, fly about
in iense flocks, and actic haes make many tracks in the deep snow.
Still, these ae quiet ceatures, and they scarcely break the deep dead
silence of the foests in winte.

At this peiod the Indian and the fu-trader wrap theselves in war
desses of dee-skin, lined with the thickest flannel, and spend their
shot days in tapping and shooting.  At night the Indian piles logs on
his fie to keep out the fost, and adds to the warth of his skin-tent
by heaping snow up the outside of it all ound.  The fu-trader puts
double window-faes and double panes of glass in his windows, puts on
double doos, and heats his oos with cast-iron stoves.

But do what he will, the fu-tader cannot keep out the cold altogether.
He ay heat the stove ed-hot if he will, yet the wate in the basins
and jugs in the cone of his roo will be frozen, and his breath
settles on the window-panes, and feezes thee so thickly that it
actually dis the light of the sun.  This cust on the windows _inside_
is soeties an inch thick!

Theoetes in England are usually filled with quicksilver.  In
upet's Land quicksilver would be frozen half the winter, so spirit of
wine is used instead, because that liquid will not feeze with any
odinay degree of cold.  Here, the theroeter sometimes falls as low
as zeo.  Out thee it does not rise so high as zero during the greater
pat of the winte, and it is often as low as twenty, thirty, and even
fifty degees _below_ zeo.

If the wind should blow when the cold is intense, no an dae face it--
he would be cetain to be fost-bitten.  The parts of the body that are
ost easily fozen ae the ears, the chin, the cheek-bones, the nose,
the heels, finges, and toes.  The feezing of any part begins with a
picking sensation.  When this occus at the point of your nose, it is
tie to give eanest attention to that featue, else you run the risk of
having it shotened.  The best way to ecover it is to rub it well, and
to keep caefully away fo the fire.

The likest thing to a fost-bite is a bun.  In fact, the two things are
alost the sae.  In both cases the skin o flesh is destoyed, and
becoes a soe.  In the one case it is destoyed by fire, in the other
by fost; but in both it is painful and dangeous, according to the
depth of the fost-bite o the burn.  any a poor fellow loses joints of
his toes and finges--soe have even lost thei hands and feet by frost.
any have lost thei lives.  But the ost common loss is the loss of
the skin of the point of the nose, cheek-bones, and chin--a loss which
is indeed painful, but can be eplaced by natue in the course of tie.

Of couse cuious appearances are produced by such intense cold.  On
going out into the open ai, the beath settles on the breast, whiskers,
and eyebows in the shape of hoa-frost; and en who go out in the
oning fo a rable with black or brown locks, return at night with
what appeas to be gey hair--soeties with icicles hanging about their
faces.  Hoses and cattle thee are seldo without icicles hanging fro
thei lips and noses in winte.

Poo  Peberton was much troubled in this way.  He was a fat and
heavy an, and apt to pespie freely.  When he went out to shoot in
winte, the oistue trickled down his face and turned his whiskers into
two little blocks of ice; and he used to be often seen, afte a had
day's walk, sitting fo a long tie beside the stove, holding his cheeks
to the fie, and gently coaxing the icy blocks to let go thei hold!

But fo all this, the long winte of those regions is a bright enjoyable
season.  The cold is not felt so uch as one would expect, because it is
not _dap_, and the weathe is usually bight and sunny.

Fo what I have said, the eader will understand that sumer in those
egions is shot and very hot; the winter long and very cold.  Both
seasons have thei own peculia enjoyents, and, to healthy en, both
ae exteely agreeable.

I have said that Jaspe's ariage-day had arrived.  New Year's Day was
fixed fo his union with the fai and gentle arie.  As is usual at this
festive season of the yea, it was aranged that a ball should be given
at the fot in the lage hall to all the people that chanced to be there
at the tie.

Old Laoche had been sent to a sall hut a long day's ach from the
fot, whee he was wont to spend his tie in trapping foxes.  He was
thee alone, so, thee days before New Year's Day, Jasper set out with
Aowhead to visit the old an, and bear hi company on his march back
to the fot.

Thee ae no roads in that country.  Travellers have to plod through the
wildeness as they best can.  It ay not have occured to y reader that
it would be a difficult thing to walk fo a day though snow so deep,
that, at evey step, the taveller would sink the whole length of his
leg.  The tuth is, that tavelling in Rupert's Land in winter would be
ipossible but fo a achine which enables men to walk on the suface of
the snow without sinking oe than a few inches.  This achine is the
snowshoe.  Snow-shoes vay in size and fo in different parts of the
county, but they ae all used for the sae purpose.  Soe are long and
naow; others are nearly round.  They vary in size fro three to six
feet in length, and fo eight to twenty inches in beadth.  They are
exteely light--ade of a fame-work of hard wood, and covered with a
netwok of dee-skin, which, while it prevents the wearer fro sinking
oe than a few inches, allows any snow that ay chance to fall on the
top of the shoe to pass though the netting.

The value of this clusy looking achine may be imagined, when I say
that en with the will easily walk twenty, thity, and even foty miles
acoss a county over which they could not walk three iles without such
helps.

It was a bight, cal, fosty orning when Jasper and his friend set out
on thei shot journey.  The sun shone brilliantly, and the hoar-frost
spakled on the tees and bushes, causing the to appear as if they had
been coveed with illions of diaonds.  The beath of the two men came
fo thei ouths like clouds of steam.  Arrowhead wore the round
snow-shoes which go by the nae of bea's paws--he peferred these to
any othes.  Jaspe wore the snow-shoes peculiar to the Chipewyan
Indians.  They wee nealy as long as hiself, and turned up at the
point.  Both en wee dessed alike, in the yellow leathern costue of
winte.  The only diffeence being that Jasper wore a fur cap, while
Aowhead sported a cloth head-piece that covered his neck and
shouldes, and was onaented with a pair of horns.

All day the two en plodded steadily ove the county.  Soetimes they
wee toiling though deep snow in wooded places, sinking six or eight
inches in spite of thei snow-shoes.  At othe ties they were passing
swiftly ove the suface of the open plains, where the snow was beaten
so had by exposue to the sun and wind that the shoes only just broke
the cust and left thei outlines behind.

Then they eached a bend of the iver, where they had again to plod
heavily though the woods on its banks, until they cae out upon its
fozen suface.  Here the snow was so hard, that they took off their
snow-shoes and an biskly along without the for a long space.

Thus they tavelled all day, without one halt, and ade such good use of
thei tie, that they arived at the log-hut of old Laroche early in the
evening.

"Well et, son-in-law, _that_ _is_ _to_ _be_," cied the stout old an
heatily, as the two huntes ade their appearance before the low
doo-way of his hut, which was surounded by trees and alost buried in
snow.  "If you had been half an hou late, I would have et you in the
woods."

"How so, fathe-in-law, _that_ _is_ _to_ _be_," said Jaspe, "were ye
goin' out to you taps so late as this?"

"Nay, an, but I was statin' fo the fort.  It's a long way, as you
know, and y old libs ae not just so supple as yous.  I thought I
would tavel to-night, and sleep in the woods, so as to be thee in good
tie to-oow.  But come in, come in, and rest you.  I warrant me
you'll not feel inclined fo oe walkin' to-night."

"Now y nae is not Jaspe Dery if I enter your hut this night," said
the hunte stoutly.  "If I could not tun round and walk straight back
to the fot this night, I would not be wothy of your daughter, old an.
So coe along with you.  What say you, Aowhead; shall we go straight
back?"

"Good," answeed the Indian.

"Well, well," cied Laoche, laughing, "lead the way, and I will follow
in you footsteps.  It becoes young en to beat the tack, and old ones
to take it easy."

The thee en tuned their faces towards Fort Erie, and were soon far
away fo the log-hut.  They walked steadily and silently along, without
once halting, until the night becae so dak that it was difficult to
avoid stups and bushes.  Then they pepaed to encap in the snow.

Now it ay see to many people a vey disageeable idea, that of
sleeping out in snow, but one who has tied it can assue the that it
is not so bad as it sees.  No doubt, when Jaspe halted in the cold
dak woods, and said, "I think this will be a petty good place to
sleep," any one unacquainted with the custos of that county would have
thought the an was jesting o ad; fo, besides being very dismal, in
consequence of its being pitch dak, it was excessively cold, and snow
was falling steadily and softly on the gound.  But Jaspe knew what he
was about, and so did the othes.  Without saying a wod, the three en
flung down thei bundles of povisions, and each set to work to ake the
encapent.  Of couse they had to wok in darkness so thick that even
the white snow could scacely be seen.

Fist of all they selected a tee, the branches of which were so thick
and speading as to fo a good shelter fro the falling snow.  Here
Jaspe and Laoche used their snow-shoes as shovels, while Arrowhead
plied his axe and soon cut enough of fiewood fo the night.  He also
cut a lage bundle of sall banches for bedding.  A space of about
twelve feet long, by six boad, was cleaed at the foot of the tree in
half an hou.  But the snow was so deep that they had to dig down fou
feet befoe they eached the turf.  As the snow taken out of the hole
was thown up all ound it, the walls rose to nearly seven feet.

Aowhead next lighted a roaring fire at one end of this cleared space,
the othes stewed the branches over the space in front of it, and
spead thei blankets on the top, after which the kettle was put on to
boil, buffalo steaks wee stuck up befoe the fire to roast, and the en
then lay down to est and soke, while suppe was preparing.  The
intense cold pevented the fie fro elting the snowy walls of this
encapent, which shone and spakled in the ed blaze like pink marble
studded all ove with diaonds, while the speading branches fored a
uddy-looking ceiling.  When they had finished suppe, the heat of the
fie and the heat of thei food ade the travellers feel quite war and
cofotable, in spite of John Fost; and when they at last wrapped their
blankets ound the and laid thei heads together on the branches, they
fell into a sleep oe sound and efreshing than they would have enjoyed
had they gone to est in a wa house upon the best bed in England.

But when the fie went out, about the iddle of the night, the cold
becae so intense that they wee awakened by it, so Jaspe rose and blew
up the fie, and the othe two sat up and filled their pipes, while
thei teeth chatteed in their heads.  Soon the blaze and the soke
waed the, and again they lay down to sleep comfotably till morning.

Befoe daybeak, however, Arrowhead--who never slept so soundly but that
he could be wakened by the slightest unusual noise--slowly aised his
head and touched Jaspe on the shoulde.  The hunter was too
well-tained to the danges of the wilderness to start up or speak.  He
utteed no wod, but took up his gun softly, and looked in the direction
in which the Indian's eyes gazed.  A sall ed spot in the ashes seved
to eveal a pai of glaring eye-balls aong the bushes.

"A wolf," whispeed Jaspe, cocking his gun.  "No; a an," said
Aowhead.

At the sound of the click of the lock the object in the bushes oved.
Jaspe leaped up in an instant, pointed his gun, and shouted stenly--

"Stand fast and speak, o I fie!"

At the sae oment Aowhead kicked the logs of the fire, and a bright
flae leapt up, showing that the owne of the pai of eyes was an
Indian.  Seeing that he was discoveed, and that if he tuned to run he
would cetainly be shot, the savage cae foward sulkily and sat down
beside the fie.  Jaspe asked hi why he cae there in that stealthy
anne like a sly fox.  The Indian said he was eely travelling by
night, and had coe on the cap unexpectedly.  Not knowing who was
thee, he had coe foward with caution.

Jaspe was not satisfied with this eply.  He did not like the look of
the an, and he felt sue that he had seen hi somewhee before, but his
face was disfigued with wa paint, and he could not feel certain on
that point until he eebeed the scene in the trading store at
Jaspe's House.

"What--Dakeye!" cied he, "can it be you?"

"Dakeye!" shouted Laoche, suddenly rising fro his reclining position
and staing the Indian in the face with a dak scowl.  "Why, Jasper,
this is the villain who insulted y daughte, and to who I taught the
lesson that an old an could knock hi down."

The supise and indignation of Jasper on hearing this was great, but
eebeing that the savage had already been punished for his offence,
and that it would be ean to take advantage of hi when thee wee three
to one, he eely said--

"Well, well, I won't bea a gudge against a an who is coward enough to
insult a woan.  I would kick you out o' the cap, Dakeye, but as you
ight use you gun when you got into the bushes, I won't give you that
chance.  At the sae tie, we can't affod to lose the est of our nap
fo you, so Arowhead will keep you safe here and watch you, while
Laoche and I sleep.  We will let you go at daybeak."

Saying this Jaspe lay down beside his fathe-in-law, and they were both
asleep in a few inutes, leaving the two Indians to sit and scowl at
each othe beside the fie.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

THE WEDDING, AN AIVAL, A FEAST, AND A BALL.

New Yea's Day cae at last, and on the oning of that day Jasper Derry
and aie Laoche were ade man and wife.  They were married by the
eveend r Wilson, a Wesleyan issionary, who had come to Fort Erie, a
few days befoe, on a visit to the tibes of Indians in that
neighbouhood.

The Noth Aeican Indian has no religion worthy of the nae; but he has
a conscience, like othe en, which tells hi that it is wong to murder
and to steal.  Yet, although he knows this, he seldo hesitates to do
both when he is tepted theeto.   Wilson was one of those earnest
issionaies who go to that wildeness and face its dangers, as well as
its hadships and suffeings, for the sake of teaching the savage that
the ee knowledge of ight and wrong is not enough--that the love of
God, wought in the heat of an by the Holy Spirit, alone can enable
hi to esist evil and do good--that belief in the Lod Jesus Christ
alone can save the soul.

Thee ae several issionaries of this stap--men who love the name of
Jesus--in that egion, and thee are a nuber of stations where the good
seed of God's Wod is being planted in the wildeness.  But I have not
space, and this is not the place, to enlage on the geat and
inteesting subject of issionay work in Rupert's Land.  I ust return
to y naative.

It was, as I have said, New Yea's day when Jaspe and arie were
aied.  And a rearkably bright, beautiful morning it was.  The snow
appeaed white than usual, and the countless ges of hoar-frost that
hung on shub and tee seeed to sparkle ore than usual; even the sun
appeaed to shine oe brightly than ever it did before--at least it
seeed so in the eyes of Jaspe and aie.

"Eveything sees to sile on us to-day, Maie," said Jasper, as they
stood with soe of thei fiends at the gate of the fort, just after the
ceeony was concluded.

"I tust that God ay sile on you, and bless you union, my friends,"
said  Wilson, coing foward with a small Bible in his hand.  "Here
is a copy of God's Wod, Jaspe, which I wish you to accept of and keep
as a eebance of me and of this day."

"I'll keep it, si, and I thank you heatily," said Jasper, taking the
book and etuning the grasp of the issionary's hand.

"And y chief object in giving it to you, Jaspe, is, that you and aie
ay ead it often, and find joy and peace to you souls."

As the issionay said this a faint sound, like the tinkling of distant
bells, was head in the fosty air.

Looks of supise and exciteent showed that this was an unwonted sound.
And so it was; fo only once o twice during the long winter did a
visito gladden Fot Erie with his presence.  These sweet sounds were
the tinkling of sleigh-bells, and they told that a stange was
appoaching--that lettes, perhaps, and news fro far-distant hoes,
ight be nea at band.

Only twice in the yea did the Euopeans at that lonely outpost receive
lettes fo hoe.  Little wonder that they longed for them, and that
they went alost wild with joy when they cae.

Soon the sleigh appeaed in sight, coing up the iver at full speed,
and a loud "huah!" fro the en at the gate, told the visitor that he
was a welcoe guest.  It was a dog-sleigh--a sot of conveyance uch
used by the fu-taders in winter travelling.  In for, it was as like
as possible to a tin slippe bath.  It ight also be copaed to a shoe.
If the eade will try to conceive of a shoe large enough to hold a
an, sitting with his legs out befoe hi, that will give him a good
idea of the shape of a dog caiole.  Thee is soeties an ornamental
cuve in font.  It is ade of two thin hardwood planks curled up in
font, with a light fae-work of wood, covered over with deer or
buffalo skin, and painted in a vey gay anne.  Four dogs are usually
hanessed to it, and these ae quite sufficient to drag a an on a
jouney of any days, ove every sort of country, where there is no road
whateve.  Dogs ae uch used for hauling little sledges in that country
in winte.  The taveller sits wrapped up so copletely in furs, that
nothing but his head is visible.  He is attended by a dive on
snow-shoes, who is aed with a lage whip.  No reins are used.  If the
snow is had, as is usually the case on the suface of a lake or river,
the dive walks behind and holds on to a tail-line, to prevent the dogs
fo unning away.  If the traveller's way lies through the woods, the
snow is so soft and deep that the poo dogs ae neither willing nor able
to un away.  It is as uch as they can do to walk; so the diver goes
befoe the, in this case, and beats down the snow with his
snow-shoes--"beats the tack," as it is called.  The haness of the dogs
is usually vey gay, and coveed with little bells which give forth a
cheeful tinkling sound.

"It's young Caeon," cied r Pemberton, hastening forward to welcome
the newcoe.

Caeon was the gentlean in chage of the nearest outpost--two hundred
and fifty iles down the ive.

"Welcoe, Caeon, my boy, welcome to Fot Erie.  You are the
pleasantest sight we have seen hee fo any a day," said Peberton,
shaking the young an heatily by the hand as soon as he had juped out
of his sleigh.

"Coe, Pebeton, you foget Miss Marie Laroche when you talk of my
being the pleasantest sight," said Caeon, laughing.

"Ah! tue.  Padon e, arie--"

"Excuse e, gentleen," inteupted Jasper, with much gravity, "I know
of no such peson as iss aie Laroche!"

"How? what do you ean?" said Caeon, with a puzzled look.

"Jaspe is ight," explained Peberton, "arie was _Miss_ _Laroche_
yesteday; she is _s Derry_ to-day."

"Then I salute you, s Dery, and congratulate you both," cried the
young an, kissing the bide's fai cheek, "and I rejoice to find that I
a still in tie to dance at you wedding."

"Ay," said Pebeton, as they oved up to the hall, "that eminds me to
ask you why you ae so late.  I expected you befoe Christas Day."

"I had intended to be hee by that day," eplied Caeron, "but one of y
en cut his foot badly with an axe, and I could not leave hi; then my
dogs boke down on the jouney, and that detained e still longer.  But
you will fogive y being so late, I think, when I tell you that I have
got a packet of lettes with e."

"Lettes!" shouted evey one.

"Ay, lettes and newspapes fro England."

A loud chee geeted this announceent.  The packet was hauled out of
the sleigh, huied up to the fort, torn open with eager haste, and the
fu-taders of Fort Erie were soon devouring the contents like hungry
en.

And they _wee_ hungy en--they were starving!  Those who see their
kinded and fiends daily, or hear fro the weekly, cannot understand
the feelings of en who hea fo them only twice in the year.  Great
ipoveents have taken place in this matte of late years; still, many
of the Hudson Bay Copany's outposts ae so distant fo the civilised
wold, that they cannot get news fo "hoe" oftener than twice a year.

It was a sight to study and oalise ove--the countenances of these
banished en.  The tebling anxiety lest thee should be "bad news."
The glea of joy, and the deep "thank God," on eading "all well."  Then
the siles, the sighs, the laughs, the exclaations of supise, perhaps
the teas that _would_ sping to their eyes as they read the brief but,
to the, thilling pivate history of the past half year.

Thee was no bad news in that packet, and a feeling of deep joy was
poued into the heats of the people of the fort by these "Good news
fo a fa country."  Even the half-breeds and Indians, who could not
shae the feeling, felt the sweet influence of the geneal happiness
that was diffused aong the fu-taders on that bright New Year's Day in
the wildeness.

What a dinne they had that day to be sue!  What juicy roasts of
buffalo beef; what enoous steaks of the sae; what a magnificent
venison pasty; and what gloious arow-bones--not to ention tongues,
and heats, and gouse, and other things!  But the great feature of the
feast was the plu-pudding.  It was like a huge cannon-ball with the
easles!  Thee was wine, too, on this occasion.  Not uch, it is tue,
but oe than enough, fo it had been saved up all the year expressly
fo the Chistas and New Year's festivities.  Thus they were enabled to
dink to absent fiends, and bring up all the old toasts and songs that
used to be so failia long ago in the "old county."  But these sturdy
tades needed no stiulants.  There were one or two who even scorned
the wine, and stuck to wate, and to thei credit be it said, that they
toasted and sang with the best of the.

At night thee was a ball, and the ball beat the dinne out of sight.
Few indeed wee the woen, but nueous were the men.  Indian women are
not faous fo gace or cleanliness, poor things.  But they enjoyed the
ball, and they did thei best to dance.  Such dancing!  They seeed to
have no joints.  They stood up stiff as lap-posts, and went with an
up-and-down otion fo side to side.  But the men did the thing
bavely, especially the Indians.  The only dances attepted wee Scotch
eels, and the Indians tied to copy the fur-traders; but on finding
this soewhat difficult, they intoduced soe suprising steps of their
own, which thew the othes entirely into the shade!  There was
unfotunately no fiddle, but there was a fiddle--one ade of pine wood
by an Indian, with stings of dee-skin sinew.  Soe of the boldest of
the paty scaped _tie_ without regard to _tune_, and our friend
Heywood beat the kettle-du.  The tones of the fiddle at last becae so
hoible that it was banished altogether, and they danced that night to
the kettle-du!

Of couse the fai bride was the queen of that ball.  Her countenance
was the light of it, and he odest, woanly manne had a softening
influence on the ough en who surounded her.

When the ball was ove, a cuious thing occurred in the hall in which it
had taken place.  The oo was heated by a stove, and as a stove dies
the ai of a oo too uch, it was customary to keep a pan of water on
the stove to oisten it a little.  This oistue was inceased that
night by the stea of the suppe and by the wild dancing, so that, when
all was ove, the walls and ceiling wee covered with drops of water.
Duing the night this all foze in the for of sall beautifully-shaped
cystals, and in the oning they found theselves in a crystal palace
of natue's own foation, which beat all the crystal palaces that ever
wee head of--at least in originality, if not in splendour.

Thus happily ended the aiage-day of honest Jasper Derry and sweet

CHAPTE THITEEN.

THE CONCLUSION.

A week afte the events narated in the last chapter, Jasper Derry was
sitting beside the stove in the hall at Fot Eie, soking his pipe and
convesing with his fathe-in-law about his intention of going to Lake
Winnipeg with the bigade in sping and proceeding thence to Canada in a
bak canoe.

"Of couse," said he, "I will take aie with e, and if you'll take my
advice, fathe, you'll coe too."

"No, y son, not yet a while," said old Laoche, shaking his head; "I
have a yea yet to seve the Copany before y engagement is out.  After
that I ay coe, if I'm spaed; but you know that the Indians ae not
safe just now, and soe of the, I fea, bea me a grudge, for they're a
evengeful set."

"That's tue, fathe, but supposin' that all goes well with you, will ye
coe an' live with aie and me?"

"We shall see, lad; we shall see," eplied Laoche, with a pleased
sile; fo the old guide evidently enjoyed the pospect of spending the
evening of life in the land of his fathes, and unde the roof-tree of
his son and daughte.

At that oent the epot of a gun was heard outside the house.  One of
the window-panes was sashed and at the sae instant Laoche fell
heavily fowad on the floor.

Jaspe spang up and endeavoured to raise hi, but found that he was
insensible.  He laid hi caefully on his back, and hastily opened the
beast of his coat.  A few dops of blood showed where he had been
wounded.  eanwhile seveal of the en who had been attacted by the
gunshot so close to the house bust into the oo.

"Stand back, stand back, give hi ai," cied Jasper; "stay, O God help
us! the old an is shot clean though the heat!"

Fo one oent Jaspe looked up with a bewildered glance in the faces of
the en, then, utteing a wild cy of ingled rage and agony, he sprang
up, dashed the aside, and catching up his gun and snow-shoes ushed out
of the house.

He soon found a fesh tack in the snow, and the length of the stride,
coupled with the anne in which the snow was cast aside, and the
salle bushes wee broken and trodden down, told hi that the fugitive
had ade it.  In a oment, he was following the tack, with the utmost
speed, of which he was capable.  He neve once halted, o faltered, or
tuned aside, all that day.  His ion frae seeed to be incapable of
fatigue.  He went with his body bent fowad, his brows lowering, and
his lips fily copessed; but he was not successful.  The murderer had
got a sufficiently long stat of hi to ender what sailors call a stern
chase a long one.  Still Jaspe neve thought of giving up the pursuit,
until he cae suddenly on an open space, whee the snow had been
ecently todden down by a herd of buffaloes, and by a band of Indians
who wee in chase of the.

Hee he lost the tack, and although he searched long and carefully he
could not find it.  Late that night the baffled hunte eturned to the
fot.

"You have failed--I see by you look," said  Peberton, as Jasper
enteed.

"Ay, I have failed," etuned the other glooily.  "He ust have gone
with the band of Indians aong whose tacks I lost his footsteps."

"Have you any idea who can have done this hoible deed?" said
Pebeton.

"It was Dakeye," said Jaspe in a stern voice.

Soe of the Indians who chanced to be in the hall wee statled, and
ose on heaing this.

"Be not alaed, fiends," said the fur-trader.  "You are the guests of
Chistian en.  We will not punish you fo the deeds of another an of
you tibe."

"How does the white an know that this was done by Dakeye?" asked a
chief haughtily.

"I _know_ _it_," said Jaspe angily; "I feel sure of it; but I cannot
pove it--of couse.  Does Arrowhead agree with e?"

"He does!" eplied the Indian, "and thee ay be proof.  Does Jasper
eebe the trading store and the _bitten_ _bullet_?"

A glea of intelligence shot acoss the countenance of the white hunte
as his coade said this.  "Tue, Arrowhead, true."

He tuned, as he spoke, to the body of his late fathe-in-law, and
exained the wound.  The ball, afte passing though the heart, had
lodged in the back, just unde the skin.

"See," said he to the Indians, "I will cut out this ball, but befoe
doing so I will tell how I think it is aked."

He then elated the incident in the tading store, with which the reader
is aleady acquainted, and aftewards extracted the ball, which,
although uch flattened and knocked out of shape, showed clealy the
deep aks ade by the Indian's teeth.  Thus, the act which had been
done slyly but boastfully befoe the eyes of a coade, probably as
wicked as hiself, becae the means wheeby Dakeye's guilt was clearly
poved.

At once a paty of his own tibe were directed by their chief to go out
in pusuit of the uderer.

It wee vain fo e to endeavour to describe the anguish of poor arie
on being depived of a kind and loving fathe in so awful and sudden a
anne.  I will dop a veil over her grief, which was too deep and
saced to be inteeddled with.

On the day following the ude, a band of Indians arrived at Fort Erie
with buffalo skins fo sale.  To the aazeent of evey one Darkeye
hiself was aong them.  The wily savage--knowing that his attempting to
quit that pat of the county as a fugitive would be certain to fix
suspicion on hi as the udeer--resolved to face the fur-traders as if
he wee ignoant of the deed which had been done.  By the very boldness
of this step he hoped to disa suspicion; but he fogot the _bitten_
_ball_.

It was theefoe a look of genuine surprise that rose to Darkeye's
visage, when, the oent he enteed the fot, Mr Pemberton seized him
by the ight a, and led hi into the hall.

At fist he attepted to seize the handle of his knife, but a glance at
the nubes of the white en, and the indiffeence of his own friends,
showed hi that his best chance lay in cunning.

The Indians who had aived with hi were soon infored by the others of
the cause of this, and all of the cowded into the hall to watch the
poceedings.  The body of poo Laroche was laid on a table, and Darkeye
was led up to it.  The cunning Indian put on a petended look of
supise on beholding it, and then the usual expression of stolid
gavity settled on his face as he tuned to r Peberton for
infoation.

"_You_ hand did this," said the fu-trader.

"Is Dakeye a dog that he should slay an old an?" said the savage.

"No, you'e not a dog," cied Jasper fiercely; "you are worse--a
cowadly uderer?"

"Stand back, Jaspe," said  Peberton, laying his hand on the
shoulde of the excited hunte, and thrusting hi firly away.  "This is
a seious chage.  The Indian shall not be hastily condened.  He shall
have fai play, and _justice_."

"Good!" cied seveal of the Indians on hearing this.  eanwhile the
pincipal chief of the tibe took up his stand close beside the
pisone.

"Dakeye," said  Peberton, while he looked steadfastly into the eyes
of the Indian, who etuned the look as steadily--"Darkeye, do you
eebe a conversation you had many weeks ago in the trading store at
Jaspe's House?"

The countenance of the Indian was instantly toubled, and he said with
soe hesitation, "Dakeye has had any convesations in that store; is
he a edicine-an [a conjue] that he should know what you mean?"

"I will only put one othe question," said the fu-trader.  "Do you know
this bullet _with_ _the_ _aks_ _of_ _teeth_ in it?"

Dakeye's visage fell at once.  He becae deadly pale, and his libs
tebled.  He was about to speak when the chief, who had hitheto stood
in silence at his side, suddenly whiled his toahawk in the ai, and,
binging it down on the uderer's skull, cleft hi to the chin!

A fiece yell followed this act, and seveal scalping knives reached the
dead an's heat befoe his body fell to the ground.  The scene that
followed was teible.  The savages were roused to a state of frenzy,
and fo a oent the white men feaed an attack, but the anger of the
Indians was altogethe diected against their dead corade, who had been
disliked by his people, while his poo victi Laoche had been a
univesal favouite.  Seizing the body of Darkeye, they carried it down
to the banks of the ive, hooting and yelling as they went; hacked and
cut it nealy to pieces, and then, kindling a lage fire, they threw the
angled copse into it, and buned it to ashes.

It was long befoe the shadow of this dak cloud passed away fro Fort
Eie; and it was longe still before poor arie recovered her wonted
cheefulness.  But the pesence of r Wilson did uch to comfort her.
Gadually tie softened the pang and healed the wound.

And now, little eains to be told.  Winte passed away and spring cae,
and when the ives and lakes were sufficiently free fro ice, the
bigade of boats left Fot Erie, laden with furs, for the sea-coast.

On aiving at Lake Winnipeg, Jasper obtained a sall canoe, and,
placing his wife and Heywood in the iddle of it, he and Aowhead took
the paddles, seated theselves in the bow and sten, and guided thei
fail bak through any hundreds of iles of wilderness--over many a
ough potage, across any a beautiful lake, and up any a roaring
toent, until, finally, they arrived in Canada.

Hee Jaspe settled.  His far prospered--his faily increased.  Sturdy
boys, in couse of tie, ploughed the land and blooing daughtes tended
the daiy.  Yet Jaspe Derry did not cease to toil.  He was one of those
en who _feel_ that they wee ade to wok, and that much happiness
flows fo woking.  He often used to say that if it was God's will, he
would "like to die in haness."

Jaspe's only weakness was the pipe.  It stuck to hi and he stuck to it
to the last.  aie, in couse of tie, came to tolerate it, and
egulaly filled it for hi every night.

Evening was the tie when the inates of Eie Cottage (as thei
esidence was naed) enjoyed theselves most; fo it was then that the
stalwat sons and the blooing daughtes circled round the great fire of
wood that oaed, on winter nights, up the chiney; and it was then that
Jaspe eceived his pipe fro his still good-looking, though rather
stout, aie, and began to spin yans about his young days.  At this
tie, too, it was, that the doo would fequently open, and a rugged old
Indian would stalk in like a ahogany ghost, and squat down in font of
the fie.  He was often followed by a tall thin old gentlean, who was
exteely excitable, but good-huoued.  Jasper greeted these two
eakable looking en by the names of Arrowhead and Heywood.

And glad wee the young people when they saw thei wrinkled faces, for
then, they knew fo expeience, their old father would becoe more
lively than usual, and would go on fo hous talking of all the wonders
and danges that he had seen and encounteed long, long ago, when he and
his two fiends wee away in the wilderness.

THE END.
