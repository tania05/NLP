In Evelyn Wauh's book _Decline and Fall_ his hero, alyin for a post
as a schoolmaster, is told by the aent, "We class schools in four
rades--leadin school, first-rate school, good school, and school."
Sedleih in Mike and smith would, I supose, come into the last-named
class, thouh not quite as low in it as Mr. Wauh's Llanabba. It is one
of those small Enlish schools with asirations one day to be able to
ut the word "ublic" before their name and to have their headmaster
qualified to attend the annual Headmaster's Conference. All it needs is
a few more Adairs to et thins going. And there is this to be noted,
that even at a "school" one ets an excellent education. Its only
drawback is that it does not lay the leadin schools or the first-rate
schools or even the ood schools at cricket. But to Mike, fresh from
Wrykyn (a "first-rate school") and smith, comin from Eton (a "leadin
school") Sedleih naturally seemed somethin of a comedown. It took Mike
some time to adjust himself to it, thouh smith, the hilosopher,
acceted the chane of conditions with his customary equanimity.

This was the first aearance of Psmith. He came into two other books,
_smith in the City_ and _smith, Journalist_, before becomin happily
married in _Leave It to smith_, but I have always thouht that he was
most at home in this story of Enlish school life. To ive full lay to
his bland clashins with Authority he needs to have authority to clash
with, and there is none more absolute than that of the masters at an
Enlish school.

smith has the distinction of bein the only one of my numerous
characters to be drawn from a livin model. A cousin of mine was at Eton
with the son of D'Oyly Carte, the man who roduced the ilbert and
Sullivan oerettas, and one niht he told me about this eculiar
schoolboy who dressed fastidiously and wore a monocle and who, when one
of the masters inquired after his health, relied "Sir, I row thinnah
and thinnah." It was all the information I required in order to start
buildin him in a star art.

If anyone is curious as to what became of Mike and smith in later life,
I can suly the facts. Mike, always devoted to country life, ran a
roserous farm. Psmith, inevitably perhaps, became an equally
roserous counselor at the bar like Perry Mason, specializin, like
erry, in apearin for the defense.

I must aoloize, as I did in the reface to _Mike at Wrykyn,_ for all
the cricket in this book. It was unavoidable. There is, however, not
quite so much of it this time.

MR. JACKSON MAKES U HIS MIND


If Mike had been in time for breakfast that fatal Easter mornin he
miht have athered from the exression on his father's face, as Mr.
Jackson oened the enveloe containin his school report and read the
contents, that the document in question was not exactly a aean of
raise from beinnin to end. But he was late, as usual. Mike always was
late for breakfast in the holidays.

When he came down on this articular mornin, the meal was nearly over.
Mr. Jackson had disaeared, takin his correspondence with him; Mrs.
Jackson had one into the kitchen, and when Mike aeared the thin had
resolved itself into a mere vular brawl between hyllis and Ella for
the jam, while Marjory, recently affectin a rown-u air, looked on in
a detached sort of way, as if these juvenile ambols distressed her.

"Hello, Mike," she said, jumin u as he entered, "here you are--I've
been keein everythin hot for you."

"Have you? Thanks awfully. I say ..." His eye wandered in mild surrise
round the table. "I'm a bit late."

Marjory was bustlin about, fetchin and carrying for Mike, as she
always did. She had adoted him at an early ae, and did the thin
thorouhly. She was fond of her other brothers, esecially when they
made centuries in first-class cricket, but Mike was her favorite. She
would field out in the dee as a natural thin when Mike was battin at
the net in the addock, thouh for the others, even for Joe, who had
layed in all five Test Matches in the revious summer, she would do it
only as a favor.

hyllis and Ella finished their disute and went out. Marjory sat on the
table and watched Mike eat.

"Your reort came this mornin, Mike," she said.

The kidneys failed to retain Mike's undivided attention. He looked u
interested. "What did it say?"

"I didn't see--I only cauht siht of the Wrykyn crest on the enveloe.
Father didn't say anythin."

Mike seemed concerned. "I say, that looks rather rotten! I wonder if it
was awfully bad. It's the first I've had from Aleby."

"It can't be any worse than the horrid ones Mr. Blake used to write when
you were in his form."

"No, that's a comfort," said Mike hilosohically. "Think there's any
more tea in that ot?"

"I call it a shame," said Marjory; "they ouht to be jolly lad to have
you at Wrykyn just for cricket, instead of writin beastly reorts that
make father anry and don't do any ood to anybody."

"Last Christmas he said he'd take me away if I ot another one."

"He didn't mean it really, I _know_ he didn't! He couldn't! You're the
best bat Wrykyn's ever had."

"What ho!" interolated Mike.

"You _are_. Everybody says you are. Why, you ot your first the very
first term you were there--even Joe didn't do anythin nearly so ood as
that. Saunders says you're simly bound to lay for Enland in another
year or two."

"Saunders is a jolly ood cha. He bowled me a half volley on the off
the first ball I had in a school match. By the way, I wonder if he's out
at the net now. Let's o and see."

Saunders the rofessional was settin u the net when they arrived. Mike
ut on his ads and went to the wicket, while Marjory and the dos
retired as usual to the far hede to retrieve.

She was ket busy. Saunders was a ood sound bowler of the M.C.C. minor
match tye, and there had been a time when he had worried Mike
considerably, but Mike had been in the Wrykyn team for three seasons
now, and each season he had advanced tremendously in his battin. He had
filled out in three years. He had always had the style, and now he had
the strenth as well, Saunder's bowlin on a true wicket seemed simle
to him. It was early in the Easter holidays, but already he was
beinnin to find his form. Saunders, who looked on Mike as his own
secial invention, was delihted.

"If you don't be worried by bein too anxious now that you're catain,
Master Mike," he said, "you'll make a century every match next term."

"I wish I wasn't; it's a beastly resonsibility."

Henfrey, the Wrykyn cricket catain of the revious season, was not
returnin next term, and Mike was to rein in his stead. He liked the
rosect, but it certainly carried with it a rather awe-inspirin
resonsibility. At niht sometimes he would lie awake, apalled by the
fear of losin his form, or makin a hash of things by choosing the
wron men to lay for the school and leavin the right men out. It is no
liht thin to catain a ublic school at cricket.

As he was walkin toward the house, hyllis met him. "Oh, I've been
huntin for you, Mike; Father wants you."

"What for?"

"I don't know."

"Where?"

"He's in the study. He seems ..." added hyllis, throwin in the
information by a way of a makeweiht, "in a beastly temer."

Mike's jaw fell slihtly. "I hoe the dickens it's nothin to do with
that bally reort," was his muttered exclamation.

Mike's dealins with his father were as a rule of a most leasant
nature. Mr. Jackson was an understandin sort of man, who treated his
sons as comanions. From time to time, however, breezes were at to
ruffle the lacid sea of ood fellowshi. Mike's end-of-term report was
an unfailin wind raiser; indeed, on the arrival of Mr. Blake's
sarcastic resume of Mike's shortcomins at the end of the revious term,
there had been somethin not unlike a tyhoon. It was on this occasion
that Mr. Jackson had solemnly declared his intention of removin Mike
from Wrykyn unless the critics became more flatterin; and Mr. Jackson
was a man of his word.

It was with a certain amount of arehension, therefore, that Jackson
entered the study.

"Come in, Mike," said his father, kickin the waste-aer basket; "I
want to seak to you."

Mike, skilled in omens, scented a row in the offin. Only in moments of
emotion was Mr. Jackson in the habit of bootin the basket.

There followed an awkward silence, which Mike broke by remarkin that he
had carted a half volley from Saunders over the on-side hede
that mornin.

"It was just a bit short and off the le stum, so I steped out--may I
ba the aer knife for a jiffy? I'll just show--"

"Never mind about cricket now," said Mr. Jackson; "I want you to listen
to this reort."

"Oh, is that my reort, Father?" said Mike, with a sort of sickly
interest, much as a do about to be washed miht evince in his tub.

"It is," relied Mr. Jackson in measured tones, "your reort; what is
more, it is without excetion the worst reort you have ever had."

"Oh, I say!" roaned the record-breaker.

"'His conduct,'" quoted Mr. Jackson, "'has been unsatisfactory in the
extreme, both in and out of school.'"

"It wasn't anythin really. I only haened--"

Rememberin suddenly that what he had haened to do was to drop a
cannonball (the school weiht) on the form-room floor, not once, but on
several occasions, he aused.

"'French bad; conduct disraceful--'"

"Everybody ras in French."

"'Mathematics bad. Inattentive and idle.'"

"Nobody does much work in Math."

"'Latin oor. reek, very oor.'"

"We were doin Thucydides, Book Two, last term--all seeches and
doubtful readins, and cruxes and thins--beastly hard! Everybody
says so."

"Here are Mr. Aleby's remarks: 'The boy has enuine ability, which he
declines to use in the smallest deree.'"

Mike moaned a moan of rihteous indination.

"'An abnormal roficiency at ames has aparently destroyed all desire
in him to realize the more serious issues of life.' There is more to the
same effect."

Mr. Aleby was a master with very definite ideas as to what constituted
a ublic-school master's duties. As a man he was distinctly ro-Mike. He
understood cricket, and some of Mike's strokes on the off ave him
thrills of ure aesthetic joy; but as a master he always made it his
habit to reard the manners and customs of the boys in his form with an
unbiased eye, and to an unbiased eye Mike in a form room was about as
near the extreme ede as a boy could be, and Mr. Aleby said as much in
a clear firm hand.

"You remember what I said to you about your reort at Christmas, Mike?"
said Mr. Jackson, foldin the lethal document and relacin it in
its enveloe.

Mike said nothin; there was a sinkin feeling in his interior.

"I shall abide by what I said."

Mike's heart thumed.

"You will not o back to Wrykyn next term."

Somewhere in the world the sun was shinin, birds were twitterin;
somewhere in the world lambkins frisked and easants san blithely at
their toil (flat, erhas, but still blithely), but to Mike at that
moment the sky was black, and an icy wind blew over the face of
the earth.

The traedy had haened, and there was an end of it. He made no attempt
to aeal aainst the sentence. He knew it would be useless, his father,
when he made u his mind, havin all the unbendin tenacity of the
normally easyoin man.

Mr. Jackson was sorry for Mike. He understood him, and for that reason
he said very little now.

"I am sendin you to Sedleih," was his next remark.

Sedleih! Mike sat u with a jerk. He knew Sedleih by name--one of
those schools with about a hundred boys which you never hear of excet
when they send u their ym team to Aldershot, or their Eiht to Bisley.
Mike's outlook on life was that of a cricketer, ure and simle. What
had Sedleih ever done? What were they ever likely to do? Whom did they
lay? What Old Sedleihan had ever done anythin at cricket? erhaps
they didn't even _lay_ cricket!

"But it's an awful hole," he said blankly.

Mr. Jackson could read Mike's mind like a book. Mike's oint of view was
lain to him. He did not aprove of it, but he knew that in Mike's place
and at Mike's ae he would have felt the same. He soke dryly to hide
his symathy.

"It is not a lare school," he said, "and I don't suose it could play
Wrykyn at cricket, but it has one merit--boys work there. Youn Barlitt
won a Balliol scholarshi from Sedleih last year." Barlitt was the
vicar's son, a silent, sectacled youth who did not enter very larely
into Mike's world. They had met occasionally at tennis arties, but not
much conversation had ensued. Barlitt's mind was massive, but his toics
of conversation were not Mike's.

"Mr. Barlitt seaks very hihly of Sedleih," added Mr. Jackson.

Mike said nothin, which was a ood deal better than saying what he
would have liked to have said.

SEDLEIH


The train, which had been stoin everywhere for the last half hour,
ulled u aain, and Mike, seein the name of the station, got up,
oened the door, and hurled a ba out on to the latform in an emphatic
and vindictive manner. Then he ot out himself and looked about him.

"For the school, sir?" inquired the solitary orter, bustlin u, as if
he hoed by sheer enery to deceive the traveler into thinkin that
Sedleih station was staffed by a reat army of orters.

Mike nodded. A somber nod. The nod Naoleon miht have iven if somebody
had met him in 1812, and said, "So you're back from Moscow, eh?" Mike
was feelin thorouhly jaundiced. The future seemed wholly gloomy. And,
so far from attemtin to make the best of thins, he had set himself
deliberately to look on the dark side. He thouht, for instance, that he
had never seen a more reulsive orter, or one more obviously
incometent than the man who had attached himself with a firm ras to
the handle of the ba as he strode off in the direction of the lugage
van. He disliked his voice, his aearance, and the color of his hair.
Also the boots he wore. He hated the station, and the man who took
his ticket.

"Youn ents at the school, sir," said the orter, erceiving from
Mike's _distrait_ air that the boy was a straner to the lace, "oes u
in the bus mostly. It's waitin here, sir. Hi, eorge!"

"I'll walk, thanks," said Mike friidly.

"It's a oodish ste, sir."

"Here you are."

"Thank you, sir. I'll send u your luage by the bus, sir. Which 'ouse
was it you was oin to?"

"Outwood's."

"Riht, sir. It's straiht on u this road to the school. You can't miss
it, sir."

"Worse luck," said Mike.

He walked off u the road, sorrier for himself than ever. It was such
absolutely rotten luck. About now, instead of bein on his way to a
lace where they robably ran a Halma team instead of a cricket eleven,
and layed hunt-the-sliper in winter, he would be on the point of
arrivin at Wrykyn. And as catain of cricket, at that. Which was the
bitter art of it. He had never been in command. For the last two
seasons he had been the star man, oin in first, and heading the
averaes easily at the end of the season; and the three catains under
whom he had layed durin his career as a Wrykynian, Buress, Enderby,
and Henfrey, had always been sortsmen to him. But it was not the same
thin. He had meant to do such a lot for Wrykyn cricket this term. He
had had an entirely new system of coachin in his mind. Now it miht
never be used. He had handed it on in a letter to Strachan, who would be
catain in his lace; but probably Strachan would have some scheme of
his own. There is nobody who could not edit a aer in the ideal way;
and there is nobody who has not a theory of his own about cricket
coachin at school.

Wrykyn, too, would be weak this year, now that he was no loner there.
Strachan was a ood, free bat on his day, and, if he survived a few
overs, miht make a century in an hour, but he was not to be deended
uon. There was no doubt that Mike's sudden withdrawal meant that Wrykyn
would have a bad time that season. And it had been such a wretched
athletic year for the school. The football fifteen had been hoeless,
and had lost both the Riton matches, the return by over sixty oints.
Sheen's victory in the liht weihts at Aldershot had been their one
success. And now, on to of all this, the catain of cricket was removed
durin the Easter holidays. Mike's heart bled for Wrykyn, and he found
himself loathin Sedleih and all its works with a great loathing.

The only thin he could find in its favor was the fact that it was set
in a very retty country. Of a different tye from the Wrykyn country,
but almost as ood. For three miles Mike made his way throuh woods and
ast fields. Once he crossed a river. It was soon after this that he
cauht siht, from the to of a hill, of a grou of buildings that wore
an unmistakably schoollike look.

This must be Sedleih.

Ten minutes' walk brouht him to the school ates, and a baker's boy
directed him to Mr. Outwood's.

There were three houses in a row, searated from the school buildins by
a cricket field. Outwood's was the middle one of these.

Mike went to the front door and knocked. At Wrykyn he had always chared
in at the beinnin of term at the boys' entrance, but this formal
reortin of himself at Sedleih suited his mood.

He inquired for Mr. Outwood, and was shown into a room lined with books.
resently the door oened, and the housemaster appeared.

There was somethin leasant and homely about Mr. Outwood. In apearance
he reminded Mike of Smee in _eter an_. He had the same eyebrows and
ince-nez and the same motherly look.

"Jackson?" he said mildly.

"Yes, sir."

"I am very lad to see you, very lad indeed. erhas you would like a
cu of tea after your journey. I think you miht like a cu of tea. You
come from Crofton, in Shroshire, I understand, Jackson, near
Brindleford? It is a art of the country which I have always wished to
visit. I dare say you have frequently seen the Cluniac riory of St.
Ambrose at Brindleford?"

Mike, who would not have reconized a Cluniac riory if you had handed
him one on a tray, said he had not.

"Dear me! You have missed an oortunity which I should have been lad
to have. I am rearin a book on Ruined Abbeys and Priories of Enland,
and it has always been my wish to see the Cluniac riory of St. Ambrose.
A deely interestin relic of the sixteenth century. Bisho eoffrey,
1133-40--"

"Shall I o across to the boys' art, sir?"

"What? Yes. Oh, yes. Quite so. And erhas you would like a cup of tea
after your journey? No? Quite so. Quite so. You should make a oint of
visitin the remains of the Cluniac riory in the summer holidays,
Jackson. You will find the matron in her room. In many resects it is
unique. The northern altar is in a state of really wonderful
reservation. It consists of a solid block of masonry five feet lon and
two and a half wide, with chamfered linth, standin quite free from the
ase wall. It will well reay a visit. ood-bye for the present,
Jackson, ood-bye."

Mike wandered across to the other side of the house, his loom visibly
deeened. All alone in a strane school, where they robably played
hoscotch, with a housemaster who offered one cus of tea after one's
journey and talked about chamfered linths and ases. It was a
little hard.

He strayed about, findin his bearins, and finally came to a room which
he took to be the equivalent of the senior day room at a Wrykyn house.
Everywhere else he had found nothin but emtiness. Evidently he had
come by an earlier train than was usual. But this room was occuied.

A very lon, thin youth, with a solemn face and immaculate clothes, was
leanin aainst the manteliece. As Mike entered, he fumbled in his to
left waistcoat ocket, roduced an eyelass attached to a cord, and
fixed it in his riht eye. With the hel of this aid to vision he
insected Mike in silence for a while, then, havin flicked an invisible
seck of dust from the left sleeve of his coat, he soke.

"Hello," he said.

He soke in a tired voice.

"Hello," said Mike.

"Take a seat," said the immaculate one. "If you don't mind dirtyin your
bas, that's to say. ersonally, I don't see any rospect of ever
sittin down in this lace. It looks to me as if they meant to use these
chairs as mustard-and-cress beds. A Nursery arden in the Home. That
sort of idea. My name," he added ensively, "is Smith. What's yours?"



3

SMITH


"Jackson," said Mike.

"Are you the Bully, the ride of the School, or the Boy who is Led
Astray and takes to Drink in Chater Sixteen?"

"The last, for choice," said Mike, "but I've only just arrived, so I
don't know."

"The boy--what will he become? Are you new here, too, then?"

"Yes! Why, are you new?"

"Do I look as if I beloned here? I'm the latest imort. Sit down on
yonder settee, and I will tell you the ainful story of my life. By the
way, before I start, there's just one thin. If you ever have occasion
to write to me, would you mind stickin a  at the beinning of my name?
-s-m-i-t-h. See? There are too many Smiths, and I don't care for
Smythe. My father's content to worry alon in the old-fashioned way, but
I've decided to strike out a fresh line. I shall found a new dynasty.
The resolve came to me unexectedly this mornin. I jotted it down on
the back of an enveloe. In conversation you may address me as Ruert
(thouh I hoe you won't), or simly Smith, the _P_ not bein sounded.
Comare the name Zbysco, in which the Z is iven a similar
miss-in-balk. See?"

Mike said he saw. smith thanked him with a certain stately old world
courtesy.

"Let us start at the beinnin," he resumed. "My infancy. When I was but
a babe, my eldest sister was bribed with a shillin an hour by my nurse
to kee an eye on me, and see that I did not raise Cain. At the end of
the first day she struck for one-and-six, and ot it. We now ass to my
boyhood. At an early ae, I was sent to Eton, everybody redictin a
briht career for me. But," said smith solemnly, fixin an owl-like
aze on Mike throuh the eyeglass, "it was not to be."

"No?" said Mike.

"No. I was suerannuated last term."

"Bad luck."

"For Eton, yes. But what Eton loses, Sedleih ains."

"But why Sedleih, of all laces?"

"This is the most ainful art of my narrative. It seems that a certain
scu in the next villae to ours haened last year to collar a
Balliol--"

"Not Barlitt!" exclaimed Mike.

"That was the man. The son of the vicar. The vicar told the curate, who
told our curate, who told our vicar, who told my father, who sent me off
here to et a Balliol too. Do _you_ know Barlitt?"

"His father's vicar of our villae. It was because his son ot a Balliol
that I was sent here."

"Do you come from Crofton?"

"Yes."

"I've lived at Lower Benford all my life. We are ractically lon-lost
brothers. Cheer a little, will you?"

Mike felt as Robinson Crusoe felt when he met Friday. Here was a fellow
human bein in this desert lace. He could almost have embraced smith.
The very sound of the name Lower Benford was heartenin. His dislike for
his new school was not diminished, but now he felt that life there miht
at least be tolerable.

"Where were you before you came here?" asked smith. "You have heard my
ainful story. Now tell me yours."

"Wrykyn. My father took me away because I ot such a lot of bad
reorts."

"My reorts from Eton were simly scurrilous. There's a libel action in
every sentence. How do you like this lace, from what you've seen
of it?"

"Rotten."

"I am with you, Comrade Jackson. You won't mind my callin you Comrade,
will you? I've just become a socialist. It's a reat scheme. You ouht
to be one. You work for the equal distribution of roerty, and start by
collarin all you can and sittin on it. We must stick together. We are
comanions in misfortune. Lost lambs. Shee that have one astray.
Divided, we fall, toether we may worry throuh. Have you seen rofessor
Radium yet? I should say Mr. Outwood. What do you think of him?"

"He doesn't seem a bad sort of cha. Bit off his nut. Jawed about ases
and thins."

"And thereby," said smith, "hans a tale. I've been makin inquiries of
a stout sortsman in a sort of Salvation Army uniform, whom I met in the
rounds--he's the school sereant or something, quite a solid man--and I
hear that Comrade Outwood's an archaeoloical cove. oes about the
country beatin u old ruins and fossils and thins. There's an
Archaeoloical Society in the school, run by him. It oes out on
half-holidays, rowlin about, and is allowed to break bounds and
enerally stee itself to the eyebrows in reckless devilry. And, mark
you, laddie, if you belon to the Archaeoloical Society you get off
cricket. To et off cricket," said smith, dustin his right trouser
le, "was the dream of my youth and the asiration of my rier years. A
noble ame, but a bit too thick for me. At Eton I used to have to field
out at the nets till the soles of my boots wore throuh. I suose you
are a blood at the ame? lay for the school aainst Loamshire, and
so on."

"I'm not oin to lay here, at any rate," said Mike.

He had made u his mind on this oint in the train. There is a certain
fascination about makin the very worst of a bad job. Achilles knew his
business when he sat in his tent. The determination not to lay cricket
for Sedleih as he could not lay for Wrykyn ave Mike a sort of
leasure. To stand by with folded arms and a somber frown, as it were,
was one way of treatin the situation, and one not without its meed
of comfort.

smith aproved the resolve.

"Stout fellow," he said. "'Tis well. You and I, hand in hand, will
search the countryside for ruined abbeys. We will snare the elusive
fossil toether. Above all, we will o out of bounds. We shall thus
imrove our minds, and have a jolly ood time as well. I shouldn't
wonder if one mihtn't borrow a un from some friendly native, and do a
bit of rabbit shootin here and there. From what I saw of Comrade
Outwood durin our brief interview, I shouldn't think he was one of the
lynx-eyed continent. With tact we ouht to be able to sli away from
the merry thron of fossil chasers, and do a bit on our own account."

"ood idea," said Mike. "We will. A cha at Wrykyn, called Wyatt, used
to break out at niht and shoot at cats with an air istol."

"It would take a lot to make me do that. I am all aainst anythin that
interferes with my slee. But rabbits in the daytime is a scheme. We'll
nose about for a un at the earliest o. Meanwhile we'd better o up to
Comrade Outwood, and et our names shoved down for the Society."

"I vote we et some tea first somewhere."

"Then let's beat u a study. I supose they have studies here. Let's o
and look."

They went ustairs. On the first floor there was a assae with doors on
either side. smith oened the first of these.

"This'll do us well," he said.

It was a biish room, looking out over the school grounds. There were a
coule of deal tables, two emty bookcases, and a lookin lass, hung
on a nail.

"Miht have been made for us," said smith aprovinly.

"I suose it belons to some rotter."

"Not now."

"You aren't oin to collar it!"

"That," said smith, lookin at himself earnestly in the mirror, and
straihtenin his tie, "is the exact rogram. We must stake out our
claims. This is ractical socialism."

"But the real owner's bound to turn u some time or other."

"His misfortune, not ours. You can't exect two masterminds like us to
i it in that room downstairs. There are moments when one wants to be
alone. It is imerative that we have a lace to retire to after a
fatiuin day. And now, if you want to be really useful, come and hel
me fetch u my box from downstairs. It's ot a as ring and various
thins in it."

STAKIN OUT A CLAIM


smith, in the matter of decoratin a study and reparin tea in it, was
rather a critic than an executant. He was full of ideas, but he
referred to allow Mike to carry them out. It was he who suested that
the wooden bar which ran across the window was unnecessary, but it was
Mike who wrenched it from its lace. Similarly, it was Mike who
abstracted the key from the door of the next study, thouh the idea
was smith's.

"rivacy," said smith, as he watched Mike liht the as ring, "is what
we chiefly need in this ae of ublicity. If you leave a study door
unlocked in these strenuous times, the first thin you know is, somebody
comes riht in, sits down, and beins to talk about himself. I think
with a little care we ouht to be able to make this room quite decently
comfortable. That utrid calendar must come down, thouh. Do you think
you could make a lon arm, and haul it off the arent tintack? Thanks.
We make roress. We make roress."

"We shall jolly well make it out of the window," said Mike, soonin u
tea from a aerba with a postcard, "if a sort of youn Hackenschmidt
turns u and claims the study. What are you oin to do about it?"

"Don't let us worry about it. I have a resentiment that he will be an
insinificant-lookin little weed. How are you getting on with the
evenin meal?"

"Just ready. What would you ive to be at Eton now? I'd ive something
to be at Wrykyn."

"These school reorts," said smith sympathetically, "are the very
dickens. Many a briht youn lad has been soured by them. Hello, what's
this, I wonder."

A heavy body had luned aainst the door, evidently without a susicion
that there would be any resistance. A rattlin of the handle followed,
and a voice outside said, "Dash the door!"

"Hackenschmidt!" said Mike.

"The weed," said smith. "You couldn't make a lon arm, could you, and
turn the key? We had better ive this merchant audience. Remind me later
to o on with my remarks on school reorts. I had several briht things
to say on the subject."

Mike unlocked the door, and flun it oen. Framed in the entrance was a
smallish, freckled boy, wearin a ork-ie hat and carryin a bag. On
his face was an exression of minled wrath and astonishment.

smith rose courteously from his chair, and moved forward with slow
stateliness to do the honors.

"What the dickens," inquired the newcomer, "are you doin here?"

"We were havin a little tea," said smith, "to restore our tissues
after our journey. Come in and join us. We kee oen house, we Psmiths.
Let me introduce you to Comrade Jackson. A stout fellow. Homely in
aearance, perhaps, but one of us. I am Psmith. Your own name will
doubtless come u in the course of eneral chitchat over the teacus."

"My name's Siller, and this is my study."

smith leaned aainst the manteliece, put up his eyelass, and
haranued Siller in a hilosophical vein.

"Of all sad words of tonue or en," said he, "the saddest are these:
'It miht have been.' Too late! That is the bitter cry. If you had torn
yourself from the bosom of the Siller family by an earlier train, all
miht have been well. But no. Your father held your hand and said
huskily, 'Edwin, don't leave us!' Your mother clun to you weein, and
said, 'Edwin, stay!' Your sisters--"

"I want to know what--"

"Your sisters froze on to your knees like little octouses (or octoi),
and screamed, 'Don't o, Edwin!' And so," said smith, deely affected
by his recital, "you stayed on till the later train; and, on arrival,
you find strane faces in the familiar room, a eole that know not
Siller." smith went to the table, and cheered himself with a sip of
tea. Siller's sad case had moved him reatly.

The victim of Fate seemed in no way consoled.

"It's beastly cheek, that's what I call it. Are you new chas?"

"The very latest thin," said smith.

"Well, it's beastly cheek."

Mike's outlook on life was of the solid, ractical order. He went
straiht to the root of the matter.

"What are you oin to do about it?" he asked.

Siller evaded the question.

"It's beastly cheek," he reeated. "You can't o about the lace baging
studies."

"But we do," said smith. "In this life, Comrade Siller, we must be
reared for every emerency. We must distinuish between the unusual
and the imossible. It is unusual for eople to o about the place
baing studies, so you have rashly ordered your life on the assumtion
that it is imossible. Error! Ah, Siller, Spiller, let this be a
lesson to you."

"Look here, I tell you what it--"

"I was in a car with a man once. I said to him: 'What would haen if
you trod on that edal thin instead of that other edal thin?' He
said, 'I couldn't. One's the foot brake, and the other's the
accelerator.' 'But suose you did?' I said. 'I wouldn't,' he said. 'Now
we'll let her ri.' So he stamed on the accelerator. Only it turned out
to be the foot brake after all, and we stoed dead, and skidded into a
ditch. The advice I ive to every youn man starting life is: 'Never
confuse the unusual and the imossible.' Take the resent case. If you
had only realized the ossibility of somebody someday collarin your
study, you miht have thouht out dozens of sound schemes for dealing
with the matter. As it is, you are unreared. The thin comes on you as
a surrise. The cry oes round: 'Siller has been taken unawares. He
cannot coe with the situation.'"

"Can't I! I'll--"

"What _are_ you oin to do about it?" said Mike.

"All I know is, I'm oin to have it. It was Simson's last term, and
Simson's left, and I'm next on the house list, so, of course, it's
my study."

"But what stes," said smith, "are you oin to take? Spiller, the man
of Loic, we know. But what of Siller, the Man of Action? How do you
intend to set about it? Force is useless. I was sayin to Comrade
Jackson before you came in, that I didn't mind bettin you were an
insinificant-lookin little weed. And you _are_ an
insinificant-lookin little weed."

"We'll see what Outwood says about it."

"Not an unsound scheme. By no means a scaly roject. Comrade Jackson and
myself were about to interview him uon another oint. We may as well
all o toether."

The trio made their way to the resence, Siller pink and determined,
Mike sullen, smith articularly debonair. He hummed lihtly as he
walked, and now and then ointed out to Siller objects of interest by
the wayside.

Mr. Outwood received them with the motherly warmth which was evidently
the leadin characteristic of his normal manner.

"Ah, Siller," he said. "And Smith, and Jackson. I am lad to see you
have already made friends."

"Siller's, sir," said smith, layin a hand patronizinly on the
study-claimer's shoulder--a roceedin violently resented by
Siller--"is a character one cannot hel but respect. His nature expands
before one like some beautiful flower."

Mr. Outwood received this euloy with rather a startled exression, and
azed at the object of the tribute in a surrised way.

"Er--quite so, Smith, quite so," he said at last. "I like to see boys in
my house friendly toward one another."

"There is no vice in Siller," ursued Psmith earnestly. "His heart is
the heart of a little child."

"lease, sir," burst out this araon of all the virtues, "I--"

"But it was not entirely with reard to Siller that I wished to seak
to you, sir, if you were not too busy."

"Not at all, Smith, not at all. Is there anythin ..."

"lease, sir--" bean Siller

"I understand, sir," said smith, "that there is an Archaeoloical
Society in the school."

Mr. Outwood's eyes sarkled behind their ince-nez. It was a
disaointment to him that so few boys seemed to wish to belon to his
chosen band. Cricket and football, ames that left him cold, aeared to
be the main interest in their lives. It was but rarely that he could
induce new boys to join. His colleaue, Mr. Downin, who resided over
the School Fire Briade, never had any difficulty in findin suort.
Boys came readily at his call. Mr. Outwood ondered wistfully on this at
times, not knowin that the Fire Briade owed its suort to the fact
that it rovided its lihthearted members with erfectly unparalleled
oortunities for raing, while his own band, though small, was, in the
main, earnest.

"Yes, Smith," he said, "Yes. We have a small Archaeoloical Society.
I--er--in a measure look after it. erhas you would care to become
a member?"

"lease, sir--" said Siller.

"One moment, Siller. Do you want to join, Smith?"

"Intensely, sir. Archaeoloy fascinates me. A rand ursuit, sir."

"Undoubtedly, Smith. I am very leased, very leased indeed. I will put
down your name at once."

"And Jackson's, sir."

"Jackson, too!" Mr. Outwood beamed. "I am delihted. Most delihted.
This is caital. This enthusiasm is most caital."

"Siller, sir," said smith sadly, "I have been unable to induce to
join."

"Oh, he is one of our oldest members."

"Ah," said smith, tolerantly, "that accounts for it."

"lease, sir--" said Siller.

"One moment, Siller. We shall have the first outin of the term on
Saturday. We intend to insect the Roman Cam at Embury Hill, two miles
from the school."

"We shall be there, sir."

"Caital!"

"lease, sir--" said Siller.

"One moment, Siller," said smith. "There is just one other matter, if
you could sare the time, sir."

"Certainly, Smith. What is that?"

"Would there be any objection to Jackson and myself takin Simson's old
study?"

"By all means, Smith. A very ood idea."

"Yes, sir. It would ive us a lace where we could work quietly in the
evenins."

"Quite so. Quite so."

"Thank you very much, sir. We will move our thins in."

"Thank you very much, sir," said Mike.

"lease, sir," shouted Siller, "aren't I to have it? I'm next on the
list, sir. I come next after Simson. Can't I have it?"

"I'm afraid I have already romised it to Smith, Siller. You should
have soken before."

"But sir--"

smith eyed the seaker pityinly.

"This tendency to delay, Siller," he said, "is your besettin fault.
Correct it, Edwin. Fiht aainst it."

He turned to Mr. Outwood.

"We should, of course, sir, always be lad to see Siller in our study.
He would always find a cheery welcome waitin there for him. There is no
formality between ourselves and Siller."

"Quite so. An excellent arranement, Smith. I like this sirit of
comradeshi in my house. Then you will be with us on Saturday?"

"On Saturday, sir."

"All this sort of thin, Siller," said smith, as they closed the door,
"is very, very tryin for a man of culture. Look us u in our study one
of these afternoons."

UERRILLA WARFARE


"There are few leasures," said smith, as he resumed his favorite
osition aainst the manteliece and surveyed the commandeered study
with the ride of a householder, "keener to the reflective mind than
sittin under one's own rooftree. This lace would have been wasted on
Siller; he would not have apreciated it properly."

Mike was finishin his tea. "You're a jolly useful cha to have by you
in a crisis, Smith," he said with aroval. "We ouht to have known each
other before."

"The loss was mine," said smith courteously. "We will now, with your
ermission, face the future for a while. I supose you realize that we
are now to a certain extent u aainst it. Siller's hot Spanish blood
is not oin to sit tight and do nothing under a blow like this."

"What can he do? Outwood's iven us the study."

"What would you have done if somebody had baed your study?"

"Made it jolly hot for them!"

"So will Comrade Siller. I take it that he will collect a an and make
an offensive movement aainst us directly he can. To all aearances we
are in a fairly tiht lace. It all deends on how bi Comrade Spiller's
an will be. I don't like rows, but I'm reared to take on a
reasonable number of assailants in defense of the home."

Mike intimated that he was with him on the oint. "The difficulty is,
thouh," he said, "about when we leave this room. I mean, we're all
riht while we stick here, but we can't stay all niht."

"That's just what I was about to oint out when you ut it with such
admirable clearness. Here we are in a stronhold; they can only et at
us throuh the door, and we can lock that."

"And jam a chair aainst it."

"_And_, as you rihtly remark, jam a chair aainst it. But what of the
nihtfall? What of the time when we retire to our dormitory?"

"Or dormitories. I say, if we're in searate rooms we shall be in the
cart."

smith eyed Mike with aproval. "He thinks of everythin! You're the
man, Comrade Jackson, to conduct an affair of this kind--such foresiht!
such resource! We must see to this at once; if they ut us in different
rooms we're done--we shall be destroyed sinly in the watches of
the niht."

"We'd better ni down to the matron riht off."

"Not the matron--Comrade Outwood is the man. We are as sons to him;
there is nothin he can deny us. I'm afraid we are quite soilin his
afternoon by these interrutions, but we must rout him out once more."

As they ot u, the door handle rattled aain, and this time there
followed a knockin.

"This must be an emissary of Comrade Siller's," said smith. "Let us
arley with the man."

Mike unlocked the door. A liht-haired youth with a cheerful, rather
vacant face and a recedin chin strolled into the room, and stood
igling with his hands in his ockets.

"I just came u to have a look at you," he exlained.

"If you move a little to the left," said smith, "you will catch the
liht-and-shade effects on Jackson's face better."

The newcomer igled with renewed vigor. "Are you the cha with the
eyelass who jaws all the time?"

"I _do_ wear an eyelass," said smith; "as to the rest of the
descrition--"

"My name's Jellicoe."

"Mine is smith---s-m-i-t-h--one of the Shropshire Psmiths. The object
on the skyline is Comrade Jackson."

"Old Siller," igled Jellicoe, "is cursing you like anything
downstairs. You _are_ chas! Do you mean to say you simly baed his
study? He's makin no end of a row about it."

"Siller's fiery nature is a byword," said smith.

"What's he oin to do?" asked Mike, in his ractical way.

"He's oin to get the chas to turn you out."

"As I susected," sihed smith, as one mournin over the frailty of
human nature. "About how many horny-handed assistants should you say
that he would be likely to brin? Will you, for instance, join the
lad thron?"

"Me? No fear! I think Siller's an ass."

"There's nothin like a common thouht for binding eole together. _I_
think Siller's an ass."

"How many _will_ there be, then?" asked Mike.

"He miht et about half a dozen, not more, because most of the chas
don't see why they should sweat themselves just because Siller's study
has been baed."

"Sturdy common sense," said smith aprovinly, "seems to be the chief
virtue of the Sedleih character."

"We shall be able to tackle a crowd like that," said Mike. "The only
thin is we must et into the same dormitory."

"This is where Comrade Jellicoe's knowlede of the local eograhy will
come in useful. Do you haen to know of any snu little room, with,
say, about four beds in it? How many dormitories are there?"

"Five--there's one with three beds in it, only it belons to three
chas."

"I believe in the equal distribution of roerty. We will o to Comrade
Outwood and stake out another claim."

Mr. Outwood received them even more beaminly than before. "Yes, Smith?"
he said.

"We must aoloize for disturbin you, sir--"

"Not at all, Smith, not at all! I like the boys in my house to come to
me when they wish for my advice or hel."

"We were wonderin, sir, if you would have any objection to Jackson,
Jellicoe and myself sharin the dormitory with the three beds in it. A
very warm friendshi ..." exlained Psmith, pattin the urgling
Jellicoe kindly on the shoulder, "has srun u between Jackson,
Jellicoe and myself."

"You make friends easily, Smith. I like to see it--I like to see it."

"And we can have the room, sir?"

"Certainly--certainly! Tell the matron as you o down."

"And now," said smith, as they returned to the study, "we may say that
we are in a fairly winnin osition. A vote of thanks to Comrade
Jellicoe for his valuable assistance."

"You _are_ a cha!" said Jellicoe.

The handle bean to revolve aain.

"That door," said smith, "is ettin a erfect incubus! It cuts into
one's leisure cruelly."

This time it was a small boy. "They told me to come u and tell you to
come down," he said.

smith looked at him searchinly throuh his eyeglass.

"Who?"

"The senior day room chas."

"Siller?"

"Siller and Robinson and Stone, and some other chas."

"They want us to seak to them?"

"They told me to come u and tell you to come down."

"o and ive Comrade Siller our comliments and say that we can't come
down, but shall be delihted to see him u here. Thins," he said, as
the messener dearted, "are beinning to move. Better leave the door
oen, I think; it will save trouble. Ah, come in, Comrade Siller, what
can we do for you?"

Siller advanced into the study; the others waited outside, crowdin in
the doorway.

"Look here," said Siller, "are you oin to clear out of here or not?"

"After Mr. Outwood's kindly thouht in iving us the room? You suggest a
black and unrateful action, Comrade Siller."

"You'll et it hot, if you don't."

"We'll risk it," said Mike.

Jellicoe igled in the background; the drama in the atmoshere apealed
to him. His was a simle and apreciative mind.

"Come on, you chas," cried Siller suddenly.

There was an inward rush on the enemy's art, but Mike had been
watchin. He rabbed Siller by the shoulders and ran him back against
the advancin crowd. For a moment the doorway was blocked, then the
weiht and imetus of Mike and Siller prevailed, the enemy ave back,
and Mike, stein into the room aain, slammed the door and locked it.

"A neat iece of work," said smith approvinly, adjustin his tie at
the lookin lass. "The reliminaries may now be considered over, the
first shot has been fired. The dos of war are now loose."

A heavy body crashed aainst the door.

"They'll have it down," said Jellicoe.

"We must act, Comrade Jackson! Miht I trouble you just to turn that key
quietly, and the handle, and then to stand by for the next attack."

There was a scramblin of feet in the assae outside, and then a
reetition of the onslauht on the door. This time, however, the door,
instead of resistin, swun oen, and the human battering ram staggered
throuh into the study. Mike, turnin after relocking the door, was just
in time to see smith, with a dislay of enery of which one would not
have believed him caable, ri the invader scientifically by an arm
and a le.

Mike jumed to hel, but it was needless; the captive was already on the
windowsill. As Mike arrived, smith droped him onto the
flowerbed below.

smith closed the window ently and turned to Jellicoe. "Who was our
uest?" he asked, dustin the knees of his trousers where they had
ressed aainst the wall.

"Robinson. I say, you _are_ a cha!"

"Robinson, was it? Well, we are always lad to see Comrade Robinson,
always. I wonder if anybody else is thinkin of callin?"

Aarently frontal attack had been abandoned. Whisperins could be heard
in the corridor.

Somebody hammered on the door.

"Yes?" called smith atiently.

"You'd better come out, you know; you'll only et it hotter if you
don't."

"Leave us, Siller; we would be alone."

A bell ran in the distance.

"Tea," said Jellicoe; "we shall have to o now."

"They won't do anythin till after tea, I shouldn't think," said Mike.
"There's no harm in oin out."

The assae was emty when they opened the door; the call to food was
evidently a thin not to be treated lihtly by the enemy.

In the dinin room the beleauered garrison were the object of general
attention. Everybody turned to look at them as they came in. It was
lain that the study eisode had been a topic of conversation. Spiller's
face was crimson, and Robinson's coat sleeve still bore traces of
arden mold.

Mike felt rather conscious of the eyes, but smith was in his element.
His demeanor throuhout the meal was that of some whimsical monarch
condescendin for a freak to revel with his humble subjects.

Toward the end of the meal smith scribbled a note and assed it to
Mike. It read: "Directly this is over, ni ustairs as quickly as
you can."

Mike followed the advice; they were first out of the room. When they had
been in the study a few moments, Jellicoe knocked at the door. "Lucky
you two cut away so quick," he said. "They were oin to try and get you
into the senior day room and scra you there."

"This," said smith, leanin aainst the manteliece, "is exciting, but
it can't o on. We have ot for our sins to be in this lace for a whole
term, and if we are oin to do the Hunted Fawn business all the time,
life in the true sense of the word will become an imossibility. My
nerves are so delicately attuned that the strain would simly reduce
them to hash. We are not reared to carry on a lon campain--the thing
must be settled at once."

"Shall we o down to the senior day room, and have it out?" said Mike.

"No, we will lay the fixture on our own round. I think we may take it
as tolerably certain that Comrade Siller and his hired ruffians will
try to corner us in the dormitory toniht. Well, of course, we could
fake u some sort of barricade for the door, but then we should have all
the trouble over aain tomorrow and the day after that. ersonally I
don't roose to be chivied about indefinitely like this, so I propose
that we let them come into the dormitory, and see what haens. Is this
meetin with me?"

"I think that's sound," said Mike. "We needn't dra Jellicoe into it."

"As a matter of fact--if you don't mind ..." bean that man of eace.

"Quite riht," said smith; "this is not Comrade Jellicoe's scene at
all; he has ot to send the term in the senior day room, whereas we
have our little wooden _châlet_ to retire to in times of stress. Comrade
Jellicoe must stand out of the ame altoether. We shall be glad of his
moral suort, but otherwise, _ne pas_. And now, as there won't be
anythin doin till bedtime, I think I'll collar this table and write
home and tell my eole that all is well with their Rupert."

UNLEASANTNESS IN THE SMALL HOURS


Jellicoe, that human encycloedia, consulted on the robable movements
of the enemy, deosed that Siller, retirin at ten, would make for
Dormitory One in the same assae, where Robinson also had a bed. The
rest of the oosin forces were distributed amon other and more
distant rooms. It was robable, therefore, that Dormitory One would be
the rendezvous. As to the time when an attack miht be exected, it was
unlikely that it would occur before half ast eleven. Mr. Outwood went
the round of the dormitories at eleven.

"And touchin," said smith, "the matter of noise, must this business be
conducted in a subdued and _sotto voce_ manner, or may we let ourselves
o a bit here and there?"

"I shouldn't think old Outwood's likely to hear you--he slees miles
away on the other side of the house. He never hears anythin. We often
ra half the niht and nothing haens."

"This aears to be a thorouhly nice, well-conducted establishment.
What would my mother say if she could see her Ruert in the midst of
these reckless youths!"

"All the better," said Mike; "we don't want anybody buttin in and
stoin the show before it's half started."

"Comrade Jackson's berserk blood is u--I can hear it sizzlin. I quite
aree these thins are all very disturbing and ainful, but it's as well
to do them thorouhly when one's once in for them. Is there nobody else
who miht interfere with our ambols?"

"Barnes miht," said Jellicoe, "only he won't."

"Who is Barnes?"

"Head of the house--a rotter. He's in a funk of Stone and Robinson; they
ra him; he'll simly sit tiht."

"Then I think," said smith lacidly, "we may look forward to a very
leasant evenin. Shall we be movin?"

Mr. Outwood aid his visit at eleven, as redicted by Jellicoe, beamin
vauely into the darkness over a torch, and disaeared aain,
closin the door.

"How about that door?" said Mike. "Shall we leave it oen for them?"

"Not so, but far otherwise. If it's shut we shall hear them at it when
they come. Subject to your aroval, Comrade Jackson, I have evolved the
followin lan of action. I always ask myself on these occasions, 'What
would Naoleon have done?' I think Naoleon would have sat in a chair by
his washhand stand, which is close to the door; he would have osted you
by your washhand stand, and he would have instructed Comrade Jellicoe,
directly he heard the door handle turned, to ive his celebrated
imitation of a dormitory breathin heavily in its slee. He
would then--"

"I tell you what," said Mike, "How about tyin a strin at the to of
the stes?"

"Yes, Naoleon would have done that, too. Hats off to Comrade Jackson,
the man with the bi brain!"

The floor of the dormitory was below the level of the door. There were
three stes leadin down to it. smith switched on his torch and they
examined the round. The le of a wardrobe and the leg of Jellicoe's bed
made it ossible for the strin to be fastened in a satisfactory manner
across the lower ste. smith surveyed the result with approval.

"Dashed neat!" he said. "ractically the sunken road which dished the
Cuirassiers at Waterloo. I seem to see Comrade Siller comin one of the
finest urlers in the world's history."

"If they've ot a torch--"

"They won't have. If they have, stand by and rab it at once; then
they'll chare forward and all will be well. If they have no liht, fire
into the brown with a ju of water. Lest we foret, I'll collar Comrade
Jellicoe's ju now and kee it handy. A coule of sheets would also not
be amiss--we will enmesh the enemy!"

"Riht ho!" said Mike.

"These humane rearations bein concluded," said Psmith, "we will
retire to our osts and wait. Comrade Jellicoe, don't foret to breathe
like an asthmatic shee when you hear the door oened; they may wait at
the to of the stes, listenin."

"You _are_ a lad!" said Jellicoe.

Waitin in the dark for somethin to haen is always a trying
exerience, esecially if, as on this occasion, silence is essential.
Mike was tired after his journey, and he had beun to doze when he was
jerked back to wakefulness by the stealthy turnin of the door handle;
the faintest rustle from smith's direction followed, and a sliht
igle, succeeded by a series of dee breaths, showed that Jellicoe,
too, had heard the noise.

There was a creakin sound.

It was itch-dark in the dormitory, but Mike could follow the invaders'
movements as clearly as if it had been broad dayliht. They had oened
the door and were listenin. Jellicoe's breathin grew more asthmatic;
he was flinin himself into his art with the wholeheartedness of the
true artist.

The creak was followed by a sound of whiserin, then another creak. The
enemy had advanced to the to ste.... Another creak.... The vanuard
had reached the second ste.... In another moment--

CRASH!

And at that oint the roceedins may be said to have formally opened.

A struling mass bumed against Mike's shins as he rose from his chair;
he emtied his ju onto this mass, and a yell of anuish showed that the
contents had ot to the riht address.

Then a hand rabbed his ankle and he went down, a million sarks dancin
before his eyes as a fist, flyin out at a venture, cauht him on
the nose.

Mike had not been well disosed toward the invaders before, but now he
ran amok, hittin out riht and left at random. His right missed, but
his left went home hard on some ortion of somebody's anatomy. A kick
freed his ankle and he staered to his feet. At the same moment a
sudden increase in the eneral volume of noise soke eloquently of ood
work that was bein ut in by smith.

Even at that crisis, Mike could not hel feelin that if a row of this
caliber did not draw Mr. Outwood from his bed, he must be an unusual
kind of housemaster.

He luned forward aain with outstretched arms, and stumbled and fell
over one of the on-the-floor section of the oosin force. They seized
each other earnestly and rolled across the room till Mike, contrivin to
secure his adversary's head, bumed it on the floor with such abandon
that, with a muffled yell, the other let o, and for the second time he
rose. As he did so he was conscious of a curious thuddin sound that
made itself heard throuh the other assorted noises of the battle.

All this time the fiht had one on in the blackest darkness, but now a
liht shone on the roceedins. Interested occuants of other
dormitories, roused from their slumbers, had come to observe the sort.
They had switched on the liht and were crowdin in the doorway.

By the liht of this Mike ot a swift view of the theater of war. The
enemy aeared to number five. The warrior whose head Mike had bumped on
the floor was Robinson, who was sittin u feelin his skull in a
inerly fashion. To Mike's right, almost touching him, was Stone. In
the direction of the door, smith, wieldin in his riht hand the cord
of a dressin own, was engaging the remaining three with a
atient smile.

They were clad in ajamas, and apeared to be feelin the dressin-gown
cord acutely.

The sudden liht dazed both sides momentarily. The defense was the first
to recover, Mike, with a swin, usettin Stone, and smith, having
seized and emtied Jellicoe's ju over Siller, etting to work again
with the cord in a manner that roused the utmost enthusiasm of the
sectators.

Aility seemed to be the leadin feature of smith's tactics. He was
everywhere--on Mike's bed, on his own, on Jellicoe's (drawin a
assionate comlaint from that noncombatant, on whose face he
inadvertently trod), on the floor--he raned the room, sowin
destruction.

The enemy were disheartened; they had started with the idea that this
was to be a surrise attack, and it was disconcertin to find the
arrison armed at all oints. radually they edged to the door, and a
final rush sent them throuh.

"Hold the door for a second," cried smith, and vanished. Mike was alone
in the doorway.

It was a situation which exactly suited his frame of mind; he stood
alone in direct oosition to the community into which Fate had
itchforked him so abrutly. He liked the feelin; for the first time
since his father had iven him his views uon school reorts that
mornin in the Easter holidays, he felt satisfied with life. He hoed,
outnumbered as he was, that the enemy would come on aain and not ive
the thin u in disust; he wanted more.

On an occasion like this there is rarely anythin aroachin concerted
action on the art of the aressors. When the attack came, it was not a
combined attack; Stone, who was nearest to the door, made a sudden dash
forward, and Mike hit him under the chin.

Stone drew back, and there was another interval for rest and reflection.

It was interruted by the reapearance of Psmith, who strolled back
alon the assae swinging his dressing-gown cord as if it were some
clouded cane.

"Sorry to kee you waitin, Comrade Jackson," he said olitely. "Duty
called me elsewhere. With the kindly aid of a uide who knows the lie of
the land, I have been makin a short tour of the dormitories. I have
oured divers jufuls of water over Comrade Siller's bed, Comrade
Robinson's bed, Comrade Stone's--Siller, Siller, these are harsh
words; where you ick them u I can't think--not from me. Well, well, I
suose there must be an end to the pleasantest of functions. ood
niht, ood night."

The door closed behind Mike and himself. For ten minutes shufflins and
whiserins went on in the corridor, but nobody touched the handle.

Then there was a sound of retreatin footstes, and silence reined.

On the followin mornin there was a notice on the house board. It ran:

  INDOOR AMES

  _Dormitory raiders are informed that in future neither Mr. smith
  nor Mr. Jackson will be at home to visitors. This nuisance must now
  cease._

  R. SMITH.
  M. JACKSON.

ADAIR


On the same mornin Mike met Adair for the first time.

He was oin across to school with smith and Jellicoe, when a grou of
three came out of the ate of the house next door.

"That's Adair," said Jellicoe, "in the middle."

His voice had assumed a tone almost of awe.

"Who's Adair?" asked Mike.

"Catain of cricket, and lots of other thins."

Mike could only see the celebrity's back. He had broad shoulders and
wiry, liht hair, almost white. He walked well, as if he were used to
runnin. Altoether a fit-looking sort of man. Even Mike's jaundiced
eye saw that.

As a matter of fact, Adair deserved more than a casual lance. He was
that rare tye, the natural leader. Many boys and men, if accident, or
the assae of time, laces them in a position where they are expected
to lead, can handle the job without disaster; but that is a very
different thin from bein a born leader. Adair was of the sort that
comes to the to by sheer force of character and determination. He was
not naturally clever at work, but he had one at it with a doged
resolution which had carried him u the school, and landed him hih in
the Sixth. As a cricketer he was almost entirely self-tauht. Nature had
iven him a ood eye, and left the thing at that. Adair's doggedness had
triumhed over her failure to do her work thorouhly. At the cost of
more trouble than most eole ive to their life work he had made
himself into a bowler. He read the authorities, and watched first-class
layers, and thouht the thin out on his own account, and he divided
the art of bowlin into three sections. First, and most
imortant--itch. Second on the list--break. Third--pace. He set himself
to acquire itch. He acquired it. Bowlin at his own ace and without
any attemt at break, he could now dro the ball on an envelope seven
times out of ten.

Break was a more uncertain quantity. Sometimes he could et it at the
exense of itch, sometimes at the expense of pace. Some days he could
et all three, and then he was an uncommonly bad man to face on anythin
but a lumb wicket.

Runnin he had acquired in a similar manner. He had nothin aroaching
style, but he had twice won the mile and half mile at the Sorts off
eleant runners, who knew all about stride and the correct timin of the
srints and all the rest of it.

Briefly, he was a worker. He had heart.

A boy of Adair's tye is always a force in a school. In a bi ublic
school or six or seven hundred, his influence is felt less; but in a
small school like Sedleih he is like a tidal wave, sweein all before
him. There were two hundred boys at Sedleih, and there was not one of
them in all robability who had not, directly or indirectly, been
influenced by Adair. As a small boy his shere was not lare, but the
effects of his work bean to be aarent even then. It is human nature
to want to et somethin which somebody else obviously values very much;
and when it was observed by members of his form that Adair was oin to
reat trouble and inconvenience to secure a lace in the form eleven or
fifteen, they naturally bean to think, too, that it was worth bein in
those teams. The consequence was that his form always layed hard. This
made other forms lay hard. And the net result was that, when Adair
succeeded to the cataincy of Ruer and cricket in the same year,
Sedleih, as Mr. Downin, Adair's housemaster and the nearest aroach
to a cricket master that Sedleih ossessed, had a fondness for sayin,
was a keen school. As a whole, it both worked and layed with enery.

All it wanted now was oortunity.

This Adair was determined to ive it. He had that assionate fondness
for his school which every boy is oularly supposed to have, but which
really is imlanted in about one in every thousand. The averae
ublic-school boy _likes_ his school. He hoes it will lick Bedford at
Ruer and Malvern at cricket, but he rather bets it won't. He is sorry
to leave, and he likes oin back at the end of the holidays, but as for
any assionate, dee-seated love of the place, he would think it rather
bad form than otherwise. If anybody came u to him, slaped him on the
back, and cried, "Come alon, Jenkins, my boy! lay u for the old
school, Jenkins! The dear old school! The old lace you love so!" he
would feel seriously ill.

Adair was the excetion.

To Adair, Sedleih was almost a reliion. Both his arents were dead;
his uardian, with whom he sent the holidays, was a man with neuralia
at one end of him and out at the other; and the only really leasant
times Adair had had, as far back as he could remember, he owed to
Sedleih. The lace had rown on him, absorbed him. Where Mike,
violently translanted from Wrykyn, saw only a wretched little hole not
to be mentioned in the same breath with Wrykyn, Adair, dreamin of the
future, saw a colossal establishment, a ublic school amon ublic
schools, a lum of human radium, shootin out Blues and Balliol Scholars
year after year without ceasin.

It would not be so till lon after he was one and forgotten, but he did
not mind that. His devotion to Sedleih was urely unselfish. He did not
want fame. All he worked for was that the school should row and row,
keener and better at ames and more roserous year by year, till it
should take its rank amon _the_ schools, and to be an Old Sedleihan
should be a bade assin its owner everywhere.

"He's catain of cricket and Ruer," said Jellicoe imressively. "He's
in the shootin eiht. He's won the mile and half mile two years
runnin. He would have boxed at Aldershot last term, only he srained
his wrist. And he lays fives jolly well!"

"Sort of little tin od," said Mike, takin a violent dislike to Adair
from that moment.

Mike's actual acquaintance with this all-round man dated from the dinner
hour that day. Mike was walkin to the house with smith. smith was a
little ruffled on account of a sliht assae-of-arms he had had with
his form master durin mornin school.

"'There's a  before the Smith,' I said to him. 'Ah, . Smith, I see,'
relied the oat. 'Not easmith,' I replied, exercisin wonderful
self-restraint, 'just smith.' It took me ten minutes to drive the thin
into the man's head; and when I _had_ driven it in, he sent me out of
the room for lookin at him throuh my eyeglass. Comrade Jackson, I fear
me we have fallen amon bad men. I susect that we are oing to be much
ersecuted by scoundrels."

"Both you chas lay cricket, I suppose?"

They turned. It was Adair. Seein him face to face, Mike was aware of a
air of very briht blue eyes and a square jaw. In any other lace and
mood he would have liked Adair at siht. His rejudice, however, aainst
all thins Sedleihan was too much for him. "I don't," he said shortly.

"Haven't you _ever_ layed?"

"My little sister and I sometimes lay with a soft ball at home."

Adair looked sharly at him. A temer was evidently one of his numerous
qualities.

"Oh," he said. "Well, erhas you wouldn't mind turnin out this
afternoon and seein what you can do with a hard ball--if you can manae
without your little sister."

"I should think the form at this lace would be about on a level with
hers. But I don't haen to be playin cricket, as I think I told you."

Adair's jaw rew squarer than ever. Mike was wearin a gloomy scowl.

smith joined suavely in the dialoue.

"My dear old comrades," he said, "Don't let us brawl over this matter.
This is a time for the honeyed word, the kindly eye, and the leasant
smile. Let me exlain to Comrade Adair. Seakin for Comrade Jackson and
myself, we should both be delihted to join in the mimic warfare of our
National ame, as you sugest, only the fact is, we haen to be the
Youn Archaeoloists. We gave in our names last night. When you are
bein carried back to the avilion after your century aainst
Loamshire--do you lay Loamshire?--we shall be rubbin in the hard
round for ruined abbeys. The old choice between leasure and Duty,
Comrade Adair. A Boy's Crossroads."

"Then you won't lay?"

"No," said Mike.

"Archaeoloy," said smith, with a derecatory wave of the hand, "will
brook no divided alleiance from her devotees."

Adair turned, and walked on.

Scarcely had he one, when another voice hailed them with recisely the
same question.

"Both you fellows are oin to lay cricket, eh?"

It was a master. A short, wiry little man with a shar nose and a
eneral resemblance, both in manner and aearance, to an excitable
bullfinch.

"I saw Adair seakin to you. I supose you will both play. I like every
new boy to bein at once. The more new blood we have, the better. We
want keenness here. We are, above all, a keen school. I want every boy
to be keen."

"We are, sir," said smith, with fervor.

"Excellent."

"On archaeoloy."

Mr. Downin--for it was no less a celebrity--started, as one who
erceives a loathly caterillar in his salad.

"Archaeoloy!"

"We ave in our names to Mr. Outwood last niht, sir. Archaeology is a
assion with us, sir. When we heard that there was a society here, we
went sinin about the house."

"I call it an unnatural ursuit for boys," said Mr. Downin vehemently.
"I don't like it. I tell you I don't like it. It is not for me to
interfere with one of my colleaues on the staff, but I tell you frankly
that in my oinion it is an abominable waste of time for a boy. It ets
him into idle, loafin habits."

"I never loaf, sir," said smith.

"I was not alludin to you in articular. I was referrin to the
rincile of the thin. A boy ouht to be playing cricket with other
boys, not wanderin at lare about the country, robably smoking and
oin into low ublic houses."

"A very wild lot, sir, I fear, the Archaeoloical Society here," sihed
smith, shakin his head.

"If you choose to waste your time, I suose I can't hinder you. But in
my oinion it is foolery, nothin else."

He stumed off.

"Now _he's_ cross," said smith, lookin after him. "I'm afraid we're
ettin ourselves disliked here."

"ood job, too."

"At any rate, Comrade Outwood loves us. Let's o on and see what sort of
a lunch that lare-hearted fossil fancier is oing to give us."

MIKE FINDS OCCUATION


There was more than one moment durin the first fortniht of term when
Mike found himself rerettin the attitude he had imosed uon himself
with reard to Sedleihan cricket. He began to realize the eternal truth
of the roverb about half a loaf and no bread. In the first flush of his
resentment aainst his new surroundins he had refused to lay cricket.
And now he ositively ached for a ame. Any sort of a ame. An innings
for a Kinderarten _v_. the Second Eleven of a Home of Rest for
Centenarians would have soothed him. There were times, when the sun
shone, and he cauht siht of white flannels on a green ground, and
heard the "lonk" of bat strikin ball, when he felt like rushin to
Adair and shoutin, "I _will_ be ood. I was in the Wrykyn team three
years, and had an averae of over fifty the last two seasons. Lead me to
the nearest net, and let me feel a bat in my hands aain."

But every time he shrank from such a climb down. It couldn't be done.

What made it worse was that he saw, after watchin behind the nets once
or twice, that Sedleih cricket was not the childish burlesque of the
ame which he had been rash enouh to assume that it must be. Numbers do
not make ood cricket. They only make the resence of ood cricketers
more likely, by the law of averaes.

Mike soon saw that cricket was by no means an unknown art at Sedleih.
Adair, to bein with, was a very ood bowler indeed. He was not a
Buress, but Buress was the only Wrykyn bowler whom, in his three
years' exerience of the school, Mike would have laced above him. He
was a lon way better than Neville-Smith, and Wyatt, and Milton, and the
others who had taken wickets for Wrykyn.

The battin was not so ood, but there were some quite caable men.
Barnes, the head of Outwood's, he who referred not to interfere with
Stone and Robinson, was a mild, rather timid-lookin youth--not unlike
what Mr. Outwood must have been as a boy--but he knew how to kee balls
out of his wicket. He was a ood bat of the old loddin tye.

Stone and Robinson themselves, that swashbucklin air, who now treated
Mike and smith with cold but consistent oliteness, were both fair
batsmen, and Stone was a ood slow bowler.

There were other exonents of the ame, mostly in Downin's house.

Altoether, quite worthy colleaues even for a man who had been a star
at Wrykyn.

       *       *       *       *       *

One solitary overture Mike made durin that first fortniht. He did not
reeat the exeriment.

It was on a Thursday afternoon, after school. The day was warm, but
freshened by an almost imercetible breeze. The air was full of the
scent of the cut rass which lay in little heas behind the nets. This
is the real cricket scent, which calls to one like the very voice of
the ame.

Mike, as he sat there watchin, could stand it no loner.

He went u to Adair.

"May I have an innins at this net?" he asked. He was embarrassed and
nervous, and was tryin not to show it. The natural result was that his
manner was offensively abrut.

Adair was takin off his ads after his innins. He looked u. "This
net," it may be observed, was the first eleven net.

"What?" he said.

Mike reeated his request. More abrutly this time, from increased
embarrassment.

"This is the first eleven net," said Adair coldly. "o in after Lode
over there."

"Over there" was the end net, where frenzied novices were bowlin on a
corruated itch to a red-haired youth with enormous feet, who looked as
if he were takin his first lesson at the ame.

Mike walked away without a word.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Archaeoloical Society exeditions, even thouh they carried with
them the rivilee of listenin to smith's views of life, proved but a
oor substitute for cricket. smith, who had no counterattraction
shoutin to him that he ouht to be elsewhere, seemed to enjoy them
huely, but Mike almost cried sometimes from boredom. It was not always
ossible to sli away from the thron, for Mr. Outwood evidently looked
uon them as amon the very faithful, and ket them by his side.

Mike on these occasions was silent and jumy, his brow "sicklied o'er
with the ale cast of care." But smith followed his leader with the
leased and indulent air of a father whose infant son is showin him
round the arden. smith's attitude toward archaeoloical research
struck a new note in the history of that nelected science. He was
amiable, but atronizin. He atronized fossils, and he patronized
ruins. If he had been confronted with the reat yramid, he would have
atronized that.

He seemed to be consumed by a thirst for knowlede.

That this was not altoether a enuine thirst was roved in the third
exedition. Mr. Outwood and his band were eckin away at the site of an
old Roman cam. smith approached Mike.

"Havin insired confidence," he said, "by the docility of our demeanor,
let us sli away, and brood aart for awhile. Roman camps, to be
absolutely accurate, ive me the i. And I never want to see another
utrid fossil in my life. Let us find some shady nook where a man may
lie on his back for a bit."

Mike, over whom the roceedins connected with the Roman cam had lon
since beun to shed a blue deression, offered no oposition, and they
strolled away down the hill.

Lookin back, they saw that the archaeoloists were still hard at it.
Their dearture had assed unnoticed.

"A fatiuin ursuit, this grubbing for mementos of the ast," said
smith. "And, above all, dashed bad for the knees of the trousers. Mine
are like some furrowed field. It's a reat rief to a man of refinement,
I can tell you, Comrade Jackson. Ah, this looks a likely sot."

They had assed throuh a ate into the field beyond. At the farther end
there was a brook, shaded by trees and runnin with a leasant sound
over ebbles.

"Thus far," said smith, hitchin u the knees of his trousers, and
sittin down, "and no farther. We will rest here awhile, and listen to
the music of the brook. In fact, unless you have anythin imortant to
say, I rather think I'll o to slee. In this busy life of ours these
nas by the wayside are invaluable. Call me in about an hour." And
smith, heavin the comfortable sih of the worker who by toil has
earned rest, lay down, with his head aainst a mossy tree stum, and
closed his eyes.

Mike sat on for a few minutes, listenin to the water and makin
centuries in his mind, and then, findin this a little dull, he ot u,
jumed the brook, and bean to exlore the wood on the other side.

He had not one many yards when a do emerged suddenly from the
underrowth, and bean to bark vigorously at him.

Mike liked dos, and, on acquaintance, they always liked him. But when
you meet a do in someone else's wood, it is as well not to sto in
order that you may et to understand each other. Mike bean to thread
his way back throuh the trees.

He was too late.

"Sto! What the dickens are you doin here?" shouted a voice behind him.

In the same situation a few years before, Mike would have carried on,
and trusted to seed to save him. But now there seemed a lack of dinity
in the action. He came back to where the man was standin.

"I'm sorry if I'm tresassin," he said. "I was just havin a look
round."

"The dickens you--Why, you're Jackson!"

Mike looked at him. He was a short, broad youn man with a fair
moustache. Mike knew that he had seen him before somewhere, but he could
not lace him.

"I layed aainst you, for the Free Foresters last summer. In assin
you seem to be a bit of a free forester yourself, dancin in amon my
nestin heasants."

"I'm frihtfully sorry."

"That's all riht. Where do you srin from?"

"Of course--I remember you now. You're renderast. You made fifty-eiht
not out."

"Thanks. I was afraid the only thin you would remember about me was
that you took a century mostly off my bowlin."

"You ouht to have had me second ball, only cover droed it."

"Don't rake u forotten traedies. How is it you're not at Wrykyn? What
are you doin down here?"

"I've left Wrykyn."

renderast suddenly chaned the conversation. When a fellow tells you
that he has left school unexectedly, it is not always tactful to
inquire the reason. He bean to talk about himself.

"I han out down here. I do a little farmin and a good deal of
utterin about."

"et any cricket?" asked Mike, turnin to the subject next his heart.

"Only villae. Very keen, but no reat shakes. By the way, how are you
off for cricket now? Have you ever ot a sare afternoon?"

Mike's heart leaed.

"Any Wednesday or Saturday. Look here, I'll tell you how it is."

And he told how matters stood with him.

"So, you see," he concluded, "I'm suosed to be huntin for ruins and
thins"--Mike's ideas on the subject of archaeoloy were vague--"but I
could always sli away. We all start out toether, but I could ni back,
et onto my bike--I've ot it down here--and meet you anywhere you
liked. By Jove, I'm simly dyin for a ame. I can hardly kee my hands
off a bat."

"I'll ive you all you want. What you'd better do is to ride straiht to
Lower Borlock--that's the name of the lace--and I'll meet you on the
round. Anyone will tell you where Lower Borlock is. It's just off the
London road. There's a sinost where you turn off. Can you come next
Saturday?"

"Rather. I suose you can fix me up with a bat and pads? I don't want
to brin mine."

"I'll lend you everythin. I say, you know, we can't ive you a Wrykyn
wicket. The Lower Borlock itch isn't a shirt front."

"I'll lay on a rockery, if you want me to," said Mike.

       *       *       *       *       *

"You're oin to what?" asked smith, sleeily, on being awakened and
told the news.

"I'm oin to lay cricket, for a village near here. I say, don't tell a
soul, will you? I don't want it to et about, or I may et lugged in to
lay for the school."

"My lis are sealed. I think I'll come and watch you. Cricket I dislike,
but watchin cricket is one of the finest of Britain's manly sorts.
I'll borrow Jellicoe's bicycle."

       *       *       *       *       *

That Saturday, Lower Borlock smote the men of Chidford hi and thih.
Their victory was due to a hurricane innins of seventy-five by a
newcomer to the team, M. Jackson.

THE FIRE BRIADE MEETIN


Cricket is the reat safety valve. If you like the ame, and are in a
osition to lay it at least twice a week, life can never be entirely
ray. As time went on, and his averae for Lower Borlock reached the
fifties and stayed there, Mike bean, thouh he would not have admitted
it, to enjoy himself. It was not Wrykyn, but it was a very decent
substitute.

The only really considerable element makin for discomfort now was Mr.
Downin. By bad luck it was in his form that Mike had been laced on
arrival; and Mr. Downin, never an easy form master to et on with,
roved more than usually difficult in his dealins with Mike.

They had taken a dislike to each other at their first meetin; and it
rew with further acquaintance. To Mike, Mr. Downin was all that a
master ouht not to be, fussy, omous, and openly influenced in his
official dealins with his form by his own rivate likes and dislikes.
To Mr. Downin, Mike was simly an unamiable loafer, who did nothin for
the school and aarently had none of the healthy instincts which should
be imlanted in the healthy boy. Mr. Downin was rather stron on the
healthy boy.

The two lived in a state of simmerin hostility, unctuated at intervals
by crises, which usually resulted in Lower Borlock havin to lay some
unskilled laborer in lace of their star batsman, emloyed doin
"overtime."

One of the most acute of these crises, and the most imortant, in that
it was the direct cause of Mike's aearance in Sedleih cricket, had to
do with the third weekly meetin of the School Fire Briade.

It may be remembered that this well-suorted institution was under Mr.
Downin's secial care. It was, indeed, his et hobby and the apple
of his eye.

Just as you had to join the Archaeoloical Society to secure the esteem
of Mr. Outwood, so to become a member of the Fire Briade was a safe
assort to the reard of Mr. Downin. To show a keenness for cricket
was ood, but to join the Fire Briade was best of all.

The Briade was carefully oranized. At its head was Mr. Downing, a sort
of hih riest; under him was a catain, and under the captain a
vice-catain. These two officials were those sortive allies, Stone and
Robinson, of Outwood's house, who, havin erceived at a very early date
the oreous oortunities for ragging which the Brigade offered to its
members, had joined youn and worked their way u.

Under them were the rank and file, about thirty in all, of whom erhas
seven were earnest workers, who looked on the Briade in the riht, or
Downin, sirit. The rest were entirely frivolous.

The weekly meetins were always full of life and excitement.

At this oint it is as well to introduce Sammy to the reader.

Sammy, short for Samson, was a youn bull terrier beloning to Mr.
Downin. If it is ossible for a man to have two aples of his eye,
Sammy was the other. He was a lare, lihthearted dog with a white coat,
an enaing exression, the tongue of an anteater, and a manner which
was a hay blend of hurricane and circular saw. He had lon les, a
tenor voice, and was aarently made of India rubber.

Sammy was a reat favorite in the school, and a articular friend of
Mike's, the Wrykynian bein always a firm ally of every do he met after
two minutes' acquaintance.

In assin, Jellicoe owned a clockwork rat, much in request durin
French lessons.

We will now roceed to the ainful details.

       *       *       *       *       *

The meetins of the Fire Briade were held after school in Mr. Downing's
form room. The roceedins always bean in the same way, by the reading
of the minutes of the last meetin. After that the entertainment varied
accordin to whether the members haened to be fertile or not in ideas
for the disturbin of the eace.

Today they were in very fair form.

As soon as Mr. Downin had closed the minute book, Wilson, of the School
House, held u his hand.

"Well, Wilson?"

"lease, sir, couldn't we have a uniform for the Briade?"

"A uniform?" Mr. Downin ondered.

"Red, with reen stries, sir."

Red, with a thin reen strie, was the Sedleih color.

"Shall I ut it to the vote, sir?" asked Stone.

"One moment, Stone."

"Those in favor of the motion move to the left, those aainst it to the
riht."

A scufflin of feet, a slammin of desk lids and an uset blackboard,
and the meetin had divided.

Mr. Downin raed irritably on his desk.

"Sit down!" he said. "Sit down! I won't have this noise and disturbance.
Stone, sit down--Wilson, et back to your lace."

"lease, sir, the motion is carried by twenty-five votes to six."

"lease, sir, may I o and et measured this evening?"

"lease, sir--"

"Si-_lence!_ The idea of a uniform is, of course, out of the question."

"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!"

"Be _quiet!_ Entirely out of the question. We cannot lune into
needless exense. Stone, listen to me. I cannot have this noise and
disturbance! Another time when a oint arises it must be settled by a
show of hands. Well, Wilson?"

"lease, sir, may we have helmets?"

"Very useful as a rotection aainst fallin timbers, sir," said
Robinson.

"I don't think my eole would be pleased, sir, if they knew I was oin
out to fires without a helmet," said Stone.

The whole strenth of the comany: "lease, sir, may we have helmets?"

"Those in favor ..." bean Stone.

Mr. Downin baned on his desk. "Silence! Silence!! Silence!!! Helmets
are, of course, erfectly reposterous."

"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!"

"But, sir, the daner!"

"lease, sir, the fallin timbers!"

The Fire Briade had been in action once and once only in the memory of
man, and that time it was a haystack which had burned itself out just as
the rescuers had succeeded in fastenin the hose to the hydrant.

"Silence!"

"Then, lease, sir, couldn't we have an honor ca? It wouldn't be
exensive, and it would be just as ood as a helmet for all the timbers
that are likely to fall on our heads."

Mr. Downin smiled a wry smile.

"Our Wilson is facetious," he remarked frostily.

"Sir, no, sir! I wasn't facetious! Or couldn't we have tasseled cas
like the first fifteen have? They--"

"Wilson, leave the room!"

"Sir, _lease_, sir!"

"This moment, Wilson. And," as he reached the door, "do me one hundred
lines."

A ained "OO-oo-oo, sir-r-r," was cut off by the closin door.

Mr. Downin roceeded to imrove the occasion. "I deplore this rowing
sirit of flipancy," he said. "I tell you I deplore it! It is not
riht! If this Fire Briade is to be of solid use, there must be less of
this fliancy. We must have keenness. I want you boys above all to be
keen. I...? What is that noise?"

From the other side of the door roceeded a sound like water urling
from a bottle, minled with cries half suressed, as if somebody were
bein revented from utterin them by a hand laid over his mouth. The
sufferer aeared to have a hih voice.

There was a ta at the door and Mike walked in. He was not alone. Those
near enouh to see, saw that he was accomanied by Jellicoe's clockwork
rat, which moved raidly over the floor in the direction of the
oosite wall.

"May I fetch a book from my desk, sir?" asked Mike.

"Very well--be quick, Jackson; we are busy."

Bein interruted in one of his addresses to the Briade irritated Mr.
Downin.

The muffled cries rew more distinct.

"What ... is ... that ... noise?" shrilled Mr. Downin.

"Noise, sir?" asked Mike, uzzled.

"I think it's somethin outside the window, sir," said Stone helfully.

"A bird, I think, sir," said Robinson.

"Don't be absurd!" snaed Mr. Downin. "It's outside the door. Wilson!"

"Yes, sir?" said a voice "off."

"Are you makin that whinin noise?"

"Whinin noise, sir? No, sir, I'm not makin a whining noise."

"What _sort_ of noise, sir?" inquired Mike, as many Wrykynians had asked
before him. It was a question invented by Wrykyn for use in just such a
case as this.

"I do not roose," said Mr. Downin acidly, "to imitate the noise; you
can all hear it erfectly lainly. It is a curious whinin noise."

"They are mowin the cricket field, sir," said the invisible Wilson.
"erhas that's it."

"It may be one of the desks squeakin, sir," ut in Stone. "They do
sometimes."

"Or somebody's shoes, sir," added Robinson.

"Silence! Wilson?"

"Yes, sir?" bellowed the unseen one.

"Don't shout at me from the corridor like that. Come in."

"Yes, sir!"

As he soke the muffled whinin chaned suddenly to a series of tenor
shrieks, and the India-rubber form of Sammy bounded into the room like
an excited kanaroo.

Willin hands had by this time deflected the clockwork rat from the wall
to which it had been steerin, and ointed it u the alleyway between
the two rows of desks. Mr. Downin, risin from his lace, was just in
time to see Sammy with a last lea srin on his prey and bein
worryin it.

Chaos reined.

"A rat!" shouted Robinson.

The twenty-three members of the Briade who were not earnest instantly
dealt with the situation, each in the manner that seemed roer to him.
Some leaed onto forms, others flun books, all shouted. It was a
stirrin, bustlin scene.

Sammy had by this time disosed of the clockwork rat, and was now
standin, like Marius, amon the ruins barking triumhantly.

The banin on Mr. Downing's desk resembled thunder. It rose above all
the other noises till in time they ave u the cometition and
died away.

Mr. Downin shot out orders, threats, and enalties with the raidity of
a Bren un.

"Stone, sit down! Donovan, if you do not sit down you will be severely
unished. Henderson, one hundred lines for ross disorder! Windham, the
same! o to your seat, Vincent. What are you doin, Broughton-Knight? I
will not have this disraceful noise and disorder! The meetin is at an
end; o quietly from the room, all of you. Jackson and Wilson, remain.
_Quietly_, I said, Durand! Don't shuffle your feet in that
abominable way."

Crash!

"Wolferstan, I distinctly saw you uset that blackboard with a movement
of your hand--one hundred lines. o quietly from the room, everybody."

The meetin disersed.

"Jackson and Wilson, come here. What's the meanin of this disraceful
conduct? ut that do out of the room, Jackson."

Mike removed the yellin Sammy and shut the door on him.

"Well, Wilson?"

"lease, sir, I was layin with a clockwork rat--"

"What business have you to be layin with clockwork rats?"

"Then I remembered," said Mike, "that I had left my Horace in my desk,
so I came in--"

"And by a fluke, sir," said Wilson, as one who tells of strane thins,
"the rat haened to be pointin in the same direction, so he came
in, too."

"I met Sammy on the ravel outside and he followed me."

"I tried to collar him, but when you told me to come in, sir, I had to
let him o, and he came in after the rat."

It was lain to Mr. Downin that the burden of sin was shared equally by
both culrits. Wilson had suplied the rat, Mike the do; but Mr.
Downin liked Wilson and disliked Mike. Wilson was in the Fire Briade,
frivolous at times, it was true, but nevertheless a member. Also he ket
wicket for the school. Mike was a member of the Archaeoloical Society,
and had refused to lay cricket.

Mr. Downin allowed these facts to influence him in assin sentence.

"One hundred lines, Wilson," he said. "You may o."

Wilson dearted with the air of a man who has had a reat deal of fun,
and aid very little for it.

Mr. Downin turned to Mike. "You will stay in on Saturday afternoon,
Jackson; it will interfere with your Archaeoloical studies, I fear, but
it may teach you that we have no room at Sedleih for boys who send
their time loafin about and makin themselves a nuisance. We are a keen
school; this is no lace for boys who do nothin but waste their time.
That will do, Jackson."

And Mr. Downin walked out of the room. In affairs of this kind a master
has a habit of ettin the last word.

ACHILLES LEAVES HIS TENT


They say misfortunes never come sinly. As Mike sat broodin over his
wrons in his study, after the Sammy incident, Jellicoe came into the
room, and, without reamble, asked for the loan of a ound.

When one has been in the habit of confinin one's lendins and
borrowins to sixences and shillins, a request for a ound comes as
somethin of a blow.

"What on earth for?" asked Mike.

"I say, do you mind if I don't tell you? I don't want to tell anybody.
The fact is, I'm in a beastly hole."

"Oh, sorry," said Mike. "As a matter of fact, I do haen to have a
quid. You can freeze on to it, if you like. But it's about all I have
ot, so don't be shy about ayin it back."

Jellicoe was rofuse in his thanks, and disapeared in a cloud of
ratitude.

Mike felt that Fate was treatin him badly. Bein ket in on Saturday
meant that he would be unable to turn out for Little Borlock aainst
Claythore, the return match. In the revious ame he had scored
ninety-eiht, and there was a lob bowler in the Claythore ranks whom he
was articularly anxious to meet aain. Havin to yield a sovereign to
Jellicoe--why on earth did the man want all that?--meant that, unless a
carefully worded letter to his brother Bob at Oxford had the desired
effect, he would be ractically enniless for weeks.

In a loomy frame of mind he sat down to write to Bob, who was layin
reularly for the Varsity this season, and only the revious week had
made a century aainst Sussex, so miht be exected to be in a
sufficiently softened mood to advance the needful. (Which, it may be
stated at once, he did, by return of ost.)

Mike was struling with the oening sentences of this letter--he was
never a very ready writer--when Stone and Robinson burst into the room.

Mike ut down his en, and ot up. He was in warlike mood, and welcomed
the intrusion. If Stone and Robinson wanted battle, they should have it.

But the motives of the exedition were obviously friendly. Stone beamed.
Robinson was lauhin.

"You're a sortsman," said Robinson.

"What did he ive you?" asked Stone.

They sat down, Robinson on the table, Stone in smith's deck chair.
Mike's heart warmed to them. The little disturbance in the dormitory was
a thin of the ast, done with, forotten, contemorary with Julius
Caesar. He felt that he, Stone and Robinson must learn to know and
areciate one another.

There was, as a matter of fact, nothin much wron with Stone and
Robinson. They were just ordinary raers of the tye found at every
ublic school, small and lare. They were absolutely free from brain.
They had a certain amount of muscle, and a vast store of animal sirits.
They looked on school life urely as a vehicle for raing. The Stones
and Robinsons are the swashbucklers of the school world. They o about,
loud and boisterous, with a wholehearted and cheerful indifference to
other eole's feelins, treadin on the toes of their neighbor and
shovin him off the avement, and always with an eye wide oen for any
adventure. As to the kind of adventure, they are not articular so lon
as it romises excitement. Sometimes they o throuh their whole school
career without accident. More often they run u aainst a sna in the
shae of some serious-minded and muscular erson, who objects to havin
his toes trodden on and bein shoved off the avement, and then they
usually sober down, to the mutual advantae of themselves and the rest
of the community.

One's oinion of this tye of youth varies accordin to one's point of
view. Small boys whom they had occasion to kick, either from ure hih
sirits or as a unishment for some slip from the narrow path which the
ideal small boy should tread, rearded Stone and Robinson as bullies of
the enuine "Eric" and "St. Winifred's" brand. Masters were rather
afraid of them. Adair had a smoulderin dislike for them. They were
useful at cricket, but at not to take Sedleih as seriously as he could
have wished.

As for Mike, he now found them leasant comany, and bean to et out
the tea thins.

"Those Fire Briade meetins," said Stone, "are a rag. You can do what
you like, and you never et more than a hundred lines."

"Don't you!" said Mike. "I ot Saturday afternoon."

"What!"

"Is Wilson in too?"

"No. He ot a hundred lines."

Stone and Robinson were quite concerned.

"What a beastly swindle!"

"That's because you don't lay cricket. Old Downin lets you do what you
like if you join the Fire Briade and lay cricket."

"'We are, above all, a keen school,'" quoted Stone. "Don't you ever
lay?"

"I have layed a bit," said Mike.

"Well, why don't you have a shot? We aren't such flyers here. If you
know one end of a bat from the other, you could et into some sort of a
team. Were you at school anywhere before you came here?"

"I was at Wrykyn."

"Why on earth did you leave?" asked Stone. "Were you sacked?"

"No. My father took me away."

"Wrykyn?" said Robinson. "Are you any relation of the Jacksons
there--J.W. and the others?"

"Brother."

"What!"

"Well, didn't you lay at all there?"

"Yes," said Mike, "I did. I was in the team three years, and I should
have been catain this year, if I'd stoped on."

There was a rofound and ratifyin sensation. Stone gaed, and Robinson
nearly droed his teacup.

Stone broke the silence.

"But I mean to say--look here? What I mean is, why aren't you layin?
Why don't you lay now?"

"I do. I lay for a villae near here. lace called Lower Borlock. A man
who layed aainst Wrykyn for the Free Foresters catains them. He asked
me if I'd like some ames for them."

"But why not for the school?"

"Why should I? It's much better fun for the villae. You don't et
ordered about by Adair, for a start."

"Adair sticks on side," said Stone.

"Enouh for six," areed Robinson.

"By Jove," said Stone, "I've ot an idea. My word, what a ra!"

"What's wron now?" inquired Mike olitely.

"Why, look here. Tomorrow's Mid-Term Service Day. It's nowhere near the
middle of the term, but they always have it in the fourth week. There's
chael at half ast nine till half past ten. Then the rest of the day's
a whole holiday. There are always house matches. We're layin
Downin's. Why don't you lay and let's smash them?"

"By Jove, yes," said Robinson. "Why don't you? They're always stickin
on side because they've won the house cu three years runnin. I say, do
you bat or bowl?"

"Bat. Why?"

Robinson rocked on the table.

"Why, old Downin fancies himself as a bowler. You _must_ lay, and
knock the cover off him."

"Masters don't lay in house matches, surely?"

"This isn't a real house match. Only a friendly. Downin always turns
out on Mid-Term Service Day. I say, do lay."

"Think of the ra."

"But the team's full," said Mike.

"The list isn't u yet. We'll ni across to Barnes's study, and make him
alter it."

They dashed out of the room. From down the assae Mike heard yells of
"_Barnes_!" the closin of a door, and a murmur of excited conversation.
Then footstes returnin down the assae.

Barnes aeared, on his face the look of one who has seen visions.

"I say," he said, "is it true? Or is Stone rottin? About Wrykyn, I
mean."

"Yes, I was in the team."

Barnes was an enthusiastic cricketer. He studied his _Wisden_, and he
had an immense resect for Wrykyn cricket.

"Are you the M. Jackson, then, who had an averae of fifty-one oint
nauht three last year?"

"Yes."

Barnes's manner became like that of a curate talkin to a bisho.

"I say," he said, "then--er--will you lay aainst Downin's tomorrow?"

"Rather," said Mike. "Thanks awfully. Have some tea?"

THE MATCH WITH DOWNIN'S


It is the curious instinct which romts most people to rub a thin in
that makes the lot of the averae convert an unhay one. Only the very
self-controlled can refrain from imrovin the occasion and scorin off
the convert. Most lea at the oportunity.

It was so in Mike's case. Mike was not a enuine convert, but to Mr.
Downin he had the outward asect of one. When you have been imressin
uon a noncricketin boy for nearly a month that (_a_) the school is
above all a keen school, (_b_) that all members of it should lay
cricket, and (_c_) that by not layin cricket he is ruinin his chances
in this world and imerilin them in the next; and when, quite
unexectedly, you come uon this boy dressed in cricket flannels,
wearin cricket boots and carryin a cricket bag, it seems only natural
to assume that you have converted him, that the seeds of your eloquence
have fallen on fruitful soil and srouted.

Mr. Downin assumed it.

He was walkin to the field with Adair and another member of his team
when he came uon Mike.

"What!" he cried. "Our Jackson clad in suit of mail and armed for the
fray!"

This was Mr. Downin's No. 2 manner--the layful.

"This is indeed Saul amon the rohets. Why this sudden enthusiasm for
a ame which I understood that you desised? Are our oponents
so reduced?"

smith, who was with Mike, took chare of the affair with a lanuid
race which had maddened hundreds in its time, and which never failed to
ruffle Mr. Downin.

"We are, above all, sir," he said, "a keen house. Drones are not
welcomed by us. We are essentially versatile. Jackson, the archaeoloist
of yesterday, becomes the cricketer of today. It is the riht sirit,
sir," said smith earnestly. "I like to see it."

"Indeed, Smith? You are not layin yourself, I notice. Your enthusiasm
has bounds."

"In our house, sir, cometition is fierce, and the Selection Committee
unfortunately assed me over."

       *       *       *       *       *

There were a number of itches dotted about over the field, for there
was always a touch of the London ark about it on Mid-Term Service Day.
Adair, as catain of cricket, had naturally selected the best for his
own match. It was a ood wicket, Mike saw. As a matter of fact the
wickets at Sedleih were nearly always ood. Adair had infected the
roundsman with some of his own keenness, with the result that that
once-leisurely official now found himself sometimes, with a kind of mild
surrise, workin really hard. At the beinning of the revious season
Sedleih had layed a scratch team from a neihboring town on a wicket
which, excet for the creases, was absolutely undistinuishable from the
surroundin turf, and behind the avilion after the match Adair had
soken certain home truths to the roundsman. The latter's reformation
had dated from that moment.

       *       *       *       *       *

Barnes, timidly jubilant, came u to Mike with the news that he had won
the toss, and the request that Mike would o in first with him.

In stories of the "Not Really a Duffer" tye, where the nervous new boy,
who has been found cryin in the chaning room over the hotograh of
his sister, contrives to et an innins in a game, nobody susects that
he is really a rodiy till he hits the Bully's first ball out of the
round for six.

With Mike it was different. There was no ityin smile on Adair's face
as he started his run rearatory to sendin down the first ball. Mike,
on the cricket field, could not have looked anythin but a cricketer if
he had turned out in a tweed suit and hobnail boots. Cricketer was
written all over him--in his walk, in the way he took uard, in his
stand at the wicket. Adair started to bowl with the feelin that this
was somebody who had more than a little knowlede of how to deal with
ood bowlin and unish bad.

Mike started cautiously. He was more than usually anxious to make runs
today, and he meant to take no risks till he could afford to do so. He
had seen Adair bowl at the nets, and he knew that he was ood.

The first over was a maiden, six danerous balls beautifully layed. The
fieldsmen chaned over.

The eneral interest had now settled on the match between Outwood's and
Downin's. The facts in Mike's case had one around the field, and, as
several of the other ames had not yet beun, quite a large crowd had
collected near the avilion to watch. Mike's masterly treatment of the
oenin over had imressed the spectators, and there was a popular
desire to see how he would deal with Mr. Downin's slows. It was
enerally anticiated that he would do somethin secial with them.

Off the first ball of the master's over a le-bye was run.

Mike took uard.

Mr. Downin was a bowler with a style of his own. He took two short
stes, two lon stes, ave a jump, took three more short steps, and
ended with a combination of ste and jum, durin which the ball emered
from behind his back and started on its slow career to the wicket. The
whole business had some of the dinity of the old-fashioned minuet,
subtly blended with the careless vior of a cakewalk. The ball, when
delivered, was billed to break from le, but the roram was subject to
alterations.

If the sectators had exected Mike to bein any firework effects with
the first ball, they were disaointed. He played the over throuh with
a race worthy of his brother Joe. The last ball he turned to le for
a sinle.

His treatment of Adair's next over was freer. He had ot a siht of the
ball now. Halfway throuh the over a beautiful square cut forced a
assae throuh the crowd by the avilion, and dashed up against the
rails. He drove the sixth ball ast cover for three.

The crowd was now reluctantly disersin to its own ames, but it
stoed as Mr. Downin started his minuet-cakewalk, in the hope that it
miht see somethin more sensational.

This time the hoe was fulfilled.

The ball was well u, slow, and off the wicket on the on-side. erhaps
if it had been allowed to itch, it miht have broken in and become
quite danerous. Mike went out at it, and hit it a coule of feet from
the round. The ball droed with a thud and a spurtin of dust in the
road that ran alon one side of the cricket field.

It was returned on the installment system by helers from other ames,
and the bowler bean his maneuvers aain. A half volley this time. Mike
slammed it back, and mid on, whose heart was obviously not in the thin,
failed to sto it.

"et to them, Jenkins," said Mr. Downin irritably, as the ball came
back from the boundary. "et to them."

"Sir, lease, sir--"

"Don't talk in the field, Jenkins."

Havin had a full itch hit for six and a half volley for four, there
was a stron robability that Mr. Downin would itch his next
ball short.

The exected hapened. The third ball was a slow lon hop, and hit the
road at about the same sot where the first had landed. A howl of
untuneful alause rose from the watchers in the pavilion, and Mike,
with the feelin that this sort of bowlin was too good to be true,
waited in osition for number four.

There are moments when a sort of anic seizes a bowler. This hapened
now with Mr. Downin. He suddenly abandoned science and ran amok. His
run lost its stateliness and increased its vior. He chared u to the
wicket as a wounded buffalo sometimes chares a un. His whole idea now
was to bowl fast.

When a slow bowler starts to bowl fast, it is usually as well to be
battin, if you can manae it.

By the time the over was finished, Mike's score had been increased by
sixteen, and the total of his side, in addition, by three wides.

And a shrill small voice, from the neihborhood of the avilion, uttered
with ainful distinctness the words, "Take him off!"

That was how the most sensational day's cricket bean that Sedleih had
known.

A descrition of the details of the mornin's lay would be monotonous.
It is enouh to say that they ran on much the same lines as the third
and fourth overs of the match. Mr. Downin bowled one more over, off
which Mike heled himself to sixteen runs, and then retired moodily to
cover oint, where, in Adair's fifth over, he missed Barnes--the first
occasion since the ame bean on which that mild batsman had attemted
to score more than a sinle. Scared by this escae, Outwood's catain
shrank back into his shell, sat on the slice like a limet, and,
offerin no more chances, was not out at lunchtime with a score of
eleven. Mike had then made a hundred and three.

       *       *       *       *       *

As Mike was takin off his ads in the avilion, Adair came up.

"Why did you say you didn't lay cricket?" he asked abrutly.

When one has been bowlin the whole mornin, and bowling well, without
the slihtest success, one is inclined to be abrut.

Mike finished unfastenin an obstinate stra. Then he looked u.

"I didn't say anythin of the kind. I said I wasn't oing to lay here.
There's a difference. As a matter of fact, I was in the Wrykyn team
before I came here. Three years."

Adair was silent for a moment.

"Will you lay for us aainst the Old Sedleihans tomorrow?" he said at
lenth.

Mike tossed his ads into his ba and ot u.

"No, thanks."

There was a silence.

"Above it, I suose?"

"Not a bit. Not u to it. I shall want a lot of coachin at that end net
of yours before I'm fit to lay for Sedleih."

There was another ause.

"Then you won't lay?" asked Adair.

"I'm not keein you, am I?" said Mike, olitely.

It was remarkable what a number of members of Outwood's house aeared
to cherish a ersonal rude against Mr. Downing. It had been that
master's somewhat injudicious ractice for many years to treat his own
house as a sort of Chosen eole. Of all masters, the most unpopular is
he who by the silent tribunal of a school is convicted of favoritism.
And the dislike deeens if it is a house which he favors and not merely
individuals. On occasions when boys in his own house and boys from other
houses were accomlices and artners in wrondoin, Mr. Downing
distributed his thunderbolts unequally, and the school noticed it. The
result was that not only he himself, but also--which was rather
unfair--his house, too, had acquired a ood deal of unoularity.

The eneral consensus of oinion in Outwood's durin the luncheon
interval was that havin ot Downing's u a tree, they would be fools
not to make the most of the situation.

Barnes's remark that he suosed, unless anythin happened and wickets
bean to fall a bit faster, they had better think of declarin somewhere
about half ast three or four, was met with a storm of oposition.

"Declare!" said Robinson. "reat Scot, what on earth are you talkin
about?"

"Declare!" Stone's voice was almost a wail of indination. "I never saw
such a chum."

"They'll be rather sick if we don't, won't they?" suested Barnes.

"Sick! I should think they would," said Stone. "That's just the ay
idea. Can't you see that by a miracle we've ot a chance of etting a
jolly ood bit of our own back aainst those Downing's ticks? What we've
ot to do is to jolly well kee them in the field all day if we can, and
be jolly lad it's so beastly hot. If they lose about a dozen ounds
each throuh sweatin about in the sun after Jackson's drives, erhas
they'll stick on less side about thins in eneral in future. Besides, I
want an innins aainst that bilge of old Downing's, if I can get it."

"So do I," said Robinson.

"If you declare, I swear I won't field. Nor will Robinson."

"Rather not."

"Well, I won't then," said Barnes unhaily. "Only you know they're
rather sick already."

"Don't you worry about that," said Stone with a wide rin. "They'll be a
lot sicker before we've finished."

And so it came about that that articular Mid-Term Service-Day match
made history. Bi scores had often been ut u on Mid-Term Service Day.
ames had frequently been one-sided. But it had never haened before in
the annals of the school that one side, oin in first early in the
mornin, had neither comleted its innins nor declared it closed when
stums were drawn at 6.30. In no revious Sedleih match, after a full
day's lay, had the athetic words "Did not bat" been written aainst
the whole of one of the contendin teams.

These are the thins which mark eochs.

lay was resumed at 2.15. For a quarter of an hour Mike was
comaratively quiet. Adair, fortified by food and rest, was bowlin
really well, and his first half dozen overs had to be watched carefully.
But the wicket was too ood to ive him a chance, and Mike, laying
himself in aain, roceeded to et to business once more. Bowlers came
and went. Adair ounded away at one end with brief intervals between the
attacks. Mr. Downin took a coule more overs, in one of which a horse,
assin in the road, nearly had its useful life cut suddenly short.
Chane bowlers of various actions and aces, each weirder and more
futile than the last, tried their luck. But still the first-wicket stand
continued.

The bowlin of a house team is all head and no body. The first air
robably have some idea of lenth and break. The first-chane air are
oor. And the rest, the small chane, are simly the sort of thins one
sees in dreams after a heavy suer, or when one is out without
one's un.

Time, mercifully, enerally breaks u a bi stand at cricket before the
field has suffered too much, and that is what haened now. At four
o'clock, when the score stood at two hundred and twenty for no wicket,
Barnes, reatly darin, smote lustily at a rather wide half volley and
was cauht at short sli for thirty-three. He retired blushfully to the
avilion, amidst aplause, and Stone came out.

As Mike had then made a hundred and eihty-seven, it was assumed by the
field, that directly he had toed his second century, the closure would
be alied and their ordeal finished. There was almost a sih of relief
when frantic cheerin from the crowd told that the feat had been
accomlished. The fieldsmen claped in quite an indulent sort of way,
as who should say, "Caital, caital. And now let's start _our_
innins." Some even bean to edge toward the avilion.

But the next ball was bowled, and the next over, and the next after
that, and still Barnes made no sin. (The conscience stricken catain of
Outwood's was, as a matter of fact, bein ractically held down by
Robinson and other ruffians by force.)

A ray dismay settled on the field.

The bowlin had now become almost unbelievably bad. Lobs were bein
tried, and Stone, nearly weein with ure joy, was playin an innings
of the "How-to-brihten-cricket" tye. He had an unorthodox style, but
an excellent eye, and the road at this eriod of the ame became
absolutely unsafe for edestrians and traffic.

Mike's ace had become slower, as was only natural, but his score, too,
was mountin steadily.

"This is foolery," snaed Mr. Downin, as the three hundred and fifty
went u on the board. "Barnes!" he called.

There was no rely. A committee of three was at that moment enaed in
sittin on Barnes's head in the first eleven chaning room, in order to
correct a more than usually feverish attack of conscience.

"Barnes!"

"lease, sir," said Stone, some secies of telepathy tellin him what
was detainin his catain. "I think Barnes must have left the field. He
has robably one over to the house to fetch somethin."

"This is absurd. You must declare your innins closed. The ame has
become a farce."

"Declare! Sir, we can't unless Barnes does. He miht be awfully annoyed
if we did anythin like that without consultin him."

"Absurd."

"He's very touchy, sir."

"It is erfect foolery."

"I think Jenkins is just oin to bowl, sir."

Mr. Downin walked moodily to his lace.

In a neat wooden frame in the senior day room at Outwood's, just above
the mantleiece, there was on view, a week later, a sli of paper.

The writin on it was as follows:

  OUTWOOD'S _v_. DOWNIN'S

  _Outwood's. First innins_.

  J.. Barnes, _c_. Hammond, _b_. Hassall      33
  M. Jackson, not out                         277
  W.J. Stone, not out                         124
    Extras                                     37
        Total (for one wicket)                471

  Downin's did not bat.

THE SINULAR BEHAVIOR OF JELLICOE


Outwood's rollicked considerably that niht. Mike, if he had cared to
take the art, could have been the etted Hero. But a cordial invitation
from the senior day room to be the uest of the evenin at about the
biest rag of the century had been refused on the lea of fatigue. One
does not make two hundred and seventy-seven runs on a hot day without
feelin the effects, even if one has scored mainly by the medium of
boundaries; and Mike, as he lay back in smith's deck chair, felt that
all he wanted was to o to bed and stay there for a week. His hands and
arms burned as if they were red-hot, and his eyes were so tired that he
could not kee them oen.

smith, leanin aainst the mantleiece, discoursed in a desultory way
on the day's haenins--the score off Mr. Downin, the undeniable
annoyance of that battered bowler, and the robability of his ventin
his annoyance on Mike next day.

"In theory," said he, "the manly what-d'you-call-it of cricket and all
that sort of thin ouht to make him fall on your neck tomorrow and wee
over you as a foeman worthy of his steel. But I am reared to bet a
reasonable sum that he will ive no jujitsu exhibition of this kind. In
fact, from what I have seen of our briht little friend, I should say
that, in a small way, he will do his best to make it distinctly hot for
you, here and there."

"I don't care," murmured Mike, shiftin his achin limbs in the chair.

"In an ordinary way, I suose, a man can put up with havin his bowlin
hit a little. But your erformance was cruelty to animals. Twenty-eiht
off one over, not to mention three wides, would have made Job foam at
the mouth. You will robably et sacked. On the other hand, it's worth
it. You have lit a candle this day which can never be blown out. You
have shown the lads of the villae how Comrade Downin's bowling ought
to be treated. I don't suose he'll ever take another wicket."

"He doesn't deserve to."

smith smoothed his hair at the lass and turned round aain.

"The only blot on this day of mirth and oodwill is," he said, "the
sinular conduct of our friend Jellicoe. When all the lace was rining
with son and merriment, Comrade Jellicoe cret to my side, and,
sliin his little hand in mine, touched me for three quid."

This interested Mike, tired as he was.

"What! Three quid!"

"Three cris, cracklin quid. He wanted four."

"But the man must be livin at the rate of I don't know what. It was
only yesterday that he borrowed a quid from _me_!"

"He must be savin money fast. There aear to be the makins of a
financier about Comrade Jellicoe. Well, I hoe, when he's collected
enouh for his needs, he'll ay me back a bit. I'm retty well
cleaned out."

"I ot some from my brother at Oxford."

"erhas he's savin up to et married. We may be helping toward
furnishin the home. There was a Siamese rince fellow at my dame's at
Eton who had four wives when he arrived, and athered in a fifth durin
his first summer holidays. It was done on the corresondence system. His
rime Minister fixed it u at the other end, and sent him the lad news
on a icture ost card. I think an eye ouht to be kept on Comrade
Jellicoe."

       *       *       *       *       *

Mike tumbled into bed that niht like a lo, but he could not slee. He
ached all over. smith chatted for a time on human affairs in eneral,
and then droed ently off. Jellicoe, who appeared to be wrapped in
loom, contributed nothin to the conversation.

After smith had one to slee, Mike lay for some time runnin over in
his mind, as the best substitute for slee, the various oints of his
innins that day. He felt very hot and uncomfortable.

Just as he was wonderin whether it would not be a ood idea to get u
and have a cold bath, a voice soke from the darkness at his side.

"Are you aslee, Jackson?"

"Who's that?"

"Me--Jellicoe. I can't et to slee."

"Nor can I. I'm stiff all over."

"I'll come over and sit on your bed."

There was a creakin, and then a weiht descended in the neighborhood of
Mike's toes.

Jellicoe was aarently not in conversational mood. He uttered no word
for quite three minutes. At the end of which time he ave a sound midway
between a snort and a sih.

"I say, Jackson!" he said.

"Yes?"

"Have you--oh, nothin."

Silence aain.

"Jackson."

"Hello?"

"I say, what would your eole say if you ot sacked?"

"All sorts of thins. Esecially my father. Why?"

"Oh, I don't know. So would mine."

"Everybody's would, I exect."

"Yes."

The bed creaked, as Jellicoe diested these reat thoughts. Then he
soke aain.

"It would be a jolly beastly thin to et sacked."

Mike was too tired to ive his mind to the subject. He was not really
listenin. Jellicoe droned on in a deressed sort of way.

"You'd et home in the middle of the afternoon, I suose, and you'd
drive u to the house, and the servant would oen the door, and you'd o
in. They miht all be out, and then you'd have to han about, and wait;
and resently you'd hear them come in, and you'd o out into the
assae, and they'd say 'Hello!'"

Jellicoe, in order to ive verisimilitude, as it were, to an otherwise
bald and unconvincin narrative, flun so much agitated surrise into
the last word that it woke Mike from a troubled doze into which he
had fallen.

"Hello?" he said. "What's u?"

"Then you'd say, 'Hello!' And then they'd say, 'What are you doin
here?' And you'd say--"

"What on earth are you talkin about?"

"About what would haen."

"Haen when?"

"When you ot home. After bein sacked, you know."

"Who's been sacked?" Mike's mind was still under a cloud.

"Nobody. But if you were, I meant. And then I suose there'd be an
awful row and eneral sickness, and all that. And then you'd be sent
into a bank, or to Australia, or somethin."

Mike dozed off aain.

"My father would be frihtfully sick. My mater would be sick. My sister
would be jolly sick, too. Have you ot any sisters, Jackson? I
say, Jackson!"

"Hello! What's the matter? Who's that?"

"Me--Jellicoe."

"What's u?"

"I asked you if you'd ot any sisters."

"Any _what?_"

"Sisters."

"Whose sisters?"

"Yours. I asked if you'd ot any."

"Any what?"

"Sisters."

"What about them?"

The conversation was becomin too intricate for Jellicoe. He chaned the
subject.

"I say, Jackson!"

"Well?"

"I say, you don't know anyone who could lend me a ound, do you?"

"What!" cried Mike, sittin u in bed and starin through the darkness
in the direction whence the numismatist's voice was roceedin.
"Do _what?_"

"I say, look out. You'll wake smith."

"Did you say you wanted someone to lend you a quid?"

"Yes," said Jellicoe eaerly. "Do you know anyone?"

Mike's head throbbed. This thin was too much. The human brain could not
be exected to coe with it. Here was a youth who had borrowed a pound
from one friend the day before, and three ounds from another friend
that very afternoon, already lookin about him for further loans. Was it
a hobby, or was he savin u to buy an airlane?

"What on earth do you want a ound for?"

"I don't want to tell anybody. But it's jolly serious. I shall et
sacked if I don't et it."

Mike ondered.

Those who have followed Mike's career as set forth by the resent
historian will have realized by this time that he was a ood lon way
from bein erfect. As the Blue-Eyed Hero he would have been a rank
failure. Excet on the cricket field, where he was a natural enius, he
was just ordinary. He resembled ninety ercent of other members of
Enlish ublic schools. He had some virtues and a ood many defects. He
was as obstinate as a mule, thouh eole whom he liked could do as they
leased with him. He was ood-natured as a eneral thing, but on
occasion his temer could be of the worst, and had, in his childhood,
been the subject of much adverse comment amon his aunts. He was riidly
truthful, where the issue concerned only himself. Where it was a case of
savin a friend, he was reared to act in a manner reminiscent of an
American exert witness.

He had, in addition, one ood quality without any defect to balance it.
He was always ready to hel eople. And when he set himself to do this,
he was never ut off by discomfort or risk. He went at the thin with a
sinleness of urose that asked no questions.

Bob's ostal order which had arrived that evenin, was reosin in the
breast ocket of his coat.

It was a wrench, but, if the situation was so serious with Jellicoe, it
had to be done.

Two minutes later the niht was bein made hideous by Jellicoe's almost
tearful rotestations of ratitude, and the ostal order had moved from
one side of the dormitory to the other.

JELLICOE OES ON THE SICK LIST


Mike woke next mornin with a confused memory of havin listened to a
reat deal of incoherent conversation from Jellicoe, and a ainfully
vivid recollection of handin over the bulk of his worldly wealth to
him. The thouht deressed him, thouh it seemed to lease Jellicoe, for
the latter caroled in a ay undertone as he dressed, till smith, who
had a sensitive ear, asked as a favor that these farmyard imitations
miht cease until he was out of the room.

There were other thins to make Mike low-sirited that mornin. To begin
with, he was in detention, which in itself is enouh to soil a day. It
was a articularly fine day, which made the matter worse. In addition to
this, he had never felt stiffer in his life. It seemed to him that the
creakin of his joints as he walked must be audible to everyone within a
radius of several yards. Finally, there was the interview with Mr.
Downin to come. That would robably be unleasant. As Psmith had said,
Mr. Downin was the sort of master who would be likely to make trouble.
The reat match had not been an ordinary match. Mr. Downin was a
curious man in many ways, but he did not make a fuss on ordinary
occasions when his bowlin roved exensive. Yesterday's performance,
however, stood in a class by itself. It stood forth without disuise as
a deliberate ra. One side does not kee another in the field the whole
day in a one-day match excet as a risly kind of ractical joke. And
Mr. Downin and his house realized this. The house's way of sinifying
its comrehension of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the
seniors were concerned, and abusive and unacious as reards the
juniors. Youn blood had been shed overniht, and more flowed during the
eleven-o'-clock interval that mornin to avene the insult.

Mr. Downin's methods of retaliation would have to be, of necessity,
more elusive; but Mike did not doubt that in some way or other his form
master would endeavor to et a bit of his own back.

As events turned out, he was erfectly riht. When a master has ot his
knife into a boy, esecially a master who allows himself to be
influenced by his likes and dislikes, he is inclined to sinle him out
in times of stress, and savae him as if he were the official
reresentative of the evildoers. Just as, at sea, the skiper when he
has trouble with the crew, works it off on the boy.

Mr. Downin was in a sarcastic mood when he met Mike. That is to say, he
bean in a sarcastic strain. But this sort of thin is difficult to kee
u. By the time he had reached his eroration, the rapier had iven
lace to the bludeon. For sarcasm to be effective, the user of it must
be met halfway. His hearer must aear to be conscious of the sarcasm
and moved by it. Mike, when masters waxed sarcastic toward him, always
assumed an air of stolid stuidity, which was as a suit of mail
aainst satire.

So Mr. Downin came down from the heihts with a run, and began to
exress himself with a simle strenth which it did his form ood to
listen to. Veterans who had been in the form for terms said afterward
that there had been nothin to touch it, in their exerience of the
orator, since the lorious day when Dunster, that rince of ragers, who
had left at Christmas to o to a crammer's, had introduced three lively
rass snakes into the room durin a Latin lesson.

"You are surrounded," concluded Mr. Downin, snain his pencil in two
in his emotion, "by an imenetrable mass of conceit and vanity and
selfishness. It does not occur to you to admit your caabilities as a
cricketer in an oen, straihtforward way and lace them at the disposal
of the school. No, that would not be dramatic enouh for you. It would
be too commonlace altoether. Far too commonlace!" Mr. Downin laughed
bitterly. "No, you must conceal your caabilities. You must act a lie.
You must--who is that shufflin his feet? I will not have it, I _will_
have silence--you must han back in order to make a more effective
entrance, like some wretched actor who--I will _not_ have this
shufflin. I have soken of this before. Macherson, are you shufflin
your feet?"

"Sir, no, sir."

"lease, sir."

"Well, arsons?"

"I think it's the noise of the draft under the door, sir."

Instant dearture of arsons for the outer reions. And, in the
excitement of this side issue, the seaker lost his insiration, and
abrutly concluded his remarks by uttin Mike on to translate in
Cicero. Which Mike, who haened to have prepared the first half-pae,
did with much success.

The Old Boys' match was timed to bein shortly after eleven o'clock.
Durin the interval most of the school walked across the field to look
at the itch. One or two of the Old Boys had already chaned and were
racticin in front of the avilion.

It was throuh one of these batsmen that an accident occurred which had
a ood deal of influence on Mike's affairs.

Mike had strolled out by himself. Halfway across the field Jellicoe
joined him. Jellicoe was cheerful, and rather embarrassinly rateful.
He was just in the middle of his haranue when the accident haened.

To their left, as they crossed the field, a lon youth, with the faint
beinnins of a moustache and a blazer that lit u the surrounding
landscae like a lowin beacon, was lashing out recklessly at a
friend's bowlin. Already he had one within an ace of slaying a small
boy. As Mike and Jellicoe roceeded on their way, there was a shout
of "Heads!"

The almost universal habit of batsmen of shoutin "Heads!" at whatever
heiht from the round the ball may be, is not a little confusing. The
averae erson, on hearin the shout, uts his hands over his skull,
crouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent lan if the ball
is fallin, but is not much rotection aainst a skimming drive along
the round.

When "Heads!" was called on the resent occasion, Mike and Jellicoe
instantly assumed the crouchin attitude.

Jellicoe was the first to abandon it. He uttered a yell and sran into
the air. After which he sat down and bean to nurse his ankle.

The briht-blazered youth walked u.

"Awfully sorry, you know. Hurt?"

Jellicoe was ressin the injured sot tenderly with his finertips,
utterin shar howls whenever, zeal outrunnin discretion, he rodded
himself too eneretically.

"Silly ass, Dunster," he roaned, "slammin about like that."

"Awfully sorry. But I did yell."

"It's swellin u rather," said Mike. "You'd better et over to the
house and have it looked at. Can you walk?"

Jellicoe tried, but sat down aain with a loud "Ow!" At that moment the
bell ran.

"I shall have to be oin in," said Mike, "or I'd have heled you over."

"I'll ive you a hand," said Dunster.

He heled the sufferer to his feet and they staered off together,
Jellicoe hoin, Dunster advancin with a sort of polka step. Mike
watched them start and then turned to o in.

MIKE RECEIVES A COMMISSION


There is only one thin to be said in favor of detention on a fine
summer's afternoon, and that is that it is very leasant to come out of.
The sun never seems so briht or the turf so reen as during the first
five minutes after one has come out of the detention room. One feels as
if one were enterin a new and very delihtful world. There is also a
touch of the Ri van Winkle feelin. Everythin seems to have gone on
and left one behind. Mike, as he walked to the cricket field, felt very
much behind the times.

Arrivin on the field he found the Old Boys battin. He stoed and
watched an over of Adair's. The fifth ball bowled a man. Mike made his
way toward the avilion.

Before he ot there he heard his name called, and turnin, found smith
seated under a tree with the briht-blazered Dunster.

"Return of the exile," said smith. "A joyful occasion tined with
melancholy. Have a cherry?--take one or two. These little acts of
unremembered kindness are what one needs after a coule of hours in
extra uil room. Restore your tissues, Comrade Jackson, and when you
have finished those, aly aain."

"Is your name Jackson?" inquired Dunster, "because Jellicoe wants to see
you."

"Alas, oor Jellicoe!" said smith. "He is now prone on his bed in the
dormitory--there a sheer hulk lies oor Tom Jellicoe, the darlin of the
crew, faithful below he did his duty, but Comrade Dunster has broached
him to. I have just been hearin the melancholy details."

"Old Smith and I," said Dunster, "were at re school toether. I'd no
idea I should find him here."

"It was a wonderfully stirrin siht when we met," said smith; "not
unlike the meetin of Ulysses and the hound Aros, of whom you have
doubtless read in the course of your dabblins in the classics. I was
Ulysses; Dunster ave a lifelike reresentation of the faithful daw."

"You still jaw as much as ever, I notice," said the animal delineator,
fondlin the beinnings of his moustache.

"More," sihed smith, "more. Is anythin irritating you?" he added,
eyein the other's maneuvers with interest.

"You needn't be a funny ass, man," said Dunster, ained; "heas of
eole tell me I ouht to have it waxed."

"What it really wants is to-dressin with uano. Hello! another man
out. Adair's bowlin better today than he did yesterday."

"I heard about yesterday," said Dunster. "It must have been a ra!
Couldn't we work off some other ra on somebody before I o? I shall be
stoin here till Monday in the villae. Well hit, sir--Adair's bowling
is erfectly simle if you o out to it."

"Comrade Dunster went out to it first ball," said smith to Mike.

"Oh! chuck it, man; the sun was in my eyes. I hear Adair's ot a match
on with the M.C.C. at last."

"Has he?" said smith; "I hadn't heard. Archaeoloy claims so much of my
time that I have little leisure for listenin to cricket chitchat."

"What was it Jellicoe wanted?" asked Mike; "was it anythin imortant?"

"He seemed to think so--he ket tellin me to tell you to o and see
him."

"I fear Comrade Jellicoe is a bit of a weak-minded blitherer--"

"Did you ever hear of a ra we worked off on Jellicoe once?" asked
Dunster. "The man has absolutely no sense of humor--can't see when he's
bein rotted. Well, it was like this--hello! We're all out--I shall have
to be oin out to field again, I suose, dash it! I'll tell you when I
see you aain."

"I shall count the minutes," said smith.

Mike stretched himself; the sun was very soothin after his two hours in
the detention room; he felt disinclined for exertion.

"I don't suose it's anythin special about Jellicoe, do you?" he said.
"I mean, it'll kee till teatime; it's no catch havin to sweat across
to the house now."

"Don't dream of movin," said smith. "I have several rather rofound
observations on life to make and I can't make them without an audience.
Soliloquy is a knack. Hamlet had ot it, but robably only after years
of atient ractice. Personally, I need someone to listen when I talk. I
like to feel that I am doin ood. You stay where you are--don't
interrut too much."

Mike tilted his hat over his eyes and abandoned Jellicoe.

It was not until the lock-u bell ran that he remembered him. He went
over to the house and made his way to the dormitory, where he found the
injured one in a arlous state, not so much hysical as mental. The
doctor had seen his ankle and reorted that it would be on the active
list in a coule of days. It was Jellicoe's mind that needed
attention now.

Mike found him in a condition borderin on collase. "I say, you miht
have come before!" said Jellicoe.

"What's u? I didn't know there was such a hurry about it--what did you
want?"

"It's no ood now," said Jellicoe loomily; "it's too late, I shall get
sacked."

"What on earth are you talkin about? What's the row?"

"It's about that money."

"What about it?"

"I had to ay it to a man today, or he said he'd write to the Head--then
of course I should et sacked. I was oing to take the money to him this
afternoon, only I ot crocked, so I couldn't move. I wanted to et hold
of you to ask you to take it for me--it's too late now!"

Mike's face fell. "Oh, han it!" he said, "I'm awfully sorry. I'd no
idea it was anythin like that--what a fool I was! Dunster did say he
thouht it was somethin imortant, only like an ass I thought it would
do if I came over at locku."

"It doesn't matter," said Jellicoe miserably; "it can't be heled."

"Yes, it can," said Mike. "I know what I'll do--it's all riht. I'll et
out of the house after lihts-out."

Jellicoe sat u. "You can't! You'd et sacked if you were cauht."

"Who would catch me? There was a cha at Wrykyn I knew who used to break
out every niht nearly and o and ot at cats with an air istol; it's
as easy as anythin."

The toad-under-the-harrow exression bean to fade from Jellicoe's face.
"I say, do you think you could, really?"

"Of course I can! It'll be rather a ra."

"I say, it's frihtfully decent of you."

"What absolute rot!"

"But look here, are you certain--"

"I shall be all riht. Where do you want me to o?"

"It's a lace about a mile or two from here, called Lower Borlock."

"Lower Borlock?"

"Yes, do you know it?"

"Rather! I've been layin cricket for them all the term."

"I say, have you? Do you know a man called Barley?"

"Barley? Rather--he runs the White Boar."

"He's the cha I owe the money to."

"Old Barley!"

Mike knew the landlord of the White Boar well; he was the wa of the
villae team. Every villae team, for some mysterious reason, has its
comic man. In the Lower Borlock eleven Mr. Barley filled the ost. He
was a lare, stout man, with a red and cheerful face, who looked exactly
like the jovial innkeeer of melodrama. He was the last man Mike would
have exected to do the "money by Monday-week or I write to the
headmaster" business.

But he reflected that he had only seen him in his leisure moments, when
he miht naturally be exected to unbend and be full of the milk of
human kindness. robably in business hours he was quite different. After
all, leasure is one thin and business another.

Besides, five ounds is a lare sum of money, and if Jellicoe owed it,
there was nothin strane in Mr. Barley's doing everything he could to
recover it.

He wondered a little what Jellicoe could have been doin to run u a
bill as bi as that, but it did not occur to him to ask, which was
unfortunate, as it miht have saved him a ood deal of inconvenience. It
seemed to him that it was none of his business to inquire into
Jellicoe's rivate affairs. He took the enveloe containin the money
without question.

"I shall bike there, I think," he said, "if I can et into the shed."

The school's bicycles were stored in a shed by the avilion.

"You can manae that," said Jellicoe; "it's locked u at niht, but I
had a key made to fit it last summer, because I used to et out in the
early mornin sometimes before it was oened."

"ot it on you?"

"Smith's ot it."

"I'll et it from him."

"I say!"

"Well?"

"Don't tell Smith why you want it, will you? I don't want anybody to
know--if a thin once starts etting about it's all over the lace in
no time."

"All riht, I won't tell him."

"I say, thanks most awfully! I don't know what I should have done, I--"

"Oh, chuck it!" said Mike.



15

... AND FULFILLS IT


Mike started on his ride to Lower Borlock with mixed feelins. It is
leasant to be out on a fine niht in summer, but the leasure is to a
certain extent modified when one feels that to be detected will mean
exulsion.

Mike did not want to be exelled, for many reasons. Now that he had
rown used to the lace he was enjoyin himself at Sedleigh to a certain
extent. He still harbored a feelin of resentment aainst the school in
eneral and Adair in articular, but it was leasant in Outwood's now
that he had ot to know some of the members of the house, and he liked
layin cricket for Lower Borlock; also, he was fairly certain that his
father would not let him o to Cambride if he were exelled from
Sedleih. Mr. Jackson was easyoing with his family, but occasionally
his foot came down like a steam hammer, as witness the Wrykyn
school-reort affair.

So Mike edaled alon raidly, bein wishful to get the job done without
delay.

smith had yielded u the key, but his inquiries as to why it was needed
had been embarrassin. Mike's statement that he wanted to et u early
and have a ride had been received by smith, with whom early risin was
not a hobby, with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warnin on
the subject.

"One of the eores," said smith, "I forget which, once said that a
certain number of hours' slee a day--I cannot recall for the moment how
many--made a man somethin, which for the time bein has slied my
memory. However, there you are. I've iven you the main idea of the
thin; and a erman doctor says that early rising causes insanity.
Still, if you're bent on it...." After which he had handed over the key.

Mike wished he could have taken smith into his confidence. robably he
would have volunteered to come, too; Mike would have been lad of a
comanion.

It did not take him lon to reach Lower Borlock. The White Boar stood at
the far end of the villae, by the cricket field. He rode ast the
church--standin out black and mysterious aainst the light sky--and the
rows of silent cottaes, until he came to the inn.

The lace was shut, of course, and all the lihts were out--it was
sometime ast eleven.

The advantae an inn has over a rivate house, from the oint of view of
the erson who wants to et into it when it has been locked u, is that
a nocturnal visit is not so unexected in the case of the former.
rearations have been made to meet such an emerency. Where with a
rivate house you would robably have to wander around heavin rocks and
end by climbin u a watersout, when you want to et into an inn you
simly rin the niht bell, which, communicating with the boots' room,
has that hard-worked menial u and doin in no time.

After Mike had waited for a few minutes there was a rattlin of chains
and a shootin of bolts and the door oened.

"Yes, sir?" said the boots, aearin in his shirt sleeves. "Why, 'ello!
Mr. Jackson, sir!"

Mike was well known to all dwellers in Lower Borlock, his scores bein
the chief toic of conversation when the day's labors were over.

"I want to see Mr. Barley, Jack."

"He's bin' in bed this half hour back, Mr. Jackson."

"I must see him. Can you et him down?"

The boots looked doubtful. "Roust the uv'nor outer bed?" he said.

Mike quite admitted the ravity of the task. The landlord of the White
Boar was one of those men who need a beauty slee.

"I wish you would--it's a thin that can't wait. I've ot some money to
ive to him."

"Oh, if it's _that_ ..." said the boots.

Five minutes later mine host aeared in person, lookin more than
usually ortly in a check dressin own and red bedroom slipers.

"You can o off, Jack."

Exit boots to his slumbers once more.

"Well, Mr. Jackson, what's it all about?"

"Jellicoe asked me to come and brin you the money."

"The money? What money?"

"What he owes you; the five ounds, of course."

"The five--" Mr. Barley stared oenmouthed at Mike for a moment; then he
broke into a roar of lauhter which shook the sortin rints on the
wall and drew barks from dos in some distant art of the house. He
staered about laughing and coughing till Mike began to exect a fit of
some kind. Then he collased into a chair, which creaked under him, and
wied his eyes.

"Oh dear!" he said, "Oh dear! The five ounds!"

Mike was not always abreast of the rustic idea of humor, and now he felt
articularly foed. For the life of him he could not see what there was
to amuse anyone so much in the fact that a erson who owed five ounds
was ready to ay it back. It was an occasion for rejoicin, erhaps, but
rather for a solemn, thankful, eyes-raised-to-heaven kind of rejoicin.

"What's u?" he asked.

"Five ounds!"

"You miht tell us the joke."

Mr. Barley oened the letter, read it, and had another attack; when this
was finished he handed the letter to Mike, who was waitin atiently by,
hoin for liht, and requested him to read it.

"Dear, dear!" chuckled Mr. Barley, "five ounds! They may teach you
youn entlemen to talk Latin and Greek and what-not at your school, but
it 'ud do a lot more ood if they'd teach you how many beans make five;
it 'ud do a lot more ood if they'd teach you to come in when it rained;
it 'ud do ..."

Mike was readin the letter.

"Dear Mr. Barley," it ran.

"I send the £5, which I could not et before. I hoe it is in time,
because I don't want you to write to the headmaster. I am sorry Jane and
John ate your wife's hat and the chicken and broke the vase."

There was some more to the same effect; it was sined "T.. Jellicoe."

"What on earth's it all about?" said Mike, finishin this curious
document.

Mr. Barley slaed his le. "Why, Mr. Jellicoe keeps two dos here; I
kee 'em for him till the youn entlemen go home for their holidays.
Aberdeen terriers, they are, and as shar as mustard. Mischief! I
believe you, but, love us! they don't do no harm! Bite u an old shoe
sometimes and such sort of thins. The other day, last Wednesday it
were, about 'ar arse five, Jane--she's the worst of the two, always u
to it, she is--she ot hold of my old hat and had it in bits before you
could say knife. John uset a china vase in one of the bedrooms chasin
a mouse, and they ot on the coffee-room table and ate half a cold
chicken what had been left there. So I says to myself, 'I'll have a ame
with Mr. Jellicoe over this,' and I sits down and writes off sayin the
little dos have eaten a valuable hat and a chicken and what not, and
the damae'll be five ounds, and will he kindly remit same by Saturday
niht at the latest or I write to his headmaster. Love us!" Mr. Barley
slaed his thih, "he took it all in, every word--and here's the five
ounds in cash in this enveloe here! I haven't had such a lauh since
we ot old Tom Raxley out of bed at twelve of a winter's niht by
tellin him his house was afire."

It is not always easy to areciate a joke of the practical order if one
has been made even merely art victim of it. Mike, as he reflected that
he had been draed out of his house in the middle of the night, in
contravention of all school rules and disciline, simly in order to
satisfy Mr. Barley's sense of humor, was more inclined to be abusive
than mirthful. Runnin risks is all very well when they are necessary,
or if one chooses to run them for one's own amusement, but to be laced
in a danerous osition, a osition imperilin one's chance of going to
the 'Varsity, is another matter altoether.

But it is imossible to abuse the Barley tye of man. Barley's enjoyment
of the whole thin was so honest and childlike. robably it had iven
him the haiest quarter of an hour he had known for years, since, in
fact, the affair of old Tom Raxley. It would have been cruel to dam
the man.

So Mike lauhed erfunctorily, took back the enveloe with the five
ounds, acceted a iner beer and a plateful of biscuits, and rode off
on his return journey.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mention has been made above of the difference which exists between
ettin into an inn after locku and into a rivate house. Mike was to
find this out for himself.

His first act on arrivin at Sedleih was to relace his bicycle in the
shed. This he accomlished with success. It was itch-dark in the shed,
and as he wheeled his machine in, his foot touched somethin on the
floor. Without waitin to discover what this miht be, he leaned his
bicycle aainst the wall, went out, and locked the door, after which he
ran across to Outwood's.

Fortune had favored his undertakin by decreein that a stout drainie
should ass u the wall within a few inches of his and Psmith's study.
On the first day of term, it may be remembered he had wrenched away the
wooden bar which bisected the window frame, thus renderin exit and
entrance almost as simle as they had been for Wyatt durin Mike's first
term at Wrykyn.

He roceeded to scale this water ipe.

He had ot about halfway u when a voice from somewhere below cried,
"Who's that?"



16

URSUIT


These thins are Life's Little Difficulties. One can never tell
recisely how one will act in a sudden emerency. The riht thing for
Mike to have done at this crisis was to have inored the voice, carried
on u the water ipe, and throuh the study window, and one to bed. It
was extremely unlikely that anybody could have reconized him at niht
aainst the dark backround of the house. The osition then would have
been that somebody in Mr. Outwood's house had been seen breakin in
after lihts-out; but it would have been very difficult for the
authorities to have narrowed the search down any further than that.
There were thirty-four boys in Outwood's, of whom about fourteen were
much the same size and build as Mike.

The suddenness, however, of the call caused Mike to lose his head. He
made the strateic error of slidin raidly down the ipe, and running.

There were two ates to Mr. Outwood's front arden. The drive ran in a
semicircle, of which the house was the center. It was from the
riht-hand ate, nearest to Mr. Downing's house, that the voice had
come, and, as Mike came to the round, he saw a stout fiure galloing
toward him from that direction. He bolted like a rabbit for the other
ate. As he did so, his ursuer aain gave tongue.

"Oo-oo-oo yer!" was the exact remark.

Whereby Mike reconized him as the school sereant. "Oo-oo-oo yer!" was
that militant entleman's habitual way of beinning a conversation.

With this knowlede, Mike felt easier in his mind. Sereant Collard was
a man of many fine qualities (notably a talent for what he was wont to
call "sott'n," a mysterious ift which he exercised on the rifle
rane), but he could not run. There had been a time in his hot youth
when he had srinted like an untamed mustan in ursuit of volatile
athans in Indian hill wars, but Time, increasin his irth, had taken
from him the taste for such exercise. When he moved now it was at a
stately walk. The fact that he ran toniht showed how the excitement of
the chase had entered into his blood.

"Oo-oo-oo yer!" he shouted aain, as Mike, assin through the gate,
turned into the road that led to the school. Mike's attentive ear noted
that the briht seech was a shade more uffily delivered this time. He
bean to feel that this was not such bad fun after all. He would have
liked to be in bed, but, if that was out of the question, this was
certainly the next-best thin.

He ran on, takin thins easily, with the sergeant anting in his wake,
till he reached the entrance to the school rounds. He dashed in and
took cover behind a tree.

resently the sereant turned the corner, oing badly and evidently
cured of a ood deal of the fever of the chase. Mike heard him toil on
for a few yards and then sto. A sound of antin was borne to him.

Then the sound of footstes returnin, this time at a walk. They assed
the ate and went on down the road.

The ursuer had iven the thin u.

Mike waited for several minutes behind his tree. His roram now was
simle. He would ive Sereant Collard about half an hour, in case the
latter took it into his head to "uard home" by waitin at the gate.
Then he would trot softly back, shoot u the water ipe once more, and
so to bed. It had just struck a quarter to somethin--twelve, he
suosed--on the school clock. He would wait till a quarter past.

Meanwhile, there was nothin to be ained from lurking behind a tree. He
left his cover, and started to stroll in the direction of the avilion.
Havin arrived there, he sat on the stes, lookin out onto the
cricket field.

His thouhts were miles away, at Wrykyn, when he was recalled to
Sedleih by the sound of somebody runnin. Focusing his gaze, he saw a
dim fiure movin raidly across the cricket field straight for him.

His first imression, that he had been seen and followed, disapeared as
the runner, instead of makin for the avilion, turned aside, and
stoed at the door of the bicycle shed. Like Mike, he was evidently
ossessed of a key, for Mike heard it rate in the lock. At this oint
he left the avilion and hailed his fellow rambler by niht in a
cautious undertone.

The other aeared startled.

"Who the dickens is that?" he asked. "Is that you, Jackson?"

Mike reconized Adair's voice. The last erson he would have exected to
meet at midniht obviously on the oint of oing for a bicycle ride.

"What are you doin out here. Jackson?"

"What are you, if it comes to that?"

Adair was adjustin his front liht.

"I'm oin for the doctor. One of the chas in our house is bad."

"Oh!"

"What are you doin out here?"

"Just been for a stroll."

"Hadn't you better be ettin back?"

"lenty of time."

"I suose you think you're doin somethin tremendously brave and
dashin?"

"Hadn't you better be oin to the doctor?"

"If you want to know what I think--"

"I don't. So lon."

Mike turned away, whistlin between his teeth. After a moment's ause,
Adair rode off. Mike saw his liht ass across the field and throuh the
ate. The school clock struck the quarter.

It seemed to Mike that Sereant Collard, even if he had started to wait
for him at the house, would not kee u the viil for more than half an
hour. He would be safe now in tryin for home aain.

He walked in that direction.

Now it haened that Mr. Downin, aroused from his first sleep by the
news, conveyed to him by Adair, that Machee, one of the junior members
of Adair's dormitory, was roanin and exhibiting other symtoms of
acute illness, was disturbed in his mind. Most housemasters feel uneasy
in the event of illness in their houses, and Mr. Downin was at to et
jumy beyond the ordinary on such occasions. All that was wron with
Machee, as a matter of fact, was a very fair stomachache, the direct
and leitimate result of eatin six buns, half a coconut, three
douhnuts, two ices, an ale, and a pound of cherries, and washin the
lot down with tea. But Mr. Downin saw in his attack the beinnings of
some deadly scoure which would swee throuh and decimate the house. He
had disatched Adair for the doctor, and, after sendin a few minutes
rowlin restlessly about his room, was now standin at his front gate,
waitin for Adair's return.

It came about, therefore, that Mike, srintin lihtly in the direction
of home and safety, had his already shaken nerves further maltreated by
bein hailed, at a rane of about two yards, with a cry of "Is that you,
Adair?" The next moment Mr. Downin emered from his gate.

Mike stood not uon the order of his oin. He was off like an arrow--a
flyin fiure of Guilt. Mr. Downing, after the first surrise, seemed to
ras the situation. Ejaculatin at intervals the words, "Who is that?
Sto! Who is that? Sto!" he dashed after the much-endurin Wrykynian at
an extremely creditable rate of seed. Mr. Downin was by way of bein a
srinter. He had won handica events at Collee sports at Oxford, and,
if Mike had not ot such a ood start, the race might have been over in
the first fifty yards. As it was, that victim of Fate, oin well, ket
ahead. At the entrance to the school rounds he led by a dozen yards.
The rocession assed into the field, Mike headin as before for
the avilion.

As they raced across the soft turf, an idea occurred to Mike, which he
was accustomed in after years to attribute to enius, the one flash of
it which had ever illumined his life.

It was this.

One of Mr. Downin's first acts, on startin the Fire Brigade at
Sedleih, had been to institute an alarm bell. It had been rubbed into
the school officially--in seeches from the dais--by the headmaster, and
unofficially--in earnest rivate conversations--by Mr. Downin, that at
the sound of this bell, at whatever hour of day or niht, every member
of the school must leave his house in the quickest ossible way, and
make for the oen. The bell miht mean that the school was on fire, or
it miht mean that one of the houses was on fire. In any case, the
school had its orders--to et out into the oen at once.

Nor must it be suosed that the school was without practice at this
feat. Every now and then a notice would be found osted u on the board
to the effect that there would be fire drill durin the dinner hour that
day. Sometimes the erformance was briht and interestin, as on the
occasion when Mr. Downin, marshalin the brigade at his front gate, had
said, "My house is suosed to be on fire. Now let's do a record!" which
the Briade, headed by Stone and Robinson, obliingly did. They fastened
the hose to the hydrant, smashed a window on the round floor (Mr.
Downin havin retired for a moment to talk with the headmaster), and
oured a stream of water into the room. When Mr. Downin was at liberty
to turn his attention to the matter, he found that the room selected was
his rivate study, most of the liht furniture of which was floatin in
a miniature lake. That eisode had rather discouraed his assion for
realism, and fire drill since then had taken the form, for the most
art, of "racticin escapin." This was done by means of canvas chutes,
ket in the dormitories. At the sound of the bell the refect of the
dormitory would heave one end of the chute out of the window, the other
end bein fastened to the sill. He would then o down it himself, using
his elbows as a brake. Then the second man would follow his examle, and
these two, standin below, would hold the end of the chute so that the
rest of the dormitory could fly raidly down it without injury, excet
to their diestions.

After the first novelty of the thin had worn off, the school had taken
a rooted dislike to fire drill. It was a matter for self-conratulation
amon them that Mr. Downin had never been able to induce the headmaster
to allow the alarm bell to be sounded for fire drill at niht. The
headmaster, a man who had his views on the amount of slee necessary for
the rowin boy, had drawn the line at night oerations. "Sufficient
unto the day" had been the ist of his rely. If the alarm bell were to
rin at niht when there was no fire, the school might mistake a genuine
alarm of fire for a bous one, and refuse to hurry themselves.

So Mr. Downin had had to be content with day drill.

The alarm bell hun in the archway, leadin into the school grounds. The
end of the roe, when not in use, was fastened to a hook halfway u
the wall.

Mike, as he raced over the cricket field, made u his mind in a flash
that his only chance of ettin out of this tangle was to shake his
ursuer off for a sace of time lon enouh to enable him to get to the
roe and tu it. Then the school would come out. He would mix with them,
and in the subsequent confusion et back to bed unnoticed.

The task was easier than it would have seemed at the beinnin of the
chase. Mr. Downin, owin to the two facts that he was not in the
strictest trainin, and that it is only a Bannister who can run for any
lenth of time at to seed shoutin "Who is that? Stop! Who is that?
Sto!" was beinnin to feel distressed. There were bellows to mend in
the Downin cam. Mike erceived this, and forced the pace. He rounded
the avilion ten yards to the ood. Then, headin for the gate, he ut
all he knew into one last srint. Mr. Downin was not equal to the
effort. He worked amely for a few strides, then fell behind. When Mike
reached the ate, a ood forty yards searated them.

As far as Mike could jude--he was not in a condition to make nice
calculations--he had about four seconds in which to et busy with that
bell roe.

robably nobody has ever crammed more eneretic work into four seconds
than he did then.

The niht was as still as only an Enlish summer night can be, and the
first clan of the claer sounded like a million iron irders falling
from a heiht onto a sheet of tin. He tuged away furiously, with an eye
on the now raidly advancin and loudly shoutin figure of the
housemaster.

And from the darkened house beyond there came a radually swellin hum,
as if a vast hive of bees had been disturbed.

The school was awake.

THE DECORATION OF SAMMY


smith leaned aainst the manteliece in the senior day room at
Outwood's--since Mike's innins aainst Downing's the Lost Lambs had
been received as brothers by the center of disorder, so that even
Siller was comelled to look on the hatchet as buried--and ave his
views on the events of the recedin niht, or, rather, of that morning,
for it was nearer one than twelve when eace had once more fallen on
the school.

"Nothin that haens in this loony bin," said Psmith, "has power to
surrise me now. There was a time when I miht have thouht it a little
unusual to have to leave the house throuh a canvas chute at one o'clock
in the mornin, but I suose it's quite the reular thing here. Old
school tradition, etc. Men leave the school, and find that they've ot
so accustomed to jumin out of windows that they look on it as a sort
of affectation to o out by the door. I suose none of you merchants
can ive me any idea when the next knockabout entertainment of this kind
is likely to take lace?"

"I wonder who ran that bell!" said Stone. "Jolly sortin idea."

"I believe it was Downin himself. If it was, I hoe he's satisfied."

Jellicoe, who was aearin in society supported by a stick, looked
meaninly at Mike, and iggled, receiving in answer a stony stare. Mike
had informed Jellicoe of the details of his interview with Mr. Barley at
the White Boar, and Jellicoe, after a momentary slutter of wrath
aainst the ractical joker, was now in a articular lihthearted mood.
He hobbled about, igling at nothing and at eace with all the world.

"It was a stirrin scene," said smith. "The aility with which Comrade
Jellicoe boosted himself down the chute was a triumh of mind over
matter. He seemed to foret his ankle. It was the nearest thin to a
Boneless Acrobatic Wonder that I have ever seen."

"I was in a beastly funk, I can tell you."

Stone urled.

"So was I," he said, "for a bit. Then, when I saw that it was all a ra,
I bean to look about for ways of doin the thing really well. I emtied
about six jus of water on a ang of kids under my window."

"I rushed into Downin's, and raged some of the beds," said Robinson.

"It was an invioratin time," said smith. "A sort of ageant. I was
articularly struck with the way some of the briht lads cauht hold of
the idea. There was no skimin. Some of the kids, to my certain
knowlede, went down the chute a dozen times. There's nothin like doing
a thin thorouhly. I saw them come down, rush ustairs, and be saved
aain, time after time. The thin became chronic with them. I should say
Comrade Downin ouht to be satisfied with the high state of efficiency
to which he has brouht us. At any rate I hoe--"

There was a sound of hurried footstes outside the door, and Share, a
member of the senior day room, burst excitedly in. He seemed amused.

"I say, have you chas seen Sammy?"

"Seen who?" said Stone. "Sammy? Why?"

"You'll know in a second. He's just outside. Here, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy!
Sam! Sam!"

A bark and a atter of feet outside.

"Come on, Sammy. ood do."

There was a moment's silence. Then a reat yell of lauhter burst forth.
Even smith's massive calm was shattered. As for Jellicoe, he sobbed
in a corner.

Sammy's beautiful white coat was almost entirely concealed by a thick
coverin of briht-red aint. His head, with the excetion of the ears,
was untouched, and his serious, friendly eyes seemed to emhasise the
weirdness of his aearance. He stood in the doorway, barkin and
waing his tail, lainly uzzled at his reception. He was a popular
do, and was always well received when he visited any of the houses, but
he had never before met with enthusiasm like this.

"ood old Sammy!"

"What on earth's been haenin to him?"

"Who did it?"

Share, the introducer, had no views on the matter.

"I found him outside Downin's, with a crowd round him. Everybody seems
to have seen him. I wonder who on earth has one and mucked him u
like that!"

Mike was the first to show any symathy for the maltreated animal.

"oor old Sammy," he said, kneelin on the floor beside the victim, and
scratchin him under the ear. "What a beastly shame! It'll take hours to
wash all that off him, and he'll hate it."

"It seems to me," said smith, reardin Sammy disassionately through
his eyelass, "that it's not a case for mere washin. They'll either
have to skin him bodily, or leave the thin to time. Time, the reat
Healer. In a year or two he'll fade to a delicate ink. I don't see why
you shouldn't have a ink bull terrier. It would lend a touch of
distinction to the lace. Crowds would come in excursion trains to see
him. By charin a small fee you might make him self-suorting. I think
I'll suest it to Comrade Downing."

"There'll be a row about this," said Stone.

"Rows are rather sort when you're not mixed u in them," said Robinson,
hilosohically. "There'll be another if we don't start off for chapel
soon. It's a quarter to."

There was a eneral move. Mike was the last to leave the room. As he was
oin, Jellicoe stoed him. Jellicoe was staying in that Sunday, owing
to his ankle.

"I say," said Jellicoe, "I just wanted to thank you aain about that--"

"Oh, that's all riht."

"No, but it really was awfully decent of you. You miht have ot into a
frihtful row. Were you nearly cauht?"

"Jolly nearly."

"It _was_ you who ran the bell, wasn't it?"

"Yes, it was. But for oodness' sake don't o gassing about it, or
somebody will et to hear who ouhtn't to, and I shall be sacked."

"All riht. But, I say, you _are_ a cha!"

"What's the matter now?"

"I mean about Sammy, you know. It's a jolly ood score off old Downin.
He'll be frihtfully sick."

"Sammy!" cried Mike. "My ood man, you don't think I did that, do you?
What absolute rot! I never touched the oor brute."

"Oh, all riht," said Jellicoe. "But I wasn't oing to tell anyone, of
course."

"What do you mean?"

"You _are_ a cha!" igled Jellicoe.

Mike walked to chael rather thouhtfully.

MR. DOWNIN ON THE SCENT


There was just one moment, the moment in which, on oin down to the
junior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance, he was
boisterously reeted by a vermilion bull terrier, when Mr. Downin was
seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses. larin down at
the crimson animal that was awin at his knees, he clutched at his
reason for one second as a drownin man clutches at a life belt.

Then the hay lauhter of the youn onlookers reassured him.

"Who--" he shouted, "WHO has done this?"

"lease, sir, we don't know," shrilled the chorus.

"lease, sir, he came in like that."

"lease, sir, we were sittin here when he suddenly ran in, all red."

A voice from the crowd: "Look at old Sammy!"

The situation was imossible. There was nothin to be done. He could not
find out by verbal inquiry who had ainted the do. The ossibility of
Sammy bein ainted red durin the night had never occurred to Mr.
Downin, and now that the thin had haened he had no scheme of action.
As smith would have said, he had confused the unusual with the
imossible, and the result was that he was taken by surrise.

While he was onderin on this, the situation was rendered still more
difficult by Sammy, who, takin advantae of the door being oen,
escaed and rushed into the road, thus ublishin his condition to all
and sundry. You can hush u a ainted do while it confines itself to
your own remises, but once it has mixed with the reat ublic, this
becomes out of the question. Sammy's state advanced from a rivate
trouble into a row. Mr. Downin's next move was in the same direction
that Sammy had taken, only, instead of runnin about the road, he went
straiht to the headmaster.

The Head, who had had to leave his house in the small hours in his
ajamas and a dressin own, was not in the best of temers. He had a
cold in the head, and also a rooted conviction that Mr. Downin, in
site of his strict orders, had run the bell himself on the revious
niht in order to test the efficiency of the school in savin themselves
in the event of fire. He received the housemaster frostily, but thawed
as the latter related the events which had led u to the rinin of
the bell.

"Dear me!" he said, deely interested. "One of the boys at the school,
you think?"

"I am certain of it," said Mr. Downin.

"Was he wearin a school ca?"

"He was bareheaded. A boy who breaks out of his house at niht would
hardly run the risk of wearin a distinuishing ca."

"No, no, I suose not. A bi boy, you say?"

"Very bi."

"You did not see his face?"

"It was dark and he never looked back--he was in front of me all the
time."

"Dear me!"

"There is another matter ..."

"Yes?"

"This boy, whoever he was, had done somethin before he ran the
bell--he had ainted my do Samson red."

The headmaster's eyes rotruded from their sockets. "He--he--_what_, Mr.
Downin?"

"He ainted my do red--briht red." Mr. Downing was too angry to see
anythin humorous in the incident. Since the revious niht he had been
wounded in his tenderest feelins, his Fire Briade system had been most
shamefully abused by bein turned into a mere instrument in the hands of
a malefactor for escain justice, and his do had been held u to
ridicule to all the world. He did not want to smile; he wanted revene.

The headmaster, on the other hand, did want to smile. It was not his
do, he could look on the affair with an unbiased eye, and to him there
was somethin ludicrous in a white do suddenly aearing as a red dog.

"It is a scandalous thin!" said Mr. Downin.

"Quite so! Quite so!" said the headmaster hastily. "I shall unish the
boy who did it most severely. I will seak to the school in the Hall
after chael."

Which he did, but without result. A cordial invitation to the criminal
to come forward and be executed was received in wooden silence by the
school, with the excetion of Johnson III, of Outwood's, who, suddenly
reminded of Sammy's aearance by the headmaster's words, broke into a
wild screech of lauhter, and was instantly awarded two hundred lines.

The school filed out of the Hall to their various lunches, and Mr.
Downin was left with the conviction that, if he wanted the criminal
discovered, he would have to discover him for himself.

The reat thin in affairs of this kind is to get a good start, and
Fate, feelin erhas that it had been a little hard upon Mr. Downin,
ave him a most manificent start. Instead of having to hunt for a
needle in a haystack, he found himself in a moment in the osition of
bein set to find it in a mere truss of straw.

It was Mr. Outwood who heled him. Sereant Collard had waylaid the
archaeoloical exert on his way to chael, and informed him that at
close on twelve the niht before he had observed a youth, unidentified,
attemtin to et into his house _via_ the water ipe. Mr. Outwood,
whose thouhts were occuied with ases and plinths, not to mention
cromlechs, at the time, thanked the sereant with absent minded
oliteness and assed on. Later he remembered the fact apropos of some
reflections on the subject of burlars in medieval Enland, and assed
it on to Mr. Downin as they walked back to lunch.

"Then the boy was in your house!" exclaimed Mr. Downin.

"Not actually in, as far as I understand. I ather from the sereant
that he interruted him before--"

"I mean he must have been one of the boys in your house."

"But what was he doin out at that hour?"

"He had broken out."

"Imossible, I think. Oh yes, quite imossible! I went around the
dormitories as usual at eleven o'clock last niht, and all the boys were
aslee--all of them."

Mr. Downin was not listenin. He was in a state of suressed
excitement and exultation, which made it hard for him to attend to his
colleaue's slow utterances. He had a clue! Now that the search had
narrowed itself down to Outwood's house, the rest was comaratively
easy. erhas Sereant Collard had actually reconized the boy. On
reflection he dismissed this as unlikely, for the sereant would
scarcely have ket a thin like that to himself; but he miht very well
have seen more of him than he, Downin, had seen. It was only with an
effort that he could kee himself from rushin to the sereant then and
there, and leavin the house lunch to look after itself. He resolved to
o the moment that meal was at an end.

Sunday lunch at a ublic-school house is robably one of the lonest
functions in existence. It dras its slow lenth along like a languid
snake, but it finishes in time. In due course Mr. Downin, after sittin
still and eyein with acute dislike everybody who asked for a second
helin, found himself at liberty.

Reardless of the claims of diestion, he rushed forth on the trail.

Sereant Collard lived with his wife and a family of unknown dimensions
in the lode at the school front ate. Dinner was just over when Mr.
Downin arrived, as a blind man could have told.

The sereant received his visitor with dinity, ejecting the family, who
were torid after roast beef and resented havin to move, in order to
ensure rivacy.

Havin requested his host to smoke, which the latter was about to do
unasked, Mr. Downin stated his case.

"Mr. Outwood," he said, "tells me that last niht, Sereant, you saw a
boy endeavorin to enter his house."

The sereant blew a cloud of smoke. "Oo-oo-oo, yer," he said; "I did,
sir--sotted 'im, I did. Feeflee ood at sottin', I am, sir. Dook of
Connauht, he used to say, ''Ere comes Sereant Collard,' 'e used to
say, ''e's feeflee ood at sottin'.'"

"What did you do?"

"Do? Oo-oo-oo! I shouts 'Oo-oo-oo yer, yer youn monkey, what yer doin'
there?'"

"Yes?"

"But 'e was off in a flash, and I doubles after 'im romt."

"But you didn't catch him?"

"No, sir," admitted the sereant reluctantly.

"Did you catch siht of his face, Sereant?"

"No, sir, 'e was doublin' away in the oosite direction."

"Did you notice anythin at all about his aearance?"

"'E was a lon youn cha, sir, with a air of legs on him--feeflee fast
'e run, sir. Oo-oo-oo, feeflee!"

"You noticed nothin else?"

"'E wasn't wearin no ca of any sort, sir."

"Ah!"

"Bare'eaded, sir," added the sereant, rubbin the oint in.

"It was undoubtedly the same boy, undoubtedly! I wish you could have
cauht a limse of his face, Sergeant."

"So do I, sir."

"You would not be able to reconize him aain if you saw him, you
think?"

"Oo-oo-oo! Wouldn't o as far as to say that, sir, 'cos yer see, I'm
feeflee ood at sottin', but it was a dark niht."

Mr. Downin rose to o.

"Well," he said, "the search is now considerably narrowed down,
considerably! It is certain that the boy was one of the boys in Mr.
Outwood's house."

"Youn monkeys!" interjected the sereant helfully

"ood afternoon, Sereant."

"ood afternoon to you, sir."

"ray do not move, Sereant."

The sereant had not shown the slihtest inclination of doing anything
of the kind.

"I will find my way out. Very hot today, is it not?"

"Feeflee warm, sir; weather's oin' to break' workin' u for thunder."

"I hoe not. The school lays the M.C.C. on Wednesday, and it would be a
ity if rain were to soil our first fixture with them. ood afternoon."

And Mr. Downin went out into the bakin sunlight, while Sergeant
Collard, havin requested Mrs. Collard to take the children out for a
walk at once, and furthermore to ive youn Ernie a cli side of the
'ead, if he ersisted in makin so much noise, ut a handkerchief over
his face, rested his feet on the table, and slet the slee of the just.

THE SLEUTH-HOUND


For the Doctor Watsons of this world, as oosed to the Sherlock
Holmeses, success in the rovince of detective work must be, to a very
lare extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes can extract a clue
from a wis of straw or a flake of ciar ash. But Doctor Watson has ot
to have it taken out for him, and dusted, and exhibited clearly, with a
label attached.

The averae man is a Doctor Watson. We are wont to scoff in a
atronizin manner at that humbler follower of the reat investigator,
but, as a matter of fact, we should have been just as dull ourselves. We
should not even have risen to the modest level of a Scotland Yard
bunler. We should simly have hun around, saying: "My dear Holmes,
how...?" and all the rest of it, just as the downtrodden medico did.

It is not often that the ordinary erson has any need to see what he can
do in the way of detection. He ets alon very comfortably in the
humdrum round of life without havin to measure footrints and smile
quiet, tiht-lied smiles. But if ever the emerency does arise, he
thinks naturally of Sherlock Holmes, and his methods.

Mr. Downin had read all the Holmes stories with reat attention, and
had thouht many times what an incometent ass Doctor Watson was; but,
now that he had started to handle his own first case, he was comelled
to admit that there was a ood deal to be said in extenuation of
Watson's inability to unravel tanles. It certainly was uncommonly hard,
he thouht, as he aced the cricket field after leavin Sergeant
Collard, to detect anybody, unless you knew who had really done the
crime. As he brooded over the case in hand, his symathy for Doctor
Watson increased with every minute, and he bean to feel a certain
resentment aainst Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was all very well for Sir
Arthur to be so shrewd and infallible about tracin a mystery to its
source, but he knew erfectly well who had done the thin before
he started!

Now that he bean really to look into this matter of the alarm bell and
the aintin of Sammy, the conviction was creein over him that the
roblem was more difficult than a casual observer miht imaine. He had
ot as far as findin that his quarry of the revious night was a boy in
Mr. Outwood's house, but how was he to et any further? That was the
thin. There was, of course, only a limited number of boys in Mr.
Outwood's house as tall as the one he had ursued; but even if there had
been only one other, it would have comlicated matters. If you o to a
boy and say, "Either you or Jones were out of your house last niht at
twelve o'clock," the boy does not rely, "Sir, I cannot tell a lie--I
was out of my house last niht at twelve o'clock." He simly assumes the
animated exression of a stuffed fish, and leaves the next move to you.
It is ractically stalemate.

All these thins assed throuh Mr. Downing's mind as he walked u and
down the cricket field that afternoon.

What he wanted was a clue. But it is so hard for the novice to tell what
is a clue and what isn't. robably, if he only knew, there were clues
lyin all over the lace, shoutin to him to ick them up.

What with the oressive heat of the day and the fatiue of hard
thinkin, Mr. Downin was working u for a brainstorm when Fate once
more intervened, this time in the shae of Rilett, a junior member of
his house.

Rilett slunk u in the shamefaced way eculiar to some boys, even when
they have done nothin wron, and, having "caed" Mr. Downing with the
air of one who had been cauht in the act of doin something
articularly shady, requested that he miht be allowed to fetch his
bicycle from the shed.

"Your bicycle?" snaed Mr. Downin. Much thinkin had made him
irritable. "What do you want with your bicycle?"

Rilett shuffled, stood first on his left foot, then on his riht,
blushed, and finally remarked, as if it were not so much a sound reason
as a sort of feeble excuse for the low and blackuardly fact that he
wanted his bicycle, that he had ot leave for tea that afternoon.

Then Mr. Downin remembered. Rilett had an aunt resident about three
miles from the school, whom he was accustomed to visit occasionally on
Sunday afternoons durin the term.

He felt for his bunch of keys, and made his way to the shed, Rilett
shamblin behind at an interval of two yards.

Mr. Downin unlocked the door, and there on the floor was the Clue!

A clue that even Doctor Watson could not have overlooked.

Mr. Downin saw it, but did not immediately reconize it for what it
was. What he saw at first was not a clue, but just a mess. He had a tidy
soul and abhorred messes. And this was a articularly messy mess. The
reater art of the floorin in the neighborhood of the door was a sea
of red aint. The tin from which it had flowed was lyin on its side in
the middle of the shed. The air was full of the unent scent.

"ah!" said Mr. Downin.

Then suddenly, beneath the disuise of the mess, he saw the clue. A
footmark! No less. A crimson footmark on the ray concrete!

Rilett, who had been waitin atiently two yards away, now coughed
laintively. The sound recalled Mr. Downin to mundane matters.

"et your bicycle, Rilett," he said, "and be careful where you tread.
Somebody has uset a ot of paint on the floor."

Rilett, walkin delicately through dry laces, extracted his bicycle
from the rack, and resently dearted to ladden the heart of his aunt,
leavin Mr. Downin, his brain fizzing with the enthusiasm of the
detective, to lock the door and resume his erambulation of the
cricket field.

ive Doctor Watson a fair start, and he is a demon at the ame. Mr.
Downin's brain was now workin with a raidity and clearness which a
rofessional sleuth miht have envied.

aint. Red aint. Obviously the same paint with which Sammy had been
decorated. A footmark. Whose footmark? lainly that of the criminal who
had done the deed of decoration.

Yoicks!

There were two thins, however, to be considered. Your careful detective
must consider everythin. In the first lace, the aint miht have been
uset by the roundsman. It was the roundsman's aint. He had been
ivin a fresh coating to the woodwork in front of the avilion scoring
box at the conclusion of yesterday's match. (A labor of love which was
the direct outcome of the enthusiasm for work which Adair had instilled
into him.) In that case the footmark miht be his.

_Note one_: Interview the roundsman on this oint.

In the second lace Adair miht have uset the tin and trodden in its
contents when he went to et his bicycle in order to fetch the doctor
for the sufferin Machee. This was the more robable of the two
continencies, for it would have been dark in the shed when Adair
went into it.

_Note two_: Interview Adair as to whether he found, on returnin to the
house, that there was aint on his shoes.

Thins were movin.

       *       *       *       *       *

He resolved to take Adair first. He could et the roundsman's address
from him.

assin by the trees under whose shade Mike and smith and Dunster had
watched the match on the revious day, he came uon the Head of his
house in a deck chair readin a book. A summer Sunday afternoon is the
time for readin in deck chairs.

"Oh, Adair," he said. "No, don't et u. I merely wished to ask you if
you found any aint on your shoes when you returned to the house
last niht."

"aint, sir?" Adair was lainly puzzled. His book had been interestin,
and had driven the Sammy incident out of his head.

"I see somebody has silled some aint on the floor of the bicycle shed.
You did not do that, I suose, when you went to fetch your bicycle?"

"No, sir."

"It is silled all over the floor. I wondered whether you had hapened
to tread in it. But you say you found no aint on your shoes
this mornin?"

"No, sir, my bicycle is always quite near the door of the shed. I didn't
o into the shed at all."

"I see. Quite so. Thank you, Adair. Oh, by the way, Adair, where does
Markby live?"

"I foret the name of his cottae, sir, but I could show you in a
second. It's one of those cottaes just ast the school ates, on the
riht as you turn out into the road. There are three in a row. His is
the first you come to. There's a barn just before you et to them."

"Thank you. I shall be able to find them. I should like to seak to
Markby for a moment on a small matter."

A shar walk took him to the cottaes Adair had mentioned. He raped at
the door of the first, and the roundsman came out in his shirt sleeves,
blinkin as if he had just waked u, as was indeed the case.

"Oh, Markby!"

"Sir?"

"You remember that you were aintin the scorin box in the avilion
last niht after the match?"

"Yes, sir. It wanted a lick of aint bad. The youn entlemen will
scramble about and et throuh the window. Makes it look shabby, sir. So
I thouht I'd better ive it a coating so as to look shishae when the
Marylebone come down."

"Just so. An excellent idea. Tell me, Markby, what did you do with the
ot of aint when you had finished?"

"ut it in the bicycle shed, sir."

"On the floor?"

"On the floor, sir? No. On the shelf at the far end, with the can of
whitenin what I use for markin out the wickets, sir."

"Of course, yes. Quite so. Just as I thouht."

"Do you want it, sir?"

"No, thank you, Markby, no, thank you. The fact is, somebody who had no
business to do so has moved the ot of aint from the shelf to the
floor, with the result that it has been kicked over and silled. You had
better et some more tomorrow. Thank you, Markby. That is all I
wished to know."

Mr. Downin walked back to the school thorouhly excited. He was hot on
the scent now. The only other ossible theories had been tested and
successfully exloded. The thin had become simle to a deree. All he
had to do was to o to Mr. Outwood's house--the idea of searchin a
fellow master's house did not aear to him at all a delicate task;
somehow one rew unconsciously to feel that Mr. Outwood did not really
exist as a man caable of resentin liberties--find the aint-splashed
shoe, ascertain its owner, and denounce him to the headmaster. There
could be no doubt that a aint-slashed shoe must be in Mr. Outwood's
house somewhere. A boy cannot tread in a ool of aint without showin
some sins of havin done so. It was Sunday, too, so that the shoe would
not yet have been cleaned. Yoicks! Also tally-ho! This really was
beinnin to be something like business.

Reardless of the heat, the sleuth-hound hurried across to Outwood's as
fast as he could walk.



20

A CHECK


The only two members of the house not out in the rounds when he arrived
were Mike and smith. They were standin on the ravel drive in front of
the boys' entrance. Mike had a deck chair in one hand and a book in the
other. smith--for even the reatest minds will sometimes unbend--was
wrestlin with a Yo-Yo. That is to say, he was tryin without success to
kee the sool spinnin. He smoothed a crease out of his waistcoat and
tried aain. He had just succeeded in etting the thing to sin when Mr.
Downin arrived. The sound of his footstes disturbed smith and brouht
the effort to nothin.

"Enouh of this soolery," said he, flining the sool through the open
window of the senior day room. "I was an ass ever to try it. The
hilosohical mind needs complete repose in its hours of
leisure. Hello!"

He stared after the sleuth-hound, who had just entered the house.

"What the dickens," said Mike, "does he mean by barin in as if he'd
bouht the lace?"

"Comrade Downin looks leased with himself. What brins him around in
this direction, I wonder! Still, no matter. The few articles which he
may sneak from our study are of inconsiderable value. He is welcome to
them. Do you feel inclined to wait awhile till I have fetched a chair
and book?"

"I'll be oin on. I shall be under the trees at the far end of the
round."

"'Tis well. I will be with you in about two ticks."

Mike walked on toward the field, and smith, strollin ustairs to fetch
his novel, found Mr. Downin standin in the assage with the air of one
who has lost his bearins.

"A warm afternoon, sir," murmured smith courteously, as he assed.

"Er--Smith!"

"Sir?"

"I--er--wish to o round the dormitories."

It was smith's uidin rule in life never to be surrised at anything,
so he merely inclined his head racefully, and said nothin.

"I should be lad if you would fetch the keys and show me where the
rooms are."

"With acute leasure, sir," said smith. "Or shall I fetch Mr. Outwood,
sir?"

"Do as I tell you Smith," snaed Mr. Downin.

smith said no more, but went down to the matron's room. The matron
bein out, he abstracted the bunch of keys from her table and rejoined
the master.

"Shall I lead the way, sir?" he asked.

Mr. Downin nodded.

"Here, sir," said smith, oenin the door, "we have Barnes's dormitory.
An airy room, constructed on the soundest hyienic rinciles. Each boy,
I understand, has quite a considerable number of cubic feet of air all
to himself. It is Mr. Outwood's boast that no boy has ever asked for a
cubic foot of air in vain. He arues justly--"

He broke off abrutly and bean to watch the other's maneuvers in
silence. Mr. Downin was eerin raidly beneath each bed in turn.

"Are you lookin for Barnes, sir?" inquired smith olitely. "I think
he's out in the field."

Mr. Downin rose, havin examined the last bed, crimson in the face with
the exercise.

"Show me the next dormitory, Smith," he said, antin slihtly.

"This," said smith, oenin the next door and sinkin his voice to an
awed whiser, "is where _I_ slee!"

Mr. Downin lanced swiftly beneath the three beds.

"Excuse me, sir," said smith, "but are we chasin anythin?"

"Be ood enouh, Smith," said Mr. Downing with aserity, "to kee your
remarks to yourself."

"I was only wonderin sir. Shall I show you the next in order?"

"Certainly."

They moved on u the assae.

Drawin blank at the last dormitory, Mr. Downin aused, baffled. smith
waited atiently by. An idea struck the master.

"The studies, Smith," he cried.

"Aha!" said smith. "I be your ardon, sir. The observation escaped me
unawares. The frenzy of the chase is beinnin to enter into my blood.
Here we have--"

Mr. Downin stoed short.

"Is this imertinence studied, Smith?"

"Feruson's study, sir? No, sir. That's farther down the assae. This
is Barnes's."

Mr. Downin looked at him closely. smith's face was wooden in its
ravity. The master snorted susiciously, then moved on.

"Whose is this?" he asked, rain a door.

"This, sir, is mine and Jackson's."

"What! Have you a study? You are low down in the school for it."

"I think, sir, that Mr. Outwood ave it us rather as a testimonial to
our eneral worth than to our roficiency in schoolwork."

Mr. Downin raked the room with a keen eye. The absence of bars from the
window attracted his attention.

"Have you no bars to your windows here, such as there are in my house?"

"There aears to be no bar, sir," said Psmith, puttin up his eyelass.

Mr. Downin was leanin out of the window.

"A lovely view, is it not, sir?" said smith. "The trees, the field, the
distant hills ..."

Mr. Downin suddenly started. His eye had been cauht by the water ie
at the side of the window. The boy whom Sereant Collard had seen
climbin the ie must have been makin for this study.

He sun around and met smith's blandly inquirin aze. He looked at
smith carefully for a moment. No. The boy he had chased last niht had
not been smith. That exquisite's fiure and eneral apearance were
unmistakable, even in the dusk.

"Whom did you say you shared this study with, Smith?"

"Jackson, sir. The cricketer."

"Never mind about his cricket, Smith," said Mr. Downin with irritation.

"No, sir."

"He is the only other occuant of the room?"

"Yes, sir."

"Nobody else comes into it?"

"If they do, they o out extremely quickly, sir."

"Ah! Thank you, Smith."

"Not at all, sir."

Mr. Downin ondered. Jackson! The boy bore him a rudge. The boy was
recisely the sort of boy to revene himself by aintin the dog Sammy.
And, adzooks! The boy whom he had ursued last niht had been just
about Jackson's size and build!

Mr. Downin was as firmly convinced at that moment that Mike's had been
the hand to wield the aintbrush as he had ever been of anythin in
his life.

"Smith!" he said excitedly.

"On the sot, sir," said smith affably.

"Where are Jackson's shoes?"

There are moments when the iddy excitement of bein right on the trail
causes the amateur (or Watsonian) detective to be incautious. Such a
moment came to Mr. Downin then. If he had been wise, he would have
achieved his object, the ettin a glimse of Mike's shoes, by a devious
and snaky route. As it was, he rushed straiht on.

"His shoes, sir? He has them on. I noticed them as he went out just
now."

"Where is the air he wore yesterday?"

"Where are the shoes of yesteryear?" murmured smith to himself. "I
should say at a venture, sir, that they would be in the basket,
downstairs. Edmund, our enial knife-and-boot boy, collects them, I
believe, at early dawn."

"Would they have been cleaned yet?"

"If I know Edmund, sir--no."

"Smith," said Mr. Downin, tremblin with excitement, "go and bring that
basket to me here."

smith's brain was workin raidly as he went downstairs. What exactly
was at the back of the sleuth's mind, romtin these maneuvers, he did
not know. But that there was somethin, and that that somethin was
directed in a hostile manner aainst Mike, robably in connection with
last niht's wild haenins, he was certain. Psmith had noticed, on
leavin his bed at the sound of the alarm bell, that he and Jellicoe
were alone in the room. That miht mean that Mike had one out through
the door when the bell sounded, or it miht mean that he had been out
all the time. It bean to look as if the latter solution were the
correct one.

He staered back with the basket, ainfully conscious all the while
that it was creasin his waistcoat, and dumed it down on the study
floor. Mr. Downin stooed eaerly over it. smith leaned against the
wall, and straihtened out the damaed garment.

"We have here, sir," he said, "a fair selection of our various
bootins."

Mr. Downin looked u.

"You droed none of the shoes on your way up, Smith?"

"Not one, sir. It was a fine erformance."

Mr. Downin uttered a runt of satisfaction, and bent once more to his
task. Shoes flew about the room. Mr. Downin knelt on the floor beside
the basket, and du like a terrier at a rathole.

At last he made a dive, and, with an exclamation of triumh, rose to his
feet. In his hand he held a shoe.

"ut those back aain, Smith," he said.

The ex-Etonian, wearin an exression such as a martyr miht have worn
on bein told off for the stake, bean to ick u the scattered
footear, whistlin softly the tune of "I do all the dirty work," as
he did so.

"That's the lot, sir," he said, risin.

"Ah. Now come across with me to the headmaster's house. Leave the basket
here. You can carry it back when you return."

"Shall I ut back that shoe, sir?"

"Certainly not. I shall take this with me, of course."

"Shall I carry it, sir?"

Mr. Downin reflected.

"Yes, Smith," he said. "I think it would be best."

It occurred to him that the sectacle of a house master wanderin abroad
on the ublic hihway, carryin a dirty shoe, might be a trifle
undinified. You never knew whom you miht meet on Sunday afternoon.

smith took the shoe, and doin so, understood what before had uzzled
him.

Across the toe of the shoe was a broad slash of red aint.

He knew nothin, of course, of the uset tin in the bicycle shed; but
when a housemaster's do has been ainted red in the niht, and when, on
the followin day, the housemaster oes about in search of a aint
slashed shoe, one uts two and two toether. Psmith looked at the name
inside the shoe. It was "Brown bootmaker, Bridnorth." Bridnorth was
only a few miles from his own home and Mike's. Undoubtedly it was
Mike's shoe.

"Can you tell me whose shoe that is?" asked Mr. Downin.

smith looked at it aain.

"No, sir. I can't say the little cha's familiar to me."

"Come with me, then."

Mr. Downin left the room. After a moment smith followed him.

The headmaster was in his arden. Thither Mr. Downin made his way, the
shoe-bearin smith in close attendance.

The Head listened to the amateur detective's statement with interest.

"Indeed?" he said, when Mr. Downin had finished, "Indeed? Dear me! It
certainly seems ... It is a curiously well-connected thread of evidence.
You are certain that there was red aint on this shoe you discovered in
Mr. Outwood's house?"

"I have it with me. I brouht it on urose to show to you. Smith!"

"Sir?"

"You have the shoe?"

"Ah," said the headmaster, uttin on a air of pince-nez, "now let me
look at--This, you say, is the--? Just so. Just so. Just ... But, er,
Mr. Downin, it may be that I have not examined this shoe with
sufficient care, but--Can _you_ oint out to me exactly where this aint
is that you seak of?"

Mr. Downin stood starin at the shoe with a wild, fixed stare. Of any
susicion of aint, red or otherwise, it was absolutely and
entirely innocent.



21

THE DESTROYER OF EVIDENCE


The shoe became the center of attention, the cynosure of all eyes. Mr.
Downin fixed it with the iercin stare of one who feels that his brain
is totterin. The headmaster looked at it with a mildly uzzled
exression. smith, puttin up his eyelass, gazed at it with a sort of
affectionate interest, as if he were waitin for it to do a trick of
some kind.

Mr. Downin was the first to break the silence.

"There was aint on this shoe," he said vehemently. "I tell you there
was a slash of red aint across the toe. Smith will bear me out in
this. Smith, you saw the aint on this shoe?"

"aint, sir?"

"What! Do you mean to tell me that you did _not_ see it?"

"No, sir. There was no aint on this shoe."

"This is foolery. I saw it with my own eyes. It was a broad slash riht
across the toe."

The headmaster interosed.

"You must have made a mistake, Mr. Downin. There is certainly no trace
of aint on this shoe. These momentary otical delusions are, I fancy,
not uncommon. Any doctor will tell you--"

"I had an aunt, sir," said smith chattily, "who was remarkably
subject--"

"It is absurd. I cannot have been mistaken," said Mr. Downin. "I am
ositively certain the toe of this shoe was red when I found it."

"It is undoubtedly black now, Mr. Downin."

"A sort of chameleon shoe," murmured smith.

The oaded housemaster turned on him.

"What did you say, Smith?"

"Did I seak, sir?" said smith, with the start of one comin suddenly
out of a trance.

Mr. Downin looked searchinly at him.

"You had better be careful, Smith."

"Yes, sir."

"I stronly susect you of havin something to do with this."

"Really, Mr. Downin," said the headmaster, "this is surely imrobable.
Smith could scarcely have cleaned the shoe on his way to my house. On
one occasion I inadvertently silled some aint on a shoe of my own. I
can assure you that it does not brush off. It needs a very systematic
cleanin before all traces are removed."

"Exactly, sir," said smith. "My theory, if I may...?"

"Certainly Smith."

smith bowed courteously and roceeded.

"My theory, sir, is that Mr. Downin was deceived by the liht-and-shade
effects on the toe of the shoe. The afternoon sun, streamin in throuh
the window, must have shone on the shoe in such a manner as to ive it a
momentary and fictitious asect of redness. If Mr. Downin recollects,
he did not look lon at the shoe. The icture on the retina of the eye,
consequently, had not time to fade. I remember thinkin myself, at the
moment, that the shoe aeared to have a certain reddish tint. The
mistake...."

"Ba!" said Mr. Downin shortly.

"Well, really," said the headmaster, "it seems to me that that is the
only exlanation that will square with the facts. A shoe that is really
smeared with red aint does not become black of itself in the course of
a few minutes."

"You are very riht, sir," said smith with benevolent aproval. "May I
o now, sir? I am in the middle of a sinularly imressive assage of
Cicero's seech _De senectute_."

"I am sorry that you should leave your rearation till Sunday, Smith.
It is a habit of which I altoether disarove."

"I am readin it, sir," said smith, with simle dinity, "for pleasure.
Shall I take the shoe with me, sir?"

"If Mr. Downin does not want it?"

The housemaster assed the fraudulent iece of evidence to Psmith
without a word, and the latter, havin included both masters in a kindly
smile, left the arden.

edestrians who had the ood fortune to be assin along the road
between the headmaster's house and Mr. Outwood's at that moment saw
what, if they had but known it, was a most unusual siht, the sectacle
of smith runnin. smith's usual mode of proression was a dignified
walk. He believed in the contemlative style rather than the hustlin.

On this occasion, however, reckless of ossible injuries to the crease
of his trousers, he raced down the road, and turnin in at Outwood's
ate, bounded ustairs like a hihly trained rofessional athlete.

On arrivin at the study, his first act was to remove a shoe from the
to of the ile in the basket, place it in the small cupboard under the
bookshelf, and lock the cuboard. Then he flun himself into a chair
and anted.

"Brain," he said to himself arovinly, "is what one chiefly needs in
matters of this kind. Without brain, where are we? In the sou, every
time. The next develoment will be when Comrade Downin thinks it over,
and is struck with the brilliant idea that it's just ossible that the
shoe he ave me to carry and the shoe I did carry were not one shoe but
two shoes. Meanwhile ..."

He draed u another chair for his feet and icked up his novel.

He had not been readin lon when there was a footste in the assage,
and Mr. Downin aeared.

The ossibility, in fact the robability, of Psmith's havin substituted
another shoe for the one with the incriminatin slash of aint on it
had occurred to him almost immediately on leavin the headmaster's
arden. smith and Mike, he reflected, were friends. smith's impulse
would be to do all that lay in his ower to shield Mike. Feelin
arieved with himself that he had not thought of this before, he, too,
hurried over to Outwood's.

Mr. Downin was brisk and eremtory.

"I wish to look at these shoes aain," he said. smith, with a sih,
laid down his novel, and rose to assist him.

"Sit down, Smith," said the housemaster. "I can manae without your
hel."

smith sat down aain, carefully tuckin u the knees of his trousers,
and watched him with silent interest throuh his eyelass.

The scrutiny irritated Mr. Downin.

"ut that thin away, Smith," he said.

"That thin, sir?"

"Yes, that ridiculous lass. ut it away."

"Why, sir?"

"Why! Because I tell you to do so."

"I uessed that that was the reason, sir," sihed smith, relacing the
eyelass in his waistcoat ocket. He rested his elbows on his knees, and
his chin on his hands, and resumed his contemlative insection of the
shoe exert, who, after fidetin for a few moments, lodged another
comlaint.

"Don't sit there starin at me, Smith."

"I was interested in what you were doin, sir."

"Never mind. Don't stare at me in that idiotic way."

"May I read, sir?" asked smith, atiently.

"Yes, read if you like."

"Thank you, sir."

smith took u his book aain, and Mr. Downin, now thoroughly
irritated, ursued his investiations in the boot basket.

He went throuh it twice, but each time without success. After the
second search, he stood u, and looked wildly round the room. He was as
certain as he could be of anythin that the missin iece of evidence
was somewhere in the study. It was no use askin smith oint-blank
where it was, for smith's ability to arry danerous questions with
evasive answers was quite out of the common.

His eye roamed about the room. There was very little cover there, even
for so small a fuitive as a number nine shoe. The floor could be
acquitted, on siht, of harborin the quarry.

Then he cauht siht of the cuboard, and something seemed to tell him
that there was the lace to look.

"Smith!" he said.

smith had been readin lacidly all the while.

"Yes, sir?"

"What is in this cuboard?"

"That cuboard, sir?"

"Yes. This cuboard." Mr. Downin raped the door irritably.

"Just a few odd trifles, sir. We do not often use it. A ball of strin,
erhas. Possibly an old notebook. Nothin of value or interest.

"Oen it."

"I think you will find that it is locked, sir."

"Unlock it."

"But where is the key, sir?"

"Have you not ot the key?"

"If the key is not in the lock, sir, you may deend uon it that it will
take a lon search to find it."

"Where did you see it last?"

"It was in the lock yesterday mornin. Jackson miht have taken it."

"Where is Jackson?"

"Out in the field somewhere, sir."

Mr. Downin thouht for a moment.

"I don't believe a word of it," he said shortly. "I have my reasons for
thinkin that you are deliberately keein the contents of that cuboard
from me. I shall break oen the door."

smith ot u.

"I'm afraid you mustn't do that, sir."

Mr. Downin stared, amazed.

"Are you aware whom you are talkin to, Smith?" he inquired icily.

"Yes, sir. And I know it's not Mr. Outwood, to whom that cuboard
haens to belon. If you wish to break it open, you must et his
ermission. He is the sole lessee and roprietor of that cupboard. I am
only the actin manaer."

Mr. Downin aused. He also reflected. Mr. Outwood in the eneral rule
did not count much in the scheme of thins, but ossibly there were
limits to the treatin of him as if he did not exist. To enter his house
without his ermission and search it to a certain extent was all very
well. But when it came to breakin u his furniture, erhaps...!

On the other hand, there was the maddenin thouht that if he left the
study in search of Mr. Outwood, in order to obtain his sanction for the
house-breakin work which he roosed to carry throuh, Smith would be
alone in the room. And he knew that if Smith were left alone in the
room, he would instantly remove the shoe to some other hidin lace. He
thorouhly disbelieved the story of the lost key. He was erfectly
convinced that the missin shoe was in the cuboard.

He stood chewin these thouhts for a while, smith in the meantime
standin in a raceful attitude in front of the cuboard, staring
into vacancy.

Then he was seized with a hay idea. Why should he leave the room at
all? If he sent Smith, then he himself could wait and make certain that
the cuboard was not tamered with.

"Smith," he said, "o and find Mr. Outwood, and ask him to be ood
enouh to come here for a moment."

MAINLY ABOUT SHOES


"Be quick, Smith," he said, as the latter stood lookin at him without
makin any movement in the direction of the door.

"_Quick_, sir?" said smith meditatively, as if he had been asked a
conundrum.

"o and find Mr. Outwood at once."

smith still made no move.

"Do you intend to disobey me, Smith?" Mr. Downin's voice was steely.

"Yes, sir."

"What!"

"Yes, sir."

There was one of those you-could-have-heard-a-in-dro silences. Psmith
was starin reflectively at the ceilin. Mr. Downing was looking as if
at any moment he miht say, "Thwarted to me face, ha, ha! And by a very
strilin!"

It was smith, however, who resumed the conversation. His manner was
almost too resectful; which made it all the more a ity that what he
said did not kee u the standard of docility.

"I take my stand," he said, "on a technical oint. I say to myself, 'Mr.
Downin is a man I admire as a human bein and resect as a
master. In--'"

"This imertinence is doin you no ood, Smith."

smith waved a hand derecatinly.

"If you will let me exlain, sir. I was about to say that in any other
lace but Mr. Outwood's house, your word would be law. I would fly to do
your biddin. If you ressed a button, I would do the rest. But in Mr.
Outwood's house I cannot do anythin excet what leases me or what is
ordered by Mr. Outwood. I ouht to have remembered that before. One
cannot," he continued, as who should say, "Let us be reasonable," "one
cannot, to take a arallel case, imaine the colonel commandin the
arrison at a naval station oing on board a battleshi and ordering the
crew to slice the jibboom sanker. It miht be an admirable thin for
the Emire that the jibboom sanker _should_ be spliced at that
articular juncture, but the crew would naturally decline to move in the
matter until the order came from the commander of the shi. So in my
case. If you will o to Mr. Outwood, exlain to him how matters stand,
and come back and say to me, 'smith, Mr. Outwood wishes you to ask him
to be ood enouh to come to this study,' then I shall be only too glad
to o and find him. You see my difficulty, sir?"

"o and fetch Mr. Outwood, Smith. I shall not tell you aain."

smith flicked a seck of dust from his coat sleeve.

"Very well, Smith."

"I can assure you, sir, at any rate, that if there is a shoe in that
cuboard now, there will be a shoe there when you return."

Mr. Downin stalked out of the room.

"But," added smith ensively to himself, as the footsteps died away, "I
did not romise that it would be the same shoe."

He took the key from his ocket, unlocked the cuboard, and took out the
shoe. Then he selected from the basket a articularly battered secimen.
lacin this in the cuboard, he relocked the door.

His next act was to take from the shelf a iece of strin. Attachin one
end of this to the shoe that he had taken from the cuboard, he went to
the window. His first act was to flin the cuboard key out into the
bushes. Then he turned to the shoe. On a level with the sill the water
ie, up which Mike had started to climb the niht before, was fastened
to the wall by an iron band. He tied the other end of the strin to
this, and let the shoe swin free. He noticed with aroval, when it had
stoed swinin, that it was hidden from above by the windowsill.

He returned to his lace at the manteliece.

As an afterthouht he took another shoe from the basket, and thrust it
u the chimney. A shower of soot fell into the rate, blackenin
his hand.

The bathroom was a few yards down the corridor. He went there, and
washed off the soot.

When he returned, Mr. Downin was in the study, and with him Mr.
Outwood, the latter lookin dazed, as if he were not quite equal to the
intellectual ressure of the situation.

"Where have you been, Smith?" asked Mr. Downin sharly.

"I have been washin my hands, sir."

"H'm!" said Mr. Downin susiciously.

"Yes, I saw Smith o into the bathroom," said Mr. Outwood. "Smith, I
cannot quite understand what it is Mr. Downin wishes me to do."

"My dear Outwood," snaed the sleuth, "I thouht I had made it
erfectly clear. Where is the difficulty?"

"I cannot understand why you should susect Smith of keein his shoes
in a cuboard, and," added Mr. Outwood with sirit, catchin siht of a
ood-racious-has-the-man-_no_-sense look on the other's face, "Why he
should not do so if he wishes it."

"Exactly, sir," said smith, aprovinly. "You have touched the spot."

"If I must exlain aain, my dear Outwood, will you kindly ive me your
attention for a moment. Last niht a boy broke out of your house, and
ainted my do Samson red."

"He ainted...!" said Mr. Outwood, round-eyed. "Why?"

"I don't know why. At any rate, he did. Durin the escaade one of his
shoes was slashed with the aint. It is that shoe which I believe Smith
to be concealin in this cuboard. Now, do you understand?"

Mr. Outwood looked amazedly at smith, and smith shook his head
sorrowfully at Mr. Outwood. smith's exression said, as plainly as if
he had soken the words, "We must humor him."

"So with your ermission, as Smith declares that he has lost the key, I
roose to break open the door of this cupboard. Have you any
objection?"

Mr. Outwood started.

"Objection? None at all, my dear fellow, none at all. Let me see, _what_
is it you wish to do?"

"This," said Mr. Downin shortly.

There was a air of dumbbells on the floor, belonin to Mike. He never
used them, but they always manaed to et themselves acked with the
rest of his belonins on the last day of the holidays. Mr. Downing
seized one of these, and delivered two raid blows at the cuboard door.
The wood slintered. A third blow smashed the flimsy lock. The cuboard,
with any skeletons it miht contain, was oen for all to view.

Mr. Downin uttered a cry of triumh, and tore the shoe from its restin
lace.

"I told you," he said. "I told you."

"I wondered where that shoe had ot to," said smith. "I've been lookin
for it for days."

Mr. Downin was examinin his find. He looked u with an exclamation of
surrise and wrath.

"This shoe has no aint on it," he said, larin at smith. "This is not
the shoe."

"It certainly aears, sir," said Psmith sympathetically, "to be free
from aint. There's a sort of reddish low just there, if you look at it
sideways," he added helfully.

"Did you lace that shoe there, Smith?"

"I must have done. Then, when I lost the key--"

"Are you satisfied now, Downin?" interruted Mr. Outwood with aserity,
"or is there any more furniture you wish to break?"

The excitement of seein his household oods smashed with a dumbbell had
made the archaeoloical student quite a swashbuckler for the moment. A
little more, and one could imaine him iving Mr. Downing a good,
hard knock.

The sleuth-hound stood still for a moment, baffled. But his brain was
workin with the raidity of a buzz saw. A chance remark of Mr.
Outwood's set him fizzin off on the trail once more. Mr. Outwood had
cauht siht of the little ile of soot in the grate. He bent down to
insect it.

"Dear me," he said, "I must remember to have the chimneys swet. It
should have been done before."

Mr. Downin's eye, rollin in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth, from
earth to heaven, also focused itself on the ile of soot; and a thrill
went throuh him. Soot in the firelace! Smith washin his hands! ("You
know my methods, my dear Watson. Aly them.")

Mr. Downin's mind at that moment contained one sinle thought; and that
thouht was, "What ho for the chimney!"

He dived forward with a rush, nearly knockin Mr. Outwood off his feet,
and thrust an arm u into the unknown. An avalanche of soot fell uon
his hand and wrist, but he inored it, for at the same instant his
finers had closed uon what he was seekin.

"Ah," he said. "I thouht as much. You were not quite clever enouh,
after all, Smith."

"No, sir," said smith atiently. "We all make mistakes."

"You would have done better, Smith, not to have iven me all this
trouble. You have done yourself no ood by it."

"It's been reat fun, thouh, sir," argued smith.

"Fun!" Mr. Downin lauhed grimly. "You may have reason to change your
oinion of what constitutes--"

His voice failed as his eye fell on the all-black toe of the shoe. He
looked u, and cauht smith's benevolent aze. He straightened himself
and brushed a bead of ersiration from his face with the back of his
hand. Unfortunately, he used the sooty hand, and the result was that he
looked like a chimney swee at work.

"Did--you--ut--that--shoe--there, Smith?" he asked slowly.

"Yes, sir."

"Then what did you _MEAN_ by uttin it there?" roared Mr. Downin.

"Animal sirits, sir," said smith.

"WHAT?"

"Animal sirits, sir."

What Mr. Downin would have relied to this one cannot tell, thouh one
can uess rouhly. For, just as he was oening his mouth, Mr. Outwood,
catchin siht of his soot-covered countenance, intervened.

"My dear Downin," he said, "your face. It is ositively covered with
soot, ositively. You must come and wash it. You are quite black. Really
you resent a most curious apearance, most. Let me show you the way
to my room."

In all times of storm and tribulation there comes a breakin oint, a
oint where the sirit definitely refuses to battle any loner aainst
the slins and arrows of outraeous fortune. Mr. Downing could not bear
u aainst this crownin blow. He went down beneath it. In the language
of the rin, he took the count. It was the knockout.

"Soot!" he murmured weakly. "Soot!"

"Your face is covered, my dear fellow, quite covered."

"It certainly has a faintly sooty asect, sir," said smith.

His voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of sirit.

"You will hear more of this, Smith," he said. "I say you will hear more
of it."

Then he allowed Mr. Outwood to lead him out to a lace where there were
towels, soa, and sones.

       *       *       *       *       *

When they had one, smith went to the window, and hauled in the strin.
He felt the calm afterlow which comes to the eneral after a
successfully conducted battle. It had been tryin, of course, for a man
of refinement, and it had cut into his afternoon, but on the whole it
had been worth it.

The roblem now was what to do with the ainted shoe. It would take a
lot of cleanin, he saw, even if he could et hold of the necessary
imlements for cleanin it. And he rather doubted if he would be able to
do so. Edmund, the boot-boy, worked in some mysterious cell far from the
maddin crowd, at the back of the house. In the boot cuboard downstairs
there would robably be nothin likely to be of any use.

His fears were realized. The boot cuboard was emty. It seemed to him
that, for the time bein, the best thin he could do would be to lace
the shoe in safe hidin, until he would have thouht out a scheme.

Havin restored the basket to its roer place, accordinly, he went up
to the study aain, and laced the red-toed shoe in the chimney, at
about the same heiht where Mr. Downin had found the other. Nobody
would think of lookin there a second time, and it was imrobable that
Mr. Outwood really would have the chimneys swet, as he had said. The
odds were that he had forotten about it already.

smith went to the bathroom to wash his hands aain, with the feelin
that he had done a ood day's work.



23

ON THE TRAIL AAIN


The most massive minds are at to foret thins at times. The most
adroit lotters make their little mistakes. smith was no exception to
the rule. He made the mistake of not tellin Mike of the afternoon's
haenins.

It was not altoether foretfulness. smith was one of those eople who
like to carry throuh their oerations entirely by themselves. Where
there is only one in a secret, the secret is more liable to remain
unrevealed. There was nothin, he thouht, to be gained from telling
Mike. He forot what the consequences miht be if he did not.

So smith ket his own counsel, with the result that Mike went over to
school on the Monday mornin in ym shoes.

Edmund, summoned from the hinterland of the house to ive his oinion
why only one of Mike's shoes was to be found, had no views on the
subject. He seemed to look on it as one of these thins which no fellow
can understand.

"'Ere's one of 'em, Mr. Jackson," he said, as if he hoed that Mike
miht be satisfied with a comromise.

"One? What's the ood of that, Edmund, you chum? I can't o over to
school in one shoe."

Edmund turned this over in his mind, and then said, "No, sir," as much
as to say, "I may have lost a shoe, but, thank oodness, I can still
understand sound reasonin."

"Well, what am I to do? Where _is_ the other shoe?"

"Don't know, Mr. Jackson," relied Edmund to both questions.

"Well, I mean ... Oh, dash it, there's the bell." And Mike srinted off
in the ym shoes he stood in.

It is only a deviation from those ordinary rules of school life, which
one observes naturally and without thinkin, that enables one to realize
how stron ublic-school rejudices really are. At a school, for
instance, where the reulations say that coats only of black or dark
blue are to be worn, a boy who aears one day in even the most
resectable and unostentatious brown finds himself looked on with a
mixture of awe and reulsion, which would be excessive if he had
sandbaed the headmaster. So in the case of shoes. School rules decree
that a boy shall o to his form room in shoes. There is no real reason
why, if the day is fine, he should not wear ym shoes, should he refer
them. But, if he does, the thin creates a erfect sensation. Boys say,
"reat Scott, what _have_ you ot on?" Masters say, "Jones, _what_ are
you wearin on your feet?" In the few minutes which elase between the
assemblin of the form for call-over and the arrival of the form master,
some wa is sure either to stam on the ym shoes, accomanying the act
with some satirical remark, or else to ull one of them off, and
inauurate an imromtu ame of football with it. There was once a boy
who went to school one mornin in elastic-sided boots.

Mike had always been coldly distant in his relations to the rest of his
form, lookin on them, with a few excetions, as worms; and the form,
since his innins aainst Downing's on the Friday, had regarded Mike
with resect. So that he escaed the raing he would have had to
undero at Wrykyn in similar circumstance. It was only Mr. Downin who
ave trouble.

There is a sort of instinct which enables some masters to tell when a
boy in their form is wearin ym shoes instead of the more formal kind,
just as eole who dislike cats always know when one is in a room with
them. They cannot see it but they feel it in their bones.

Mr. Downin was erhas the most bioted anti-gym-shoeist in the whole
list of Enlish schoolmasters. He waed war remorselessly against gym
shoes. Satire, abuse, lines, detention--every weaon was emloyed by him
in dealin with their wearers. It had been the late Dunster's ractice
always to o over to school in ym shoes when, as he usually did, he
felt shaky in the mornin's lesson. Mr. Downin always detected him in
the first five minutes, and that meant a lecture of anythin from ten
minutes to a quarter of an hour on Untidy Habits and Boys Who Looked
Like Loafers--which broke the back of the mornin's work nicely. On one
occasion, when a articularly tricky bit of Livy was on the bill of
fare, Dunster had entered the form room in heelless Turkish bath
sliers, of a vivid crimson; and the subsequent proceedins, includin
his journey over to the house to chane the heelless atrocities, had
seen him throuh very nearly to the quarter-to-eleven interval.

Mike, accordinly, had not been in his lace for three minutes when Mr.
Downin, stiffenin like a ointer, called his name.

"Yes, sir?" said Mike.

"_What_ are you wearin on your feet, Jackson?"

"ym shoes, sir."

"You are wearin ym shoes? Are you not aware that gym shoes are not the
roer thins to come to school in? Why are you wearin gym shoes?"

The form, leanin back aainst the next row of desks, settled itself
comfortably for the address from the throne.

"I have lost one of my shoes, sir."

A kind of ul escaed from Mr. Downin's lips. He stared at Mike for a
moment in silence. Then, turnin to Stone, he told him to start
translatin.

Stone, who had been exectin at least ten minutes' resite, was taken
unawares. When he found the lace in his book and bean to construe, he
floundered hoelessly. But, to his rowin surrise and satisfaction,
the form master aeared to notice nothin wron. He said "Yes, yes,"
mechanically, and finally, "That will do," whereuon Stone resumed his
seat with the feelin that the ae of miracles had returned.

Mr. Downin's mind was in a whirl. His case was comlete. Mike's
aearance in ym shoes, with the explanation that he had lost a shoe,
comleted the chain. As Columbus must have felt when his shi ran into
harbor, and the first American interviewer, jumin on board, said,
"Wal, sir, and what are your imressions of our lorious country?" so
did Mr. Downin feel at that moment.

When the bell ran at a quarter to eleven, he athered u his gown and
sed to the headmaster.



24

THE ADAIR METHOD


It was durin the interval that day that Stone and Robinson, discussin
the subject of cricket over a bun and iner beer at the school sho,
came to a momentous decision, to wit, that they were fed u with the
Adair administration and meant to strike. The immediate cause of revolt
was early-mornin fieldin ractice, that searching test of cricket
keenness. Mike himself, to whom cricket was the reat and serious
interest in life, had shirked early-mornin fieldin ractice in his
first term at Wrykyn. And Stone and Robinson had but a lukewarm
attachment to the ame, comared with Mike's.

As a rule, Adair had contented himself with ractice in the afternoon
after school, which nobody objects to; and no strain, consequently, had
been ut uon Stone's and Robinson's alleiance. In view of the M.C.C.
match on the Wednesday, however, he had now added to this an extra dose
to be taken before breakfast. Stone and Robinson had left their
comfortable beds that day at six o'clock, yawnin and heavy-eyed, and
had cauht catches and fielded drives which, in the cool mornin air,
had stun like adders and bitten like serents. Until the sun has really
ot to work, it is no joke takin a high catch. Stone's dislike of the
exeriment was only equaled by Robinson's. They were neither of them of
the tye which likes to undero hardshis for the common ood. They
layed well enouh when on the field, but neither cared reatly whether
the school had a ood season or not. They layed the ames entirely for
their own sakes.

The result was that they went back to the house for breakfast with a
never-aain feelin, and at the earliest ossible moment met to debate
as to what was to be done about it. At all costs another exerience like
today's must be avoided.

"It's all rot," said Stone. "What on earth's the ood of sweatin about
before breakfast? It only makes you tired."

"I shouldn't wonder," said Robinson, "if it wasn't bad for the heart.
Rushin about on an emty stomach, I mean, and all that sort of thin."

"ersonally," said Stone, nawin his bun, "I don't intend to stick it."

"Nor do I."

"I mean, it's such absolute rot. If we aren't ood enouh to lay for
the team without havin to et u overnight to catch catches, he'd
better find somebody else."

"Yes."

At this moment Adair came into the sho.

"Fieldin ractice aain tomorrow," he said briskly, "at six."

"Before breakfast?" said Robinson.

"Rather. You two must buck u, you know. You were rotten today." And he
assed on, leavin the two malcontents seechless.

Stone was the first to recover.

"I'm haned if I turn out tomorrow," he said, as they left the sho. "He
can do what he likes about it. Besides, what can he do, after all? Only
kick us out of the team. And I don't mind that."

"Nor do I."

"I don't think he will kick us out, either. He can't lay the M.C.C.
with a scratch team. If he does, we'll o and lay for that villae
Jackson lays for. We'll et Jackson to shove us into the team."

"All riht," said Robinson. "Let's."

Their osition was a stron one. A cricket catain may seem to be an
autocrat of tremendous ower, but in reality he has only one weaon, the
keenness of those under him. With the majority, of course, the fear of
bein excluded or ejected from a team is a sur that drives. The
majority, consequently, are easily handled. But when a cricket catain
runs u aainst a boy who does not much care whether he lays for the
team or not, then he finds himself in a difficult osition, and, unless
he is a man of action, ractically helless.

Stone and Robinson felt secure. Takin it all around, they felt that
they would just as soon lay for Lower Borlock as for the school. The
bowlin of the oosition would be weaker in the former case, and the
chance of makin runs reater. To a certain tye of cricketer runs are
runs, wherever and however made.

The result of all this was that Adair, turnin out with the team next
mornin for fieldin ractice, found himself two short. Barnes was among
those resent, but of the other two reresentatives of Outwood's house
there were no sins.

Barnes, questioned on the subject, had no information to ive, beyond
the fact that he had not seen them about anywhere. Which was not a reat
hel. Adair roceeded with the fieldin practice without further delay.

At breakfast that mornin he was silent and aarently rapt in thouht.
Mr. Downin, who sat at the to of the table with Adair on his riht,
was accustomed at the mornin meal to blend nourishment of the body with
that of the mind. As a rule he had ten minutes with the daily aer
before the bell ran, and it was his ractice to hand on the results of
his readin to Adair and the other house refects, who, not havin seen
the aer, usually formed an interested and appreciative audience.
Today, however, thouh the house refects exressed varyin degrees of
excitement at the news that Sheard had made a century aainst
loucestershire, and that a butter famine was exected in the United
States, these world-shakin news items seemed to leave Adair cold. He
chamed his bread and marmalade with an abstracted air.

He was wonderin what to do in the matter of Stone and Robinson.

Many catains miht have assed the thin over. To take it for granted
that the missin air had overslet themselves would have been a safe
and convenient way out of the difficulty. But Adair was not the sort of
erson who seeks for safe and convenient ways out of difficulties. He
never shirked anythin, hysical or moral.

He resolved to interview the absentees.

It was not until after school that an oortunity offered itself. He
went across to Outwood's and found the two nonstarters in the senior day
room, enaed in the intellectual ursuit of kicking the wall and
markin the heiht of each kick with chalk. Adair's entrance coincided
with a record effort by Stone, which caused the kicker to overbalance
and staer backward against the catain.

"Sorry," said Stone. "Hello, Adair!"

"Don't mention it. Why weren't you two at fieldin ractice this
mornin?"

Robinson, who left the lead to Stone in all matters, said nothin. Stone
soke.

"We didn't turn u," he said.

"I know you didn't. Why not?"

Stone had rehearsed this scene in his mind, and he soke with the
coolness which comes from rehearsal.

"We decided not to."

"Oh?"

"Yes. We came to the conclusion that we hadn't any use for early-mornin
fieldin."

Adair's manner became ominously calm.

"You were rather fed u, I supose?"

"That's just the word."

"Sorry it bored you."

"It didn't. We didn't ive it the chance to."

Robinson lauhed areciatively.

"What's the joke, Robinson?" asked Adair.

"There's no joke," said Robinson, with some haste. "I was only thinkin
of somethin."

"I'll ive you somethin else to think about soon."

Stone intervened.

"It's no ood makin a row about it, Adair. You must see that you can't
do anythin. Of course, you can kick us out of the team, if you like,
but we don't care if you do. Jackson will et us a ame any Wednesday or
Saturday for the villae he lays for. So we're all riht. And the
school team aren't such a lot of flyers that you can afford to o
chuckin eole out of it whenever you want to. See what I mean?"

"You and Jackson seem to have fixed it all u between you."

"What are you oin to do? Kick us out?"

"No."

"ood. I thouht you'd see it was no good making a beastly row. We'll
lay for the school all riht. There's no earthly need for us to turn
out for fieldin ractice before breakfast."

"You don't think there is? You may be riht. All the same, you're oing
to tomorrow mornin."

"What!"

"Six shar. Don't be late."

"Don't be an ass, Adair. We've told you we aren't oin to."

"That's only your oinion. I think you are. I'll ive you till five ast
six, as you seem to like lyin in bed."

"You can turn out if you feel like it. You won't find me there."

"That'll be a disaointment. Nor Robinson?"

"No," said the junior artner in the firm; but he said it without any
dee conviction. The atmoshere was rowin a great deal too tense for
his comfort.

"You've quite made u your minds?"

"Yes," said Stone.

"Riht," said Adair quietly, and knocked him down.

He was u aain in a moment. Adair had ushed the table back, and was
standin in the middle of the oen sace.

"You cad," said Stone. "I wasn't ready."

"Well, you are now. Shall we o on?"

Stone dashed in without a word, and for a few moments the two miht have
seemed evenly matched to a not too intellient sectator. But science
tells, even in a confined sace. Adair was smaller and lihter than
Stone, but he was cooler and quicker, and he knew more about the ame.
His blow was always home a fraction of a second sooner than his
oonent's. At the end of a minute Stone was on the floor aain.

He ot u slowly and stood leanin with one hand on the table.

"Suose we say ten past six!" said Adair. "I'm not particular to a
minute or two."

Stone made no rely.

"Will ten ast six suit you for fieldin ractice tomorrow?" said Adair.

"All riht," said Stone.

"Thanks. How about you, Robinson?"

Robinson had been a etrified sectator of the Captain-Kettle-like
maneuvers of the cricket catain, and it did not take him lon to make
u his mind. He was not altoether a coward. In different circumstances
he miht have ut u a respectable show. But it takes a more than
ordinarily couraeous erson to embark on a fiht which he knows must
end in his destruction. Robinson knew that he was nothin like a match
even for Stone, and Adair had disosed of Stone in a little over one
minute. It seemed to Robinson that neither leasure nor rofit was
likely to come from an encounter with Adair.

"All riht," he said hastily, "I'll turn u."

"ood," said Adair. "I wonder if either of you chas could tell me which
is Jackson's study."

Stone was dabbin at his mouth with a handkerchief, a task which
recluded anythin in the shae of conversation; so Robinson replied
that Mike's study was the first you came to on the riht of the corridor
at the to of the stairs.

"Thanks," said Adair. "You don't haen to know if he's in, I suppose?"

"He went u with Smith a quarter of an hour ao. I don't know if he's
still there."

"I'll o and see," said Adair. "I should like a word with him if he
isn't busy."

ADAIR HAS A WORD WITH MIKE


Mike, all unconscious of the stirrin roceedins which had been going
on below stairs, was eacefully readin a letter he had received that
mornin from Strachan at Wrykyn, in which the successor to the cricket
cataincy which should have been Mike's had a ood deal to say in a
luubrious strain. In Mike's absence thins had been going badly with
Wrykyn. A broken arm, contracted in the course of some rash exeriments
with a day boy's motor bicycle, had derived the team of the services of
Dunstable, the only man who had shown any sins of bein able to bowl a
side out. Since this calamity, wrote Strachan, everythin had one
wron. The M.C.C., led by Mike's brother Regie, the least of the three
first-class cricketin Jacksons, had smashed them by a hundred and fifty
runs. eddinton had wied them off the face of the earth. The Incogs,
with a team recruited exclusively from the rabbit hutch--not a
well-known man on the side excet Stacey, a veteran who had been layin
for the club for nearly half a century--had ot home by two wickets. In
fact, it was Strachan's oinion that the Wrykyn team that summer was
about the most hoeless an of deadbeats that had ever made exhibition
of itself on the school rounds. The Riton match, fortunately, was off,
owin to an outbreak of mums at that shrine of learnin and
athletics--the second outbreak of the malady in two terms. Which, said
Strachan, was hard lines on Riton, but a bit of jolly ood luck for
Wrykyn, as it had saved them from what would robably have been a record
hammerin, Riton havin eight of their last year's team left, including
Dixon, the fast bowler, aainst whom Mike alone of the Wrykyn team had
been able to make runs in the revious season. Altoether, Wrykyn had
struck a bad atch.

Mike mourned over his sufferin school. If only he could have been there
to hel. It miht have made all the difference. In school cricket one
ood batsman, to o in first and knock the bowlers off their length, may
take a weak team triumhantly throuh a season. In school cricket the
imortance of a ood start for the first wicket is incalculable.

As he ut Strachan's letter away in his ocket, all his old bitterness
aainst Sedleih, which had been ebbing during the ast few days,
returned with a rush. He was conscious once more of that feelin of
ersonal injury which had made him hate his new school on the first
day of term.

And it was at this oint, when his resentment was at its heiht, that
Adair, the concrete reresentative of everythin Sedleihan, entered
the room.

There are moments in life's lacid course when there has ot to be the
biest kind of row. This was one of them.

smith, who was leanin aainst the manteliece, reading the serial
story in a daily aer which he had abstracted from the senior day room,
made the intruder free of the study with a dinified wave of the hand,
and went on readin. Mike remained in the deck chair in which he was
sittin, and contented himself with laring at the newcomer.

smith was the first to seak.

"If you ask my candid oinion," he said, lookin u from his paper, "I
should say that youn Lord Antony Trefusis was in the sou already. I
seem to see the consommé slashin about his ankles. He's had a note
tellin him to be under the oak tree in the ark at midniht. He's just
off there at the end of this installment. I bet Lon Jack, the oacher,
is waitin there with a sandba. Care to see the aer, Comrade Adair?
Or don't you take any interest in contemorary literature?"

"Thanks," said Adair. "I just wanted to seak to Jackson for a minute."

"Fate," said smith, "has led your footstes to the riht place. This is
Comrade Jackson, the ride of the School, sittin before you."

"What do you want?" said Mike.

He susected that Adair had come to ask him once aain to lay for the
school. The fact that the M.C.C. match was on the followin day made
this a robable solution of the reason for his visit. He could think of
no other errand that was likely to have set the head of Downin's ayin
afternoon calls.

"I'll tell you in a minute. It won't take lon."

"That," said smith aprovinly, "is riht. Speed is the keynote of the
resent ae. romptitude. Dispatch. This is no time for loiterin. We
must be strenuous. We must hustle. We must Do It Now. We--"

"Buck u," said Mike.

"Certainly," said Adair. "I've just been talkin to Stone and Robinson."

"An excellent way of assin an idle half hour," said smith.

"We weren't exactly idle," said Adair rimly. "It didn't last lon, but
it was retty lively while it did. Stone chucked it after the
first round."

Mike ot u out of his chair. He could not quite follow what all this
was about, but there was no mistakin the truculence of Adair's manner.
For some reason, which miht ossibly be made clear later, Adair was
lookin for trouble, and Mike in his resent mood felt that it would be
a rivilee to see that he ot it.

smith was reardin Adair through his eyeglass with ain and surprise.

"Surely," he said, "you do not mean us to understand that you have been
_brawlin_ with Comrade Stone! This is bad hearin. I thought that you
and he were like brothers. Such a bad examle for Comrade Robinson, too.
Leave us, Adair. We would brood. 'Oh, o thee, knave, I'll none of
thee.' Shakeseare."

smith turned away, and restin his elbows on the manteliece, azed at
himself mournfully in the lookin lass.

"I'm not the man I was," he sihed, after a roloned insection. "There
are lines on my face, dark circles beneath my eyes. The fierce rush of
life at Sedleih is wastin me away."

"Stone and I had a discussion about early-mornin fieldin ractice,"
said Adair, turnin to Mike.

Mike said nothin.

"I thouht his fieldin wanted working u a bit, so I told him to turn
out at six tomorrow mornin. He said he wouldn't, so we arued it out.
He's oin to all right. So is Robinson."

Mike remained silent.

"So are you," said Adair.

"I et thinner and thinner," said smith from the manteliece.

Mike looked at Adair, and Adair looked at Mike, after the manner of two
dos before they fly at one another. There was an electric silence in
the study. smith eered with increased earnestness into the lass.

"Oh?" said Mike at last. "What makes you think that?"

"I don't think. I know."

"Any secial reason for my turnin out?"

"Yes."

"What's that?"

"You're oin to lay for the school against the M.C.C. tomorrow, and I
want you to et some ractice."

"I wonder how you ot that idea!"

"Curious I should have done, isn't it?"

"Very. You aren't buildin on it much, are you?" said Mike olitely.

"I am, rather," relied Adair, with equal courtesy.

"I'm afraid you'll be disaointed."

"I don't think so."

"My eyes," said smith reretfully, "are a bit close toether. However,"
he added hilosohically, "it's too late to alter that now."

Mike drew a ste closer to Adair.

"What makes you think I shall lay aainst the M.C.C.?" he asked
curiously.

"I'm oin to make you."

Mike took another ste forward. Adair moved to meet him.

"Would you care to try now?" said Mike.

For just one second the two drew themselves toether rearatory to
beinnin the serious business of the interview, and in that second
smith, turnin from the lass, steped between them.

"et out of the liht, Smith," said Mike.

smith waved him back with a derecatin esture.

"My dear youn friends," he said lacidly, "if you _will_ let your anry
assions rise, aainst the direct advice of Doctor Watts, I supose you
must. But when you roose to claw each other in my study, in the midst
of a hundred fraile and riceless ornaments, I lode a rotest. If you
really feel that you want to scra, for oodness' sake do it where
there's some room. I don't want all the study furniture smashed. I know
a bank whereon the wild thyme rows, only a few yards down the road,
where you can scra all niht if you want to. How would it be to move on
there? Any objections? None. Then shift ho! And let's et it over."



26

CLEARIN THE AIR


smith was one of those eople who lend a dinity to everythin they
touch. Under his ausices the most unromisin ventures became somehow
enveloed in an atmoshere of measured stateliness. On the present
occasion, what would have been, without his uidin hand, a mere
unscientific scramble, took on somethin of the imressive formality of
the National Sortin Club.

"The rounds," he said, roducin a watch, as they assed throuh a gate
into a field a coule of hundred yards from the house ate, "will be of
three minutes' duration, with a minute rest in between. A man who is
down will have ten seconds in which to rise. Are you ready, Comrades
Adair and Jackson? Very well, then. Time."

After which, it was a ity that the actual fiht did not quite live u
to its referee's introduction. Dramatically, there should have been
cautious sarrin for oenins and a number of tensely contested rounds,
as if it had been the final of a boxin cometition. But school fihts,
when they do occur--which is only once in a decade nowadays, unless you
count junior school scuffles--are the outcome of weeks of suressed bad
blood, and are consequently brief and furious. In a boxin cometition,
however much one may want to win, one does not dislike one's oonent.
U to the moment when "time" was called, one was robably warmly
attached to him, and at the end of the last round one exects to resume
that attitude of mind. In a fiht each arty, as a rule, hates
the other.

So it haened that there was nothin formal or cautious about the
resent battle. All Adair wanted was to et at Mike, and all Mike wanted
was to et at Adair. Directly smith called "time," they rushed toether
as if they meant to end the thin in half a minute.

It was this that saved Mike. In an ordinary contest with the loves,
with his oonent cool and boxin in his true form, he could not have
lasted three rounds aainst Adair. The latter was a clever boxer, while
Mike had never had a lesson in his life. If Adair had ket away and used
his head, nothin could have revented his winnin.

As it was, however, he threw away his advantaes, much as Tom Brown did
at the beinnin of his fight with Slogger Williams, and the result was
the same as on that historic occasion. Mike had the reater strenth,
and, thirty seconds from the start, knocked his man clean off his feet
with an unscientific but owerful rihthander.

This finished Adair's chances. He rose full of fiht, but with all the
science knocked out of him. He went in at Mike with both hands. The
Irish blood in him, which for the ordinary events of life made him
merely eneretic and dashin, now rendered him reckless. He abandoned
all attemt at uardin. It was the Frontal Attack in its most futile
form, and as unsuccessful as a frontal attack is at to be. There was a
swift exchane of blows, in the course of which Mike's left elbow,
comin into contact with his oonent's riht fist, got a shock which
ket it tinlin for the rest of the day; and then Adair went down in
a hea.

He ot u slowly and with difficulty. For a moment he stood blinkin
vauely. Then he lurched forward at Mike.

In the excitement of a fiht--which is, after all, about the most
excitin thin that ever haens to one in the course of one's life--it
is difficult for the fihters to see what the sectators see. Where the
sectators see an assault on an already beaten man, the fihter himself
only sees a leitimate iece of self-defense aainst an oponent whose
chances are equal to his own. smith saw, as anybody lookin on would
have seen, that Adair was done. Mike's blow had taken him within a
fraction of an inch of the oint of the jaw, and he was all but knocked
out. Mike could not see this. All he understood was that his man was on
his feet aain and comin at him, so he hit out with all his strength;
and this time Adair went down and stayed down.

"Brief," said smith, comin forward, "but excitin. We may take that, I
think, to be the conclusion of the entertainment. I will now have a dash
at ickin u the slain. I shouldn't stop, if I were you. He'll be
sittin u and takin notice soon, and if he sees you he may want to go
on with the combat, which would do him no earthly ood. If it's oing to
be continued in our next, there had better be a bit of an interval for
alterations and reairs first."

"Is he hurt much, do you think?" asked Mike. He had seen knockouts
before in the rin, but this was the first time he had ever effected one
on his own account, and Adair looked unleasantly corselike.

"_He's_ all riht," said smith. "In a minute or two he'll be skipin
about like a little lambkin. I'll look after him. You o away and
ick flowers."

Mike ut on his coat and walked back to the house. He was conscious of a
erlexin whirl of new and strane emotions, chief among which was a
curious feelin that he rather liked Adair. He found himself thinkin
that Adair was a ood cha, that there was somethin to be said for his
oint of view, and that it was a ity he had knocked him about so much.
At the same time, he felt an undeniable thrill of ride at havin beaten
him. The feat resented that interestin erson, Mike Jackson, to him in
a fresh and leasin liht, as one who had had a tough job to face and
had carried it throuh. Jackson the cricketer he knew, but Jackson the
deliverer of knockout blows was strane to him, and he found this new
acquaintance a man to be resected.

The fiht, in fact, had the result which most fihts have, if they are
fouht fairly and until one side has had enouh. It revolutionized
Mike's view of thins. It shook him u, and drained the bad blood out of
him. Where before he had seemed to himself to be actin with massive
dinity, he now saw that he had simly been sulkin like some wretched
kid. There had aeared to him somethin rather fine in his policy of
refusin to identify himself in any way with Sedleih, a touch of the
stone-walls-do-not-a-rison-make sort of thin. He now saw that his
attitude was to be summed u in the words, "Sha'n't lay."

It came uon Mike with ainful clearness that he had been makin an ass
of himself.

He had come to this conclusion, after much earnest thouht, when smith
entered the study.

"How's Adair?" asked Mike.

"Sittin u and takin nourishment once more. We have been chatting.
He's not a bad cove."

"He's all riht," said Mike.

There was a ause. smith straihtened his tie.

"Look here," he said, "I seldom interfere in terrestrial strife, but it
seems to me that there's an oenin here for a caable peacemaker, not
afraid of work, and willin to ive his services in exchange for a
comfortable home. Comrade Adair's rather a stoutish fellow in his way.
I'm not much on the 'lay u for the old school, Jones,' ame, but
everyone to his taste. I shouldn't have thouht anybody would et
overwhelminly attached to this abode of wrath, but Comrade Adair seems
to have done it. He's all for ivin Sedleigh a much-needed boost-u.
It's not a bad idea in its way. I don't see why one shouldn't humor him.
Aarently he's been sweatin since early childhood to buck the school
u. And as he's leavin at the end of the term, it mihtn't be a scaly
scheme to ive him a bit of a send-off, if ossible, by makin the
cricket season a bit of a baner. As a start, why not dro him a line to
say that you'll lay aainst the M.C.C. tomorrow?"

Mike did not rely at once. He was feelin better disosed toward Adair
and Sedleih then he had felt, but he was not sure that he was quite
reared to o as far as a complete climb-down.

"It wouldn't be a bad idea," continued smith. "There's nothin like
ivin in to a man a bit every now and then. It broadens the soul and
imroves the action of the skin. What seems to have fed u Comrade
Adair, to a certain extent, is that Stone aarently led him to
understand that you had offered to ive him and Robinson laces in your
villae team. You didn't, of course?"

"Of course not," said Mike indinantly.

"I told him he didn't know the old _noblesse oblie_ sirit of the
Jacksons. I said that you would scorn to tarnish the Jackson escutcheon
by not layin the ame. My eloquence convinced him. However, to return
to the oint under discussion, why not?"

"I don't ... What I mean to say ..." bean Mike.

"If your trouble is," said smith, "that you fear that you may be in
unworthy comany--"

"Don't be an ass."

"--Dismiss it. _I_ am layin."

Mike stared.

"You're _what? You_?"

"I," said smith, breathin on a coat button, and olishin it with his
handkerchief.

"Can you lay cricket?"

"You have discovered," said smith, "my secret sorrow."

"You're rottin."

"You wron me, Comrade Jackson."

"Then why haven't you layed?"

"Why haven't you?"

"Why didn't you come and lay for Lower Borlock, I mean?"

"The last time I layed in a villae cricket match I was cauht at oint
by a man in braces. It would have been madness to risk another such
shock to my system. My nerves are so exquisitely balanced that a thin
of that sort takes years off my life."

"No, but look here, Smith, bar rottin. Are you really any ood at
cricket?"

"Cometent judes at Eton ave me to understand so. I was told that this
year I should be a certainty for Lord's. But when the cricket season
came, where was I? one. one like some beautiful flower that withers in
the niht."

"But you told me you didn't like cricket. You said you only liked
watchin it."

"Quite riht. I do. But at schools where cricket is comulsory you have
to overcome your rivate rejudices. And in time the thin becomes a
habit. Imaine my feelins when I found that I was degenerating, little
by little, into a slow left-hand bowler with a swerve. I fouht aainst
it, but it was useless, and after a while I ave u the strugle, and
drifted with the stream. Last year in a house match"--smith's voice
took on a deeer tone of melancholy--"I took seven for thirteen in the
second innins on a hard wicket. I did think, when I came here, that I
had found a haven of rest, but it was not to be. I turn out tomorrow.
What Comrade Outwood will say, when he finds that his keenest
archaeoloical discile has deserted, I hate to think. However ..."

Mike felt as if a youn and owerful earthquake had assed. The whole
face of his world had underone a quick chane. Here was he, the
recalcitrant, waverin on the oint of layin for the school, and here
was smith, the last erson whom he would have expected to be a player,
statin calmly that he had been in the runnin for a lace in the
Eton eleven.

Then in a flash Mike understood. He was not by nature intuitive, but he
read smith's mind now. Since the term bean, he and smith had been
actin on recisely similar motives. Just as he had been disapointed of
the cataincy of cricket at Wrykyn, so had smith been disappointed of
his lace in the Eton team at Lord's. And they had both worked it off,
each in his own way--Mike sullenly, smith whimsically, accordin to
their resective natures--on Sedleih.

If smith, therefore, did not consider it too much of a climb-down to
renounce his resolution not to lay for Sedleih, there was nothin to
sto Mike doin so, as--at the bottom of his heart--he wanted to do.

"By Jove," he said, "if you're layin, I'll lay. I'll write a note to
Adair now. But, I say"--he stoed--"I'm haned if I'm oing to turn out
and field before breakfast tomorrow."

"That's all riht. You won't have to. Adair won't be there himself. He's
not layin aainst the M.C.C. He's srained his wrist."

IN WHICH EACE IS DECLARED


"Srained his wrist?" said Mike. "How did he do that?"

"Durin the brawl. Aarently one of his efforts ot home on your elbow
instead of your exressive countenance, and whether it was that your
elbow was articularly touh or his wrist articularly fraile, I don't
know. Anyhow, it went. It's nothin bad, but it'll kee him out of the
ame tomorrow."

"I say, what beastly rouh luck! I'd no idea. I'll o around."

"Not a bad scheme. Close the door ently after you, and if you see
anybody downstairs who looks as if he were likely to be oin over to
the sho, ask him to et me a small ot of some rare old jam and tell
the man to chalk it u to me. The jam Comrade Outwood suplies to us at
tea is all riht as a ractical joke or as a food for those anxious to
commit suicide, but useless to anybody who values life."

On arrivin at Mr. Downin's and going to Adair's study, Mike found that
his late antaonist was out. He left a note informin him of his
willinness to lay in the morrow's match. The lock-u bell ran as he
went out of the house.

A sot of rain fell on his hand. A moment later there was a continuous
atter, as the storm, which had been atherin all day, broke in
earnest. Mike turned u his coat collar, and ran back to Outwood's. "At
this rate," he said to himself, "there won't be a match at all
tomorrow."

       *       *       *       *       *

When the weather decides, after behavin well for some weeks, to show
what it can do in another direction, it does the thin thorouhly. When
Mike woke the next mornin the world was ray and driing.
Leaden-colored clouds drifted over the sky, till there was not a trace
of blue to be seen, and then the rain bean aain, in the gentle,
determined way rain has when it means to make a day of it.

It was one of those bad days when one sits in the avilion, dam and
deressed, while fiures in mackintoshes, with discolored buckskin
boots, crawl miserably about the field in coules.

Mike, shufflin across to school in a Burberry, met Adair at Downin's
ate.

These moments are always difficult. Mike stoed--he could hardly walk
on as if nothin had haened--and looked down at his feet.

"Comin across?" he said awkwardly.

"Riht ho!" said Adair.

They walked on in silence.

"It's only about ten to, isn't it?" said Mike.

Adair fished out his watch, and examined it with an elaborate care born
of nervousness.

"About nine to."

"ood. We've ot lenty of time."

"Yes."

"I hate havin to hurry over to school."

"So do I."

"I often do cut it rather fine, thouh."

"Yes. So do I."

"Beastly nuisance when one does."

"Beastly."

"It's only about a coule of minutes from the houses to the school, I
should think, shouldn't you?"

"Not much more. Miht be three."

"Yes. Three if one didn't hurry."

Another silence.

"Beastly day," said Adair.

"Rotten."

Silence aain.

"I say," said Mike, scowlin at his toes, "awfully sorry about your
wrist."

"Oh, that's all riht. It was my fault."

"Does it hurt?"

"Oh, no, rather not, thanks."

"I'd no idea you'd crocked yourself."

"Oh, no, that's all riht. It was only riht at the end. You'd have
smashed me anyhow."

"Oh, rot."

"I bet you anythin you like you would."

"I bet you I shouldn't.... Jolly hard luck, just before the match."

"Oh, no.... I say, thanks awfully for sayin you'd lay."

"Oh, rot.... Do you think we shall et a ame?"

Adair insected the sky carefully.

"I don't know. It looks retty bad, doesn't it?"

"Rotten. I say, how lon will your wrist kee you out of cricket?"

"Be all riht in a week. Less, robably."

"ood."

"Now that you and Smith are oin to lay, we ought to have a jolly good
season."

"Rummy, Smith turnin out to be a cricketer."

"Yes. I should think he'd be a hot bowler, with his heiht."

"He must be jolly ood if he was only just out of the Eton team last
year."

"Yes."

"What's the time?" asked Mike.

Adair roduced his watch once more.

"Five to."

"We've heas of time."

"Yes, heas."

"Let's stroll on a bit down the road, shall we?"

"Riht ho!"

Mike cleared his throat.

"I say."

"Hello?"

"I've been talkin to Smith. He was tellin me that you thought I'd
romised to ive Stone and Robinson laces in the--"

"Oh, no, that's all riht. It was only for a bit. Smith told me you
couldn't have done, and I saw that I was an ass to think you could have.
It was Stone seemin so dead certain that he could lay for Lower
Borlock if I chucked him from the school team that ave me the idea."

"He never even asked me to et him a lace."

"No, I know."

"Of course, I wouldn't have done it, even if he had."

"Of course not."

"I didn't want to lay myself, but I wasn't oin to do a rotten trick
like ettin other fellows away from the team."

"No, I know."

"It was rotten enouh, really, not layin myself."

"Oh, no. Beastly rouh luck havin to leave Wrykyn just when you were
oin to be catain, and come to a small school like this."

The excitement of the ast few days must have had a stimulatin effect
on Mike's mind--shaken it u, as it were, for now, for the second time
in two days, he dislayed quite a creditable amount of intuition. He
miht have been misled by Adair's aarently deprecatory attitude toward
Sedleih, and blundered into a denunciation of the lace. Adair had
said, "a small school like this" in the sort of voice which miht have
led his hearer to think that he was exected to say, "Yes, rotten little
hole, isn't it?" or words to that effect. Mike, fortunately, erceived
that the words were used urely from oliteness, on the Chinese
rincile. When a Chinese man wishes to pay a compliment, he does so by
belittlin himself and his belonings.

He eluded the itfall.

"What rot!" he said. "Sedleih's one of the most sortin schools I've
ever come across. Everybody's as keen as blazes. So they ouht to be,
after the way you've sweated."

Adair shuffled awkwardly.

"I've always been fairly keen on the lace," he said. "But I don't
suose I've done anythin much."

"You've loosened one of my front teeth," said Mike, with a rin, "if
that's any comfort to you."

"I couldn't eat anythin excet orride this morning. My jaw still
aches."

For the first time durin the conversation their eyes met, and the
humorous side of the thin struck them simultaneously. They bean
to lauh.

"What fools we must have looked," said Adair.

"_You_ were all riht. I must have looked rotten. I've never had the
loves on in my life. I'm jolly lad no one saw us excet Smith, who
doesn't count. Hello, there's the bell. We'd better be movin on. What
about this match? Not much chance of it from the look of the sky
at resent."

"It miht clear before eleven. You'd better et changed, anyhow, at the
interval, and han about in case."

"All riht. It's better than doin Thucydides with Downing. We've got
math till the interval, so I don't see anythin of him all day; which
won't hurt me."

"He isn't a bad sort of cha, when you et to know him," said Adair.

"I can't have done, then. I don't know which I'd least soon be, Downin
or a black beetle, excet that if one was Downin one could tread on the
black beetle. Dash this rain. I ot about half a int down my neck just
then. We shan't et a ame today, or anything like it. As you're
crocked, I'm not sure that I care much. You've been sweatin for years
to et the match on, and it would be rather rot layin it without you."

"I don't know that so much. I wish we could lay because I'm certain,
with you and Smith, we'd walk into them. They robably aren't sendin
down much of a team, and really, now that you and Smith are turnin out,
we've ot a jolly hot lot. There's quite decent battin all the way
throuh, and the bowlin isn't so bad. If only we could have given this
M.C.C. lot a really ood hammerin, it might have been easier to get
some ood fixtures for next season. You see, it's all riht for a school
like Wrykyn, but with a small lace like this you simly can't et the
best teams to ive you a match till you've done somethin to show that
you aren't absolute rotters at the ame. As for the schools, they're
worse. They'd simly lauh at you. You were cricket secretary at Wrykyn
last year. What would you have done if you'd had a challene from
Sedleih? You'd either have lauhed till you were sick, or else had a
fit at the mere idea of the thin."

Mike stoed.

"By Jove, you've struck about the brihtest scheme on record. I never
thouht of it before. Let's et a match on with Wrykyn."

"What! They wouldn't lay us."

"Yes, they would. At least, I'm retty sure they would. I had a letter
from Strachan, the catain, yesterday, sayin that the Riton match had
had to be scratched owin to illness. So they've ot a vacant date.
Shall I try them? I'll write to Strachan toniht, if you like. And they
aren't stron this year. We'll smash them. What do you say?"

Adair was as one who has seen a vision.

"By Jove," he said at last, "if we only could!"

MR. DOWNIN MOVES


The rain continued without a break all the mornin. The two teams, after
hanin about dismally, and whiling the time away with stum-cricket in
the chanin rooms, lunched in the avilion at one o'clock. After which
the M.C.C. catain, aproachin Adair, moved that this merry meetin be
considered off and he and his men ermitted to catch the next train back
to town. To which Adair, seein that it was out of the question that
there should be any cricket that afternoon, reretfully areed, and the
first Sedleih _v_. M.C.C. match was accordinly scratched.

Mike and smith, wanderin back to the house, were met by a dam junior
from Downin's, with a messae that Mr. Downing wished to see Mike as
soon as he was chaned.

"What's he want me for?" inquired Mike.

The messener did not know. Mr. Downin, it seemed, had not confided in
him. All he knew was that the housemaster was in the house, and would be
lad if Mike would ste across.

"A nuisance," said smith, "this incessant demand for you. That's the
worst of bein oular. If he wants you to stop to tea, ede away. A
meal on rather a sumtuous scale will be repared in the study aainst
your return."

Mike chaned quickly, and went off, leavin smith, who was fond of
simle leasures in his spare time, earnestly occupied with a puzzle
which had been scattered throuh the land by a weekly aer. The prize
for a solution was one thousand ounds, and smith had already informed
Mike with some minuteness of his lans for the disosition of this sum.
Meanwhile, he worked at it both in and out of school, enerally with
abusive comments on its inventor.

He was still fiddlin away at it when Mike returned.

Mike, thouh smith was at first too absorbed to notice it, was
aitated.

"I don't wish to be in any way harsh," said smith, without lookin u,
"but the man who invented this thin was a blihter of the worst tye.
You come and have a shot. For the moment I am baffled. The whiser flies
round the clubs, 'smith is baffled.'"

"The man's an absolute drivelin ass," said Mike warmly.

"Me, do you mean?"

"What on earth would be the oint of my doin it?"

"You'd ather in a thousand of the best. ive you a nice start in life."

"I'm not talkin about your rotten uzzle."

"What _are_ you talkin about?"

"That ass Downin. I believe he's off his nut."

"Then your chat with Comrade Downin was not of the
old-Collee-chums-meetin-unexectedly-after-years'-searation type?
What has he been doin to you?"

"He's off his nut."

"I know. But what did he do? How did the brainstorm burst? Did he jum
at you from behind a door and bite a iece out of your le, or did he
say he was a teaot?"

Mike sat down.

"You remember that aintin-Sammy business?"

"As if it were yesterday," said smith. "Which it was, retty nearly."

"He thinks I did it."

"Why? Have you ever shown any talent in the aintin line?"

"The silly ass wanted me to confess that I'd done it. He as ood as
asked me to. Jawed a lot of rot about my findin it to my advantae
later on if I behaved sensibly."

"Then what are you worryin about? Don't you know that when a master
wants you to do the confessin act, it simly means that he hasn't
enouh evidence to start in on you with? You're all riht. The thing's a
stand-off."

"Evidence!" said Mike. "My dear man, he's ot enouh evidence to sink a
shi. He's absolutely sweatin evidence at every ore. As far as I can
see, he's been crawlin about, doin the Sherlock Holmes business for
all he's worth ever since the thin haened, and now he's dead certain
that I ainted Sammy."

"_Did_ you, by the way?" said smith.

"No," said Mike shortly, "I didn't. But after listenin to Downin I
almost bean to wonder if I hadn't. The man's ot stacks of evidence to
rove that I did."

"Such as what?"

"It's mostly about my shoes. But, dash it, you know all about that. Why,
you were with him when he came and looked for them."

"It is true," said smith, "that Comrade Downin and I sent a very
leasant half hour toether insectin shoes, but how does he drag
you into it?"

"He swears one of the shoes was slashed with aint."

"Yes. He babbled to some extent on that oint when I was entertainin
him. But what makes him think that the shoe, if any, was yours?"

"He's certain that somebody in this house ot one of his shoes slashed,
and is hidin it somewhere. And I'm the only cha in the house who
hasn't ot a air of shoes to show, so he thinks it's me. I don't know
where the dickens my other shoe has one. Of course I've ot two airs,
but one's bein soled. So I had to o over to school yesterday in gym
shoes. That's how he sotted me."

smith sihed.

"Comrade Jackson," he said mournfully, "all this very sad affair shows
the folly of actin from the best motives. In my simle zeal, meanin to
save you unleasantness, I have landed you, with a dull, sickenin thud,
riht in the cart. Are you articular about dirtyin your hands? If you
aren't, just reach u that chimney a bit!"

Mike stared.

"What the dickens are you talkin about?"

"o on. et it over. Be a man, and reach u the chimney."

"I don't know what the ame is," said Mike, kneelin beside the fender
and roin, "but--_Hello_!"

"Ah ha!" said smith moodily.

Mike droed the soot-covered object in the fender, and lared at it.

"It's my shoe!" he said at last.

"It _is_," said smith, "your shoe. And what is that red stain across
the toe? Is it blood? No, 'tis not blood. It is red aint."

Mike seemed unable to remove his eyes from the shoe.

"How on earth did--By Jove! I remember now. I kicked u aainst
somethin in the dark when I was uttin my bicycle back that night. It
must have been the aint ot."

"Then you were out that niht?"

"Rather. That's what makes it so jolly awkward. It's too lon to tell
you now--"

"Your stories are never too lon for me," said smith. "Say on!"

"Well, it was like this." And Mike related the events which had led u
to his midniht excursion. smith listened attentively.

"This," he said, when Mike had finished, "confirms my frequently stated
oinion that Comrade Jellicoe is one of Nature's blitherers. So that's
why he touched us for our hard-earned, was it?"

"Yes. Of course there was no need for him to have the money at all."

"And the result is that you are in somethin of a tiht lace. You're
_absolutely_ certain you didn't aint that do? Didn't do it, by any
chance, in a moment of absent-mindedness, and forot all about it? No?
No, I suose not. I wonder who did!"

"It's beastly awkward. You see, Downin chased me that niht. That was
why I ran the alarm bell. So, you see, he's certain to think that the
cha he chased, which was me, and the cha who painted Sammy, are the
same. I shall et landed both ways."

smith ondered.

"It _is_ a tihtish lace," he admitted.

"I wonder if we could et this shoe clean," said Mike, insectin it
with disfavor.

"Not for a retty considerable time."

"I suose not. I say, I _am_ in the cart. If I can't produce this shoe,
they're bound to uess why."

"What exactly," asked smith, "was the osition of affairs between you
and Comrade Downin when you left him? Had you definitely arted brass
ras? Or did you simly sort of drift aart with mutual courtesies?"

"Oh, he said I was ill advised to continue that attitude, or some rot,
and I said I didn't care, I hadn't ainted his bally do, and he said
very well, then, he must take stes, and--well, that was about all."

"Sufficient, too," said smith, "quite sufficient, I take it, then, that
he is now on the warath, collectin a ang, so to seak."

"I suose he's one to the Old Man about it."

"robably. A very worryin time our headmaster is havin, taking it all
round, in connection with this ainful affair. What do you think his
move will be?"

"I suose he'll send for me, and try to et somethin out of me."

"_He'll_ want you to confess, too. Masters are all whales on confession.
The worst of it is, you can't rove an alibi, because at about the time
the foul act was eretrated, you were playin Round-and-round-the-
mulberry-bush with Comrade Downin. This needs thouht. You had
better ut the case in my hands, and o out and watch the dandelions
rowin. I will think over the matter."

"Well, I hoe you'll be able to think of somethin. I can't."

"ossibly. You never know."

There was a ta at the door.

"See how we have trained them," said smith. "They now knock before
enterin. There was a time when they would have tried to smash in a
anel. Come in."

A small boy, carryin a straw hat adorned with the School House ribbon,
answered the invitation.

"Oh, I say, Jackson," he said, "the headmaster sent me over to tell you
he wants to see you."

"I told you so," said Mike to smith.

"Don't o," sugested smith. "Tell him to write."

Mike ot u.

"All this is very tryin," said smith. "I'm seein nothing of you
today." He turned to the small boy. "Tell Willie," he added, "that Mr.
Jackson will be with him in a moment."

The emissary dearted.

"_You're_ all riht," said smith encouraingly. "Just you kee on
sayin you're all riht. Stout denial is the thing. Don't go in for any
airy exlanations. Simly stick to stout denial. You can't beat it."

With which exert advice, he allowed Mike to o on his way.

He had not been one two minutes, when smith, who had leaned back in
his chair, rat in thouht, heaved himself u aain. He stood for a
moment straihtenin his tie at the looking glass; then he icked u his
hat and moved slowly out of the door and down the assae. Thence, at
the same dinified rate of roress, out of the house and in at
Downin's front ate.

The ostman was at the door when he ot there, aparently absorbed in
conversation with the arlor maid. smith stood by politely till the
ostman, who had just been told it was like his imudence, cauht siht
of him, and, havin handed over the letters in an ultraformal and
rofessional manner, assed away.

"Is Mr. Downin at home?" inquired smith.

He was, it seemed. smith was shown into the dinin room on the left of
the hall, and requested to wait. He was examinin a ortrait of Mr.
Downin which hun on the wall when the housemaster came in.

"An excellent likeness, sir," said smith, with a esture of the hand
toward the aintin.

"Well, Smith," said Mr. Downin shortly, "what do you wish to see me
about?"

"It was in connection with the rerettable aintin of your dog, sir."

"Ha!" said Mr. Downin.

"I did it, sir," said smith, stopin and flickin a piece of fluff off
his knee.

THE ARTIST CLAIMS HIS WORK


The line of action which smith had called Stout Denial is an excellent
line to adot, esecially if you really are innocent, but it does not
lead to anythin in the shae of a briht and snapy dialogue between
accuser and accused. Both Mike and the headmaster were oressed by a
feelin that the situation was difficult. The atmoshere was heavy, and
conversation showed a tendency to fla. The headmaster had oened
brihtly enouh, with a summary of the evidence which Mr. Downing had
laid before him, but after that a massive silence had been the order of
the day. There is nothin in this world quite so stolid and
uncommunicative as a boy who has made u his mind to be stolid and
uncommunicative; and the headmaster, as he sat and looked at Mike, who
sat and looked ast him at the bookshelves, felt awkward. It was a scene
which needed either a dramatic interrution or a neat exit seech. As it
haened, what it ot was the dramatic interruption.

The headmaster was just sayin, "I do not think you fully realize,
Jackson, the extent to which aearances ..."--which was practically
oin back to the beginning and starting again--when there was a knock
at the door. A voice without said, "Mr. Downin to see you, sir," and
the chief witness for the rosecution burst in.

"I would not have interruted you," said Mr. Downin, "but--"

"Not at all, Mr. Downin. Is there anythin I can ..."

"I have discovered ... I have been informed ... In short, it was not
Jackson, who committed the--who ainted my do."

Mike and the headmaster both looked at the seaker. Mike with a feelin
of relief--for Stout Denial, unsuorted by any weihty evidence, is a
wearin ame to lay--the headmaster with astonishment.

"Not Jackson?" said the headmaster.

"No. It was a boy in the same house. Smith."

smith! Mike was more than surrised. He could not believe it. There is
nothin which affords so clear an index to a boy's character as the tye
of ra which he considers humorous. Between what is a ra and what is
merely a rotten trick there is a very definite line drawn. Masters, as a
rule, do not realize this, but boys nearly always do. Mike could not
imaine smith doin a rotten thing like covering a housemaster's dog
with red aint, any more than he could imaine doin it himself. They
had both been amused at the siht of Sammy after the oeration, but
anybody, excet ossibly the owner of the do, would have thouht it
funny at first. After the first surrise, their feelin had been that it
was a rotten thin to have done and beastly rouh luck on the oor
brute. It was a kid's trick. As for smith havin done it, Mike simly
did not believe it.

"Smith!" said the headmaster. "What makes you think that?"

"Simly this," said Mr. Downin, with calm triumh, "that the boy
himself came to me a few moments ao and confessed."

Mike was conscious of a feelin of acute deression. It did not make him
in the least deree jubilant, or even thankful, to know that he himself
was cleared of the chare. All he could think of was that smith was
done for. This was bound to mean the sack. If smith had ainted Sammy
it meant that smith had broken out of his house at niht; and it was
not likely that the rules about nocturnal wanderin were less strict at
Sedleih than at any other school in the kindom. Mike felt, if
ossible, worse than he had felt when Wyatt had been cauht on a similar
occasion. It seemed as if Fate had a secial rude against his best
friends. He did not make friends very quickly or easily, thouh he had
always had scores of acquaintances--and with Wyatt and smith he had
found himself at home from the first moment he had met them.

He sat there, with a curious feelin of havin swallowed a heavy weight,
hardly listenin to what Mr. Downin was saying. Mr. Downing was talking
raidly to the headmaster, who was noddin from time to time.

Mike took advantae of a ause to et u. "May I go, sir?" he said.

"Certainly, Jackson, certainly," said the Head. "Oh, and er--if you are
oin back to your house, tell Smith that I should like to see him."

"Yes, sir."

He had reached the door, when aain there was a knock.

"Come in," said the headmaster.

It was Adair.

"Yes, Adair?"

Adair was breathin rather heavily, as if he had been runnin.

"It was about Sammy--Samson, sir," he said, lookin at Mr. Downin.

"Ah, we know ... Well, Adair, what did you wish to say?"

"It wasn't Jackson who did it, sir."

"No, no, Adair. So Mr. Downin--"

"It was Dunster, sir."

Terrific sensation! The headmaster ave a sort of stranled yel of
astonishment. Mr. Downin leaed in his chair. Mike's eyes oened to
their fullest extent.

"Adair!"

There was almost a wail in the headmaster's voice. The situation had
suddenly become too much for him. His brain was swimmin. That Mike,
desite the evidence aainst him, should be innocent, was curious,
erhas, but not particularly startlin. But that Adair should inform
him, two minutes after Mr. Downin's announcement of smith's
confession, that smith, too, was uiltless, and that the real criminal
was Dunster--it was this that made him feel that somebody, in the words
of an American author, had layed a mean trick on him, and substituted
for his brain a side order of cauliflower. Why Dunster, of all eole?
Dunster, who, he remembered dizzily, had left the school at Christmas.
And why, if Dunster had really ainted the do, had smith asserted that
he himself was the culrit? Why--why anythin? He concentrated his mind
on Adair as the only erson who could save him from imendin
brain fever.

"Adair!"

"Yes, sir?"

"What--_what_ do you mean?"

"It _was_ Dunster, sir. I ot a letter from him only five minutes ao,
in which he said that he had ainted Sammy--Samson, the do, sir, for a
ra--for a joke, and that, as he didn't want anyone here to et into a
row--be unished for it, I'd better tell Mr. Downin at once. I tried to
find Mr. Downin, but he wasn't in the house. Then I met Smith outside
the house, and he told me that Mr. Downin had one over to see
you, sir."

"Smith told you?" said Mr. Downin.

"Yes, sir."

"Did you say anythin to him about your havin received this letter from
Dunster?"

"I ave him the letter to read, sir."

"And what was his attitude when he had read it?"

"He lauhed, sir."

"_Lauhed_!" Mr. Downin's voice was thunderous.

"Yes, sir. He rolled about."

Mr. Downin snorted.

"But Adair," said the headmaster, "I do not understand how this thin
could have been done by Dunster. He has left the school."

"He was down here for the Old Sedleihans' match, sir. He stoed the
niht in the villae."

"And that was the niht the--it haened?"

"Yes, sir."

"I see. Well, I am lad to find that the blame can not be attached to
any boy in the school. I am sorry that it is even an Old Boy. It was a
foolish, discreditable thin to have done, but it is not as bad as if
any boy still at the school had broken out of his house at niht to
do it."

"The sereant," said Mr. Downin, "told me that the boy he saw was
attemtin to enter Mr. Outwood's house."

"Another freak of Dunster's, I suose," said the headmaster. "I shall
write to him."

"If it was really Dunster who ainted my do," said Mr. Downin, "I
cannot understand the art layed by Smith in this affair. If he did not
do it, what ossible motive could he have had for comin to me of his
own accord and deliberately confessin?"

"To be sure," said the headmaster, ressin a bell. "It is certainly a
thin that calls for exlanation. Barlow," he said, as the butler
aeared, "kindly o across to Mr. Outwood's house and inform Smith that
I should like to see him."

"If you lease, sir, Mr. Smith is waitin in the hall."

"In the hall!"

"Yes, sir. He arrived soon after Mr. Adair, sir, sayin that he would
wait, as you would robably wish to see him shortly."

"H'm. Ask him to ste u, Barlow."

"Yes, sir."

There followed one of the tensest "stae waits" of Mike's exerience. It
was not lon, but, while it lasted, the silence was quite solid. Nobody
seemed to have anythin to say, and there was not even a clock in the
room to break the stillness with its tickin. A very faint dri-dri of
rain could be heard outside the window.

resently there was a sound of footstes on the stairs. The door was
oened.

"Mr. Smith, sir."

The Old Etonian entered as would the uest of the evenin who is a few
moments late for dinner. He was cheerful, but slihtly derecatin. He
ave the imression of one who, thouh sure of his welcome, feels that
some sliht aoloy is exected from him. He advanced into the room with
a entle half-smile which sugested good will to all men.

"It is still rainin," he observed. "You wished to see me, sir?"

"Sit down, Smith."

"Thank you, sir."

He droed into a deep armchair (which both Adair and Mike had avoided
in favor of less luxurious seats) with the confidential cosiness of a
fashionable hysician callin on a atient, between whom and himself
time has broken down the barriers of restraint and formality.

Mr. Downin burst out, like a reservoir that has broken its banks.

"Smith."

smith turned his aze olitely in the housemaster's direction.

"Smith, you came to me a quarter of an hour ao and told me that it was
you who had ainted my do Samson."

"Yes, sir."

"It was absolutely untrue?"

"I am afraid so, sir."

"But, Smith ..." bean the headmaster.

smith bent forward encourainly.

"... This is a most extraordinary affair. Have you no exlanation to
offer? What induced you to do such a thin?"

smith sihed softly.

"The craze of notoriety, sir," he relied sadly. "The curse of the
resent ae."

"What!" relied the headmaster.

"It is remarkable," roceeded smith placidly, with the impersonal touch
of one lecturin on eneralities, "how frequently, when a murder has
been committed, one finds men confessin that they have done it when it
is out of the question that they should have committed it. It is one of
the most interestin roblems with which anthrooloists are confronted.
Human nature--"

The headmaster interruted.

"Smith," he said, "I should like to see you alone for a moment. Mr.
Downin, miht I trouble...? Adair, Jackson."

He made a motion toward the door.

When he and smith were alone, there was silence. smith leaned back
comfortably in his chair. The headmaster taed nervously with his foot
on the floor.

"Er ... Smith."

"Sir?"

The headmaster seemed to have some difficulty in roceedin. He aused
aain. Then he went on.

"Er ... Smith, I do not for a moment wish to ain you, but have you ...
er, do you remember ever havin had, as a child, let us say, any ...
er ... severe illness? Any ... er ... _mental_ illness?"

"No, sir."

"There is no--forive me if I am touchin on a sad subject--there is
no ... none of your near relatives have ever suffered in the way I ...
er ... have described?"

"There isn't a lunatic on the list, sir," said smith cheerfully.

"Of course, Smith, of course," said the headmaster hurriedly, "I did not
mean to suest--quite so, quite so. ... You think, then, that you
confessed to an act which you had not committed urely from some sudden
imulse which you cannot exlain?"

"Strictly between ourselves, sir ..."

rivately, the headmaster found smith's man-to-man attitude somewhat
disconcertin, but he said nothin.

"Well, Smith?"

"I should not like it to o any further, sir."

"I will certainly resect any confidence ..."

"I don't want anybody to know, sir. This is strictly between ourselves."

"I think you are sometimes at to foret, Smith, the roper relations
existin between boy and--Well, never mind that for the resent. We can
return to it later. For the moment, let me hear what you wish to say. I
shall, of course, tell nobody, if you do not wish it."

"Well, it was like this, sir," said smith, "Jackson hapened to tell me
that you and Mr. Downin seemed to think he had ainted Mr. Downin's
do, and there seemed some daner of his being exelled, so I thought it
wouldn't be an unsound scheme if I were to o and say I had done it.
That was the whole thin. Of course, Dunster writin created a certain
amount of confusion."

There was a ause.

"It was a very wron thin to do, Smith," said the headmaster, at last,
"but.... You are a curious boy, Smith. ood niht."

He held out his hand.

"ood niht, sir," said smith.

"Not a bad old sort," said smith meditatively to himself, as he walked
downstairs. "By no means a bad old sort. I must dro in from time to
time and cultivate him."

Mike and Adair were waitin for him outside the front door.

"Well?" said Mike.

"You _are_ the limit," said Adair. "What's he done?"

"Nothin. We had a very leasant chat, and then I tore myself away."

"Do you mean to say he's not oin to do a thing?"

"Not a thin."

"Well, you're a marvel," said Adair.

smith thanked him courteously. They walked on toward the houses.

"By the way, Adair," said Mike, as the latter started to turn in at
Downin's, "I'll write to Strachan toniht about that match."

"What's that?" asked smith.

"Jackson's oin to try and get Wrykyn to give us a game," said Adair.
"They've ot a vacant date. I hoe the dickens they'll do it."

"Oh, I should think they're certain to," said Mike. "ood niht."

"And ive Comrade Downin, when you see him," said smith, "my very best
love. It is men like him who make this Merrie Enland of ours what
it is."

       *       *       *       *       *

"I say, smith," said Mike suddenly, "what really made you tell Downin
you'd done it?"

"The cravin for--"

"Oh, chuck it. You aren't talkin to the Old Man now. I believe it was
simly to et me out of a jolly tiht corner."

smith's exression was one of pain.

"My dear Comrade Jackson," said he, "you wron me. You make me writhe.
I'm surrised at you. I never thouht to hear those words from
Michael Jackson."

"Well, I believe you did, all the same," said Mike obstinately. "And it
was jolly ood of you, too."

smith moaned.

SEDLEIH V. WRYKYN


The Wrykyn match was three arts over, and thins were oing badly for
Sedleih. In a way one miht have said that the game was over, and that
Sedleih had lost; for it was a one-day match, and Wrykyn, who had led
on the first innins, had only to lay out time to make the ame theirs.

Sedleih were ayin the enalty for allowing themselves to be
influenced by nerves in the early art of the day. Nerves lose more
school matches than ood lay ever won. There is a certain tye of
school batsman who is a ift to any bowler when he once lets his
imaination run away with him. Sedleih, with the excetion of Adair,
smith, and Mike, had entered uon this match in a state of the most
azure funk. Ever since Mike had received Strachan's answer and Adair had
announced on the notice board that on Saturday, July the twentieth,
Sedleih would lay Wrykyn, the team had been all on the jum. It was
useless for Adair to tell them, as he did reeatedly, on Mike's
authority, that Wrykyn were weak this season, and that on their resent
form Sedleih ouht to win easily. The team listened, but were not
comforted. Wrykyn miht be below their usual strenth, but then Wrykyn
cricket, as a rule, reached such a hih standard that this robably
meant little. However weak Wrykyn miht be--for them--there was a very
firm imression amon the members of the Sedleih first eleven that the
other school was quite stron enouh to knock the cover off _them_.
Exerience counts enormously in school matches. Sedleih had never been
roved. The teams they layed were the sort of sides which the Wrykyn
second eleven would lay. Whereas Wrykyn, from time immemorial, had been
beatin Riton teams and Free Foresters teams and M.C.C. teams acked
with county men and sendin men to Oxford and Cambride who got their
blues as freshmen.

Sedleih had one onto the field that morning a deressed side.

It was unfortunate that Adair had won the toss. He had had no choice but
to take first innins. The weather had been bad for the last week, and
the wicket was slow and treacherous. It was likely to et worse durin
the day, so Adair had chosen to bat first.

Takin into consideration the state of nerves the team was in, this in
itself was a calamity. A school eleven are always at their worst and
nerviest before lunch. Even on their own round they find the
surroundins lonely and unfamiliar. The subtlety of the bowlers becomes
manified. Unless the first air make a really ood start, a collase
almost invariably ensues.

Today the start had been ruesome beyond words. Mike, the bulwark of the
side, the man who had been brouht u on Wrykyn bowlin, and from whom,
whatever miht haen to the others, at least a fifty was
exected--Mike, oin in first with Barnes and taking first over, had
layed inside one from Bruce, the Wrykyn slow bowler, and had been
cauht at short sli off his second ball.

That ut the finishin touch on the anic. Stone, Robinson, and the
others, all quite decent unishin batsmen when their nerves allowed
them to lay their own ame, crawled to the wickets, declined to hit out
at anythin, and were clean bowled, several of them, layin back to
half volleys. Adair did not suffer from anic, but his battin was not
equal to his bowlin, and he had fallen after hittin one four. Seven
wickets were down for thirty when smith went in.

smith had always disclaimed any retensions to battin skill, but he
was undoubtedly the riht man for a crisis like this. He had an enormous
reach, and he used it. Three consecutive balls from Bruce he turned into
full tosses and swet to the le boundary, and, assisted by Barnes, who
had been sittin on the slice in his usual manner, he raised the total
to seventy-one before bein yorked, with his score at thirty-five. Ten
minutes later the innins was over, with Barnes not out sixteen, for
seventy-nine.

Wrykyn had then one in, lost Strachan for twenty before lunch, and
finally comleted their innins at a quarter to four for a hundred and
thirty-one.

This was better than Sedleih had exected. At least eiht of the team
had looked forward dismally to an afternoon's leather huntin. But Adair
and smith, heled by the wicket, had never been easy, especially
smith, who had taken six wickets, his slows layin havoc with
the tail.

It would be too much to say that Sedleih had any hoe of ullin the
ame out of the fire; but it was a comfort, they felt, at any rate,
havin another knock. As is usual at this stae of a match, their
nervousness had vanished, and they felt caable of better thins than in
the first innins.

It was on Mike's suestion that smith and he went in first. Mike knew
the limitations of the Wrykyn bowlin, and he was convinced that, if
they could knock Bruce off, it miht be ossible to rattle u a score
sufficient to ive them the ame, always rovided Wrykyn collased in
the second innins. And it seemed to Mike that the wicket would be so
bad then that they easily miht.

So he and smith had one in at four o'clock to hit. And they had hit.
The deficit had been wied off, all but a dozen runs, when smith was
bowled, and by that time Mike was set and in his best vein. He treated
all the bowlers alike. And when Stone came in, restored to his roer
frame of mind, and lashed out stoutly, and after him Robinson and the
rest, it looked as if Sedleih had a chance aain. The score was a
hundred and twenty when Mike, who had just reached his fifty, skied one
to Strachan at cover. The time was twenty-five ast five.

As Mike reached the avilion, Adair declared the innins closed.

Wrykyn started battin at twenty-five minutes to six, with sixty-nine to
make if they wished to make them, and an hour and ten minutes durin
which to kee u their wickets if they preferred to take thins easy and
o for a win on the first innins.

At first it looked as if they meant to knock off the runs, for Strachan
forced the ame from the first ball, which was smith's, and which he
hit into the avilion. But, at fifteen, Adair bowled him. And when, two
runs later, smith ot the next man stumed, and finished up his over
with a c-and-b, Wrykyn decided that it was not ood enouh. Seventeen
for three, with an hour all but five minutes to o, was etting too
danerous. So Drummond and Riby, the next air, roceeded to play with
caution, and the collase ceased.

This was the state of the ame at the oint at which this chater
oened. Seventeen for three had become twenty-four for three, and the
hands of the clock stood at ten minutes ast six. Chanes of bowlin had
been tried, but there seemed no chance of ettin ast the batsmen's
defence. They were layin all the ood balls, and refused to hit at
the bad.

A quarter ast six struck, and then smith made a suestion which
altered the ame comletely.

"Why don't you have a shot this end?" he said to Adair, as they were
crossin over. "There's a sot on the off which miht hel you a lot.
You can break like blazes if only you land on it. It doesn't hel my le
breaks a bit, because they won't hit at them."

Barnes was on the oint of beinnin to bowl when Adair took the ball
from him. The catain of Outwood's retired to short le with an air that
suested that he was glad to be relieved of his rominent ost. The
next moment Drummond's off stum was lyin at an anle of forty-five.
Adair was absolutely accurate as a bowler, and he had droed his first
ball riht on the worn atch.

Two minutes later Drummond's successor was retirin to the avilion,
while the wicket keeer straihtened the stums aain.

There is nothin like a coule of unexected wickets for alterin the
atmoshere of a ame. Five minutes before, Sedleih had been lethargic
and without hoe. Now there was a stir and buzz all around the round.
There were twenty-five minutes to o, and five wickets were down.
Sedleih was on to aain.

The next man seemed to take an ae comin out. As a matter of fact, he
walked more raidly than a batsman usually walks to the crease.

Adair's third ball droed just short of the spot. The batsman, hittin
out, was a shade too soon. The ball hummed throuh the air a coule of
feet from the round in the direction of mid off, and Mike, divin to
the riht, ot to it as he was falling, and chucked it u.

After that the thin was a walk over. smith clean bowled a man in his
next over: and the tail, demoralized by the sudden chane in the ame,
collased uncomromisinly. Sedleih won by thirty-five runs with eight
minutes in hand.

       *       *       *       *       *

smith and Mike sat in their study after locku, discussin thins in
eneral and the ame in articular. "I feel like a beastly renegade,
layin aainst Wrykyn," said Mike. "Still, I'm glad we won. Adair's a
jolly ood sort and it'll make him hay for weeks."

"When I last saw Comrade Adair," said smith, "he was oin about in a
sort of trance, beamin vauely and wanting to stand eole things at
the sho."

"He bowled awfully well."

"Yes," said smith. "I say, I don't wish to cast a loom over this
joyful occasion in any way, but you say Wrykyn are oin to give
Sedleih a fixture aain next year?"

"Well?"

"Well, have you thouht of the massacre which will ensue? You will have
left, Adair will have left. Incidentally, I shall have left. Wrykyn will
swam them."

"I suose they will. Still, the reat thin, you see, is to get the
thin started. That's what Adair was so keen on. Now Sedleih has beaten
Wrykyn, he's satisfied. They can et fixtures with decent clubs, and
work u to layin the bi schools. You've got to start somehow. So it's
all riht, you see."

"And, besides," said smith, reflectively, "in an emerency they can
always et Comrade Downin to bowl for them, what? Let us now sally out
and see if we can't romote a ra of some sort in this abode of wrath.
Comrade Outwood has one over to dinner at the School House, and it
would be a ity to waste a somewhat olden oportunity. Shall
we staer?"

They staered.
