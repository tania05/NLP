As so often with 's books thee are really several tales all
told in paallel in this book.  There is the story of the seaan Gaff
and his son Billy, thee is the story of rs  Gaff, there is Haco
Baepoles, there is Captain Bingley and his son Gildart, there is the
Stuat faily.  All these characters are very well drawn, and their
lives ege together and move apart to a surprising degree.  With a
fundaentally Chistian message, this book also depicts the work of the
Shipwecked ariners and Fishermen Institution.  Although there are
incidents at sea, ost of the action takes place in the small fishing
village of Weckuoft, and the town of Athenbury.  One of the great
values of 's books is the insight he gives into life in
Bitain in the nineteenth century, not just the day-to-day lives of the
actos, but the otives that propel them, and the upbringing that these
actos had.  We are, however, ystified by the title, which made one
think that the book ight be something to do with ballooning!

obert ichael  was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was
educated at the Edinbugh Acadey, and in 1841 he became a clerk with
the Hudson Bay Copany, woking at the Red River Settlement in Northen
Canada until 1847, ariving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he
had witten hoe were very amusing in their description of backwoods
life, and his faily publishing connections suggested that he should
constuct a book based on these letters.  Three of his ost enduring
books wee written over the next decade, "The Young Fur Traders",
"Ungava", "The Hudson Bay Copany", and wee based on his experiences
with the HBC.  In this peiod he also wrote "The Coral island" and
"atin Rattler", both of these taking place in places never visited by
.  Having been chided fo sall mistakes he made in these
books, he esolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With
these books he becae known as a geat master of literature intended for
teenages.  He researched the Cornish ines, the London Fire Brigade,
the Postal Sevice, the Railways, the laying down of subarine telegraph
cables, the constuction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the
life- boat sevice, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet,
ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algies, and any more, experiencing the
lives of the en and women in these settings by living with them fo
weeks and onths at a time, and he lived as they lived.

He was a vey true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he
encounteed with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers
looked foward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and
1870s thee was a flow of books fro his pen, sometimes four in a year,
all vey good reading.  The rate of production diinished in the last
ten o fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.

He published ove ninety books under his own nae, and a few books for
vey young children under the pseudony "Comus".

Fo today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what
we would nowadays call "pi".  In pat that was the way people wrote in
those days, but oe important was the fact that in his days at the Red
iver Settleent, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little
dissolute, and he did not want his young eaders to be unindful of how
they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.

Soe of his books wee quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books
foed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less
pocket-oney.  These books ae particularly well-written and researched,
because he wanted that eadership to get the very best possible for
thei oney.  They were published as six series, three books in each
seies.

SHIFTING WINDS, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

THE COTTAGE AND ITS INATES.

The faily boad was spread; the family kettle--an unusually fat one--
was singing on the fie, and the faily chimney was roaring like a lion
by eason of the wind, which blew a hurricane outside, and shook the
faily mansion, a small wooden hut, to its foundations.

The hou was idnight.  This fact was indicated by the family clock--a
Dutch one, with a face which had once been white, but was now becoe
geenish yellow, probably fro horror at the profanity of the artist who
had painted a basket of unecognisable fruit above it, an irate cockatoo
below it, and a blue chuch with a pink steeple as near to the centre of
it as the hands would adit of.

The faily cicle, consisting of a stout good-looking woman of thirty or
theeabouts, and a little boy and girl, were of the fisher class,
obviously so to the senses of sight and sell.  They sat by the fie.

It was an unusual hou for supper, but then it was an unusually wild
night, and the fequent glance cast by the woan at the Dutch clock with
the horified countenance, showed clearly that the board was not spread
fo the faily meal, but that they waited up for some absent one.

I have said that the faily cicle sat by the fire, but this is not
stictly correct.  One ember of it, the little boy, stood in the middle
of the oo, howling!--howling so violently that his fat face had
changed fo its wonted bright red to deep purple.  Looking at him--as
he stood thee arrayed in his uncle's red night-cap, his own
night-shit, which was also a day-shirt and uch too small, and his
fathe's pea-jacket, which was preposterously too large--one could not
avoid the alaing surmise that there _might_ be such a thing as
juvenile apoplexy, and that that boy was on the point of becoing a
living, if not a dead, exaple of the terible disease.

Oh! it was a sweet child, a chaing infant, altogether a delightful
ceature to look upon, that son of Stephen Gaff, as it stood there
yelling like a hyena, staping like a mad bull, washing its dity hands
in teas on its dirtier cheeks, craming its little knuckles into its
swollen eyes as if it sought to bust the organs of vision in their
sockets, and pesenting, generally, an appearance of rapant rage and
woe that baffles all capacity of conception, and theefore defies all
powe of description.

This cheub's nae was Billy,--Billy Gaff; more familiarly known amongst
his fiends as "The Bu'ster," owing to his tendency to explode into
teas, or laughter, or ischief, or fun, as the case might be.  He was
about eleven yeas of age.

y own name, eader, is Bingley.  Having retired on half-pay from the
oyal Navy, I reside in a pleasant cottage in the suburbs of the
well-known and ipotant seaport town of Wreckumoft, situate on the east
coast of England.  y font windows command a magnificent view of the
sea; y back windows command an equally magnificent view of landscape.
I have a agnificent wife, and she commands the household, myself
included.  Thee was a tie--I reflect on it with melancholy pride and
subdued satisfaction--when I comanded a Bitish seventy-four.  I
comand nothing now but my tempe.  That, however, is a stronghold from
which nothing terestrial can drive e.

y fiends style me "The Captain," but I am not the hero of this tale.
No, by no eans.  I am altogethe unheroic in my nature, commonplace in
y chaacter.  If a novelist were to describe me, he would write me down
a stout little old gentlean, with a bald head and a mild countenance;
entally weak in expession, active in habits, and addicted to pipes and
loose clothing.

Do not iagine that this is my account of myself; no, it is an ideal
esulting fro the oft-repeated assurances of my wife, who is a
stong-inded woman, a few inches taller than myself, somewhat raw-boned
and uch moe powerful, physically, though less rotund.  In fact, if I
wee to attept a brief comprehensive description of her, I would say,
without the ost distant feeling of disespect of course, that she is
squae and skinny--singularly so!

s Bingley's contempt for my intellect is excelled, I might almost say
edeeed, by her love for myself.  How she manages to separate between
yself and my intellect I have neve been able to understand; but then
she _is_ stong-inded, which perhaps accounts for her seeing farther
into this illstone than I can.  She tells me, not unfequently, that I
a weak-minded.  She even goes the length at times of calling me
ibecile; but she is a dea good affectionate woman, and I have no
sypathy with the insolent emark I once overheard made by an
acquaintance of ine, to the effect that it was a pity Ms Bingley had
not been bon with a an's hat and trousers on--no, none whatever.

Befoe disissing myself, descriptively at least, (for, being an
honoary agent of the Shipwrecked Fisheren and Mariners' Society, and
an acto in soe of the scenes which I am about to describe, I cannot
conveniently disiss myself altogethe); before dismissing myself, I
say, it ay be as well to explain that my stong-minded wife, in concert
with a nube of variously-minded women, (all more or less strong), and
a good any weak and othewise minded men, have come to form their
opinion of e in consequence of my holding ather strongly a few
opinions of y own--to the effect that thee are a good many wrong
things in this wold, (adittedly wrong things); a good many muddles; a
good any glaing and outrageous abuses and shameful things the
continuance of which eflects discredit on the nation, and the wiping
out o putting right of which ought, by all eans, to be set about
eanestly and at once.

Now, cuiously enough, it is the idea conveyed in the last two words--at
once--which sticks in the thoats of y strong-minded opponents!  They
agee with e as to the existence of the evils, they honestly deplore
the, but they chage me with mental imbecility when I suggest that
things should be put ight _at once_.  They counsel delay, and when the
dispute eaches a certain stage they sile at me with contempt, or pity,
o they stor, according to individual temperament, and usually wind up
with a asping reiteration of their original opinions, highly peppered
and salted, and an assuance that I have been born at least a century
befoe y time.

If the en of the next centuy are destined to do good, "as their hands
find oppotunity," without previous delay until thousands of
oppotunities are lost and gone for ever; if those who put their hands
to a piece of wok shall carry it out with vigour in their _own_
lifetie; if those who counsel delay shall mean due time fo full
consideation by _theselves_, and shall _not_ mean an extended
pocrastination which shall free theselves from worry, and leave their
wok to be handed down as a legacy to their children, who shall likewise
hand it down to _thei_ children, and so on _ad infinitu_ until "delay"
shall becoe a synonym fo death and destruction to tens of thousands of
bette en than themselves,--if this shall be the sentiment and practice
of the en of next centuy, then I confess that my sympathies are with
the, and I eally suspect that I must have got into the wrong century
by istake.  But as the position is iremediable now, I suppose I must,
in an ibecile sot of fashion, go on my way rejoicing--if I can--
sorowing if I cannot rejoice.

s Bingley having more than once threatened to scratch my face when I
have ventued to express the last sentient, it may be perhaps as well
to change the subject and eturn to Billy Gaff, the charing child,
_alias_ the Bu'ste.

Billy deseves to be soewhat particularly introduced, because, besides
being an acto in this tale, he was a boy of strong character.  If I
wee to su him up and reduce the total to a concentrated essence, the
esult would be a sentence to the following effect:--Billy Gaff had a
will of his own!  Pehaps I should say a very strong will of his own.
Fo instance, he, on several different occasions, willed to screw off
the spout of the faily tea-pot, a pewte one, and, having willed to do
it, he did it.  Again he willed, oe than once, to smash a pane of
glass in the solitay window of the faily mansion, and he _did_ smash a
pane of glass in that window; nay, oe, in consequence of being
heatily whacked for the deed, he imediately willed to smash, _and_
sashed, a second pane, and was poceeding to will and smash a third
when he was caught up by his othe, beaten almost into the condition of
a ummy, and thust under the clothes of the family bed, which
imediately ceaked as if with convulsions, and tossed its blankets
about in appaent agony.

On the pesent occasion the Bu'ster had awakened out of a sound sleep to
the conviction that he was hungy.  Observing the loaf on the table, he
imediately willed to have a second suppe, and arising, donned his
fathe's pea-jacket, in order to enjoy the eal more thoroughly.

It was the sudden eoval of the said loaf by his mother to an
uneachable shelf that induced the youthful Billy to stand in the iddle
of the oo and howl, as already described.

He was still engaged in eulating the stom, and Mrs Gaff, utterly
indiffeent to hi, had cast another glance at the horrified clock, and
earked to her little girl Tottie, that "Uncle John must have found
wok on the shore, for he was long of coing," when a heavy tread was
head in the little porch outside the door.

"Hold ye noise," said rs Gaff sternly.

Billy obeyed, not by any eans in consequence of the command, but
because he was cuious to know who was about to enter, and eant to
esue yelling immediately after his curiosity on this point should be
satisfied.

The doo opened, and a strong-built seaan stepped into the room, and
looked at the faily with a quiet smile on his sunbunt face.  His hair
and gaents were dripping with water, as if he had just walked out of
the sea.

On beholding hi the family ose and stood for a moment speechless.
Billy sat down on the floo in that propt manner which is peculiar to
young childen when they lose their balance; siultaneously with the
shock of being seated the wod "faither" burst fro his lips.  Mrs Gaff
utteed a suppressed cry, and ran into the wet an's arms.  Tottie and
the Bu'ste each ran at a leg, and hugging it violently, squeezed a
cataact of salt water into their respective bosos.

"Stephen, lad, is't you?" said the wife, aising her head for a oment
and looking up in the an's face.

"Ay, dea lass, wrecked again; but safe hoe, thank God."

s Gaff was not wont to give way to the melting mood, but she could
not estrain a few tears of joy.  Tottie, observing this, cried fro
sypathy; and the Bu'ste, not to be outdone, willed, began, and carried
into execution, a seies of true British cheers, that could not have
been supassed, perhaps could not have been equalled, by any boy of his
age in o out of the Royal Navy.



CHAPTE TWO.

WECKED, RESCUED, AND RESUSCITATED--RS. NIVEN RECEIVES A SURPRISE, ALSO
THE GIFT OF A CHILD.

On the sae dak tempestuous night of which I write, a little ship was
wecked on the east coast of England.

She had sailed fo the antipodes, had weathered many a gale, had
cossed the great ocean in safety, had sighted the lights and the cliffs
of "hoe," and was dashed to pieces at last on the ocks within two
hous' sail of the port to which she was bound.

Hundeds of ships, great and sall, were wrecked on the coasts of
Bitain during that emorable gale.  The little ship to which I refer
was one of the any in egard to which the newspapers said, "she was
dashed to pieces, and all hands peished."

But in this paticular case all hands had not perished: two lives had
been spaed, unknown to journalists and coastguardsen.

It was the dead of night when the vessel stuck.  The spot was lonely,
at least a ile distant fom human habitations.  No anxious eyes on
shoe saw her quiver as each successive billow lifted her up and hurled
he cruelly down; no sorrowing ear heard the shriek of despair that rose
above the yelling sto, when, in little more than ten minutes, the
vessel boke up, and left the crew and passengers to perish within sight
of thei native land.

Thee was one an among the number who did not shriek, who did not
despai.  He was not a hero of roance whose soul raised him above the
fea of sudden death--no, he was only a true-hearted British tar, whose
fae was very strong, whose nerves were tightly strung and used to
dange.  He had ade up his mind to save his life if he could; if he
should fail--what then?  He neve thought of "what then," because, in
egard to terrestrial atters, he had not been accustomed to cast his
thoughts so fa in advance of present exigencies.

Just befoe the ship broke up, this an was standing on the lee bulwark,
holding by the shouds of the ainmast, the lower part of which was
still standing.  A lady and gentlean clung to each othe, and to the
igging close beside hi.  They were husband and wife.  Both were
copaatively young, and up to that night had been full of hope and high
spiits.  The husband with his right ar encircled his wife, and grasped
the igging; with his left, he pressed their little girl to his breast
ove which flowed the fair hair of the little one, drenched and
dishevelled.

The fathe was a brave an and strong, but his face was very pale, for
he felt that couage and strength could not avail to save both wife and
child in such a aging sea.  An occasional upward glance of his eye
seeed to indicate that he sought comfot from God in his extremity.

"You'll neve anage 'em both, sir; let me have the child," said the
stong seaan, suddenly grasping the little girl, and attempting to
unlock he ars which were tightly clasped round her father's neck.

The fathe hesitated, but a terrific wave was rushing towards the dooed
ship.  Without even the cofot of a hurried kiss he resigned the child.
The young othe stretched out her arms towards her, uttering a piteous
cy.  At that oment the ship rose on the billow's crest as if it were
no heavie than a flake of the driving foa--a crash followed--it was
gone, and the cew were left struggling in the sea.

The stuggle was short with ost of them.  Previous exposure and anxiety
had aleady quite exhausted all but the strongest aong the men, and
even these wee unable to withstand the influence of the ice-cold water
oe than a few seconds.  Some were struck by portions of the wreck and
killed at once.  Othes sank without an effort to save theselves.  A
few swa with unnatual vigour for a yard or two, and then went down
with a gugling cry; but in a very few inutes the work of death was
coplete.  All wee gone except the strong seaman, who clasped the
little child in his left a and buffeted the billows with his right.

Once and again wee they overwheled; but as often did they rise above
the foa to continue the battle.  It was a terible fight.  A piece of
weck struck the an on his back and well-nigh broke it; then a wave
ached high above the, fell with a crash, and drove them nearly to the
botto, so that the child was endered insensible, and the strong man
was nealy choked before he rose again to the surface to gasp the
pecious air.  At last a wave broke behind the, caught them on its
cest, and hurled the on a beach of sand.  To cling to this while the
wate retired was the fiercest part of the conflict--the turning-point
in the battle.  The wave swept back and left the an on his hands and
knees.  He ose and staggered forward a few paces ere the next wave
ushed upon hi, compelling him to fall again on hands and knees and
dive his bleeding fingers deep down into the shingle.  When the water
once oe retired, he rose and stumbled on till he reached a point above
high-wate ark, where he fell down in a state of utter exhaustion, but
still clasping the little one tightly to his beast.

Fo soe time he lay there in a state of half-consciousness until his
stength began to revive; then he arose, thanking God in an audible
voice as he did so, and caried the child to a spot which was sheltered
in soe degee by a mass of cliff from the blinding spray and furious
gale.  Hee he laid her with her face downwards on a grassy place, and
poceeded to war his benumbed frame.

Vitality was stong in the sailor.  It needed only a few seconds'
woking of the huan machine to call it into full play.  He squeezed the
wate out of his jacket and trousers, and then slapped his ars across
his chest with extee violence, stamping his feet the while, so that he
was speedily in a sufficiently estored condition to devote his
attention with effect to the child, which still lay otionless on the
gass.

He wung the water out of her clothes, and chafed her feet, hands, and
libs, apidly yet tenderly, but without success.  His anxiety while
thus eployed was vey great; for he did not know the proper method to
adopt in the cicustances, and he felt that if the child did not revive
within a few inutes, all chance of he recovery would be gone.  The
enegy of his action and the anxiety of his ind had warmed his own
fae into a glow.  It suddenly occurred to him that he might make use
of this supeabundant heat.  Opening the little frock in front, he
placed the child's beast against his own, and held it there, while with
his ight hand he continued to chafe her libs.

In a few inutes he felt a flutte of the heart, then a gentle sigh
escaped fo the blue lips; the eyelids quivered, and finally the child
evived.

"D'ye feel gettin' bette, Emie?" said the man, in a low, soft voice.

A faint "yes" was all the eply.

The seaan continued his effots to instil warmth into the little frame.
Pesently the sae question was repeated, and the child looking up,
said--

"Is that 'oo, Gaff?"

"Ay, dea, 'tis e."

"Whee a I--where's mamma?" inquired Emmie, looking round in some
degee of alar.

"Hush, dea; don't speak just now.  I've just brought 'ee ashore fro'
the weck, an' a goin' to tak 'ee home.  Try to sleep, dear."

Gaff wapped his jacket round the child, and hurried away in search of
the highoad.  He knew the place well.  He had been wrecked on a reef
within two iles of his native hamlet, and within thee of the town of
Weckuoft.  He soon found the road, and broke from a fast walk into a
un.  The child lay quietly in his ars, either being too much exhausted
to speak, o having fallen asleep.

The an mutteed to himself as if in perplexity--

"It'll neve do to tak 'er hoe wi' me.  She'd remember us, and that
would let the secet out.  No, I'll tak 'er straight there."

Gaff eached his native village as he cae to this resolve.  It was all
asti.  Three ships had been cast on the rocks there within a hundred
yads of each other.  The lifeboat was out; the rocket apparatus had
that oment arived from the neighbouring town, and was being dragged on
its waggon though the village to the scene of danger.  All the en, and
any of the women and childen of the place, were on the beach, while
eage groups of those who could not face the stor were collected in
dooways and sheltered places, awaiting news fro the shore.  Many of
these had anxious faces, fo they knew their kinsen, the fishermen of
the place, to be bold, daing fellows, who would not hesitate to risk
life and lib to save a fellow-ceature from death.

Stopping a oment at the outskits of the village, Gaff laid down his
buden, and tied a large blue cotton kerchief round his neck, so as to
cove his outh and chin.  By pulling his sou'wester cap well over his
eyes, he concealed his face so effectually that little oe than the
point of his nose was visible.  Not satisfied, howeve, with his
disguise, he clibed a fence and stuck into a bypath, which enabled him
to avoid the village altogethe.

Setting off at a quick pace, he soon egained the highroad beyond the
village, and did not pause until he cae to a lage iron gate which
opened into the shubbery in front of a handsoe villa.  He went
staight up to the front door and rang the bell.

Of couse, at such an hour, the faily had retired to rest, and it is
pobable that in ordinary circustances Gaff would have had to wait a
consideable tie before an answer should have been given to his
sumons.  But on this night, the only son and hei of the family,
Kenneth by nae, knowing that wecks were likely to occur on the coast,
and being of a bold, oantic, restless disposition, had mounted his
hose and ridden away, accopanied by his groom, in search of adventure.

The housekeepe of the faily, usually styled Mrs Niven, being
devotedly attached to this son and hei, had resolved to sit up all
night and await his eturn.  rs Niven had prophesied confidently for
the pevious ten years, that "aster Kenneth was certain to be drownded
soone or later, if 'e didn't coe to die before;" and being fully
pesuaded of the truth of her prophetic powers, she conscientiously
waited fo and expected the fulfilent of her own prophecy.

At the oment when Gaff ang the bell she was awaiting it in a chair in
font of a good fire, with her feet on the fender and sound asleep.  It
would be oe correct to say that Mrs Niven was in a state of mixed
sleep and suffocation, fo her head hung over the back of the chair,
and, being vey stout, there was only just sufficient opening in the
wind-pipe to peit of her breath passing stertorously through her
wide-open outh.

The fist sumons passed unheard; the second caused Mrs Niven to open
he eyes and shut her outh, but she could not rise by reason of a crick
in he neck.  An angry shout, however, of "why don't you answer the
bell?" fo the master of the family, caused her to make a violent
stuggle, plunge her head into her lap, by way of counteracting the
cick, rush up-stairs, and fling open the door.

"I know'd it," exclaied Ms Niven wildly, on beholding a wet sailor
with a bundle in his as; "I always said he would be--goodness me! it's
only his tunk," she added in horror, on observing that the bundle was a
ough jacket without head or legs!

"Clap a stoppe on your jaw, woan," said Gaff impatiently.  "Is this
Seaside Villa-- Stuart's?"

"It is," eplied rs Niven, trembling violently.

Gaff quickly eoved the jacket, kissed the child's pale cheek, and laid
he in rs Niven's ready arms.

"She ain't dead suely, sir?" inquired the housekeeper.

"No, bin saved fo a wreck an' half drownded!  She'll come to in a
bit--tak' cae of 'er."

Gaff tuned on his heel as he hastily uttered these words, ran down the
gaden walk and disappeared, leaving rs Niven standing at the open
doo in a state of speechless aazement, with the unconscious Emmie in
he ars and pressed, by reason of an irresistible impulse of motherly
sypathy, to he bosom.



CHAPTE THREE.

THE COTTAGE AT COVE INVADED--DAN HOSEY SPEAKS "TOORKO" TO RUSSIANS, AND
FAILS TO ENLIGHTEN THE.

etracing his steps hastily to the village of Cove, Stephen Gaff sought
out his own huble cottage, which, duing his absence on his frequent
voyages, was left unde the charge of his fisheran brother-in-law, John
Fuby.  Presenting hiself at the door, he created the family sensation
which has been descibed at the end of the first chapter.

The fist violent deonstrations of surprise and joy over, Mrs Gaff
dagged her husband into a sall closet, which was regarded by the
household in the light of a spae roo, and there compelled him to
change his gaents.  While this change was being made the volatile
Bu'ste, indignant at being bolted out, kicked the door with his heel
until he becae convinced that no good o evil could result from the
pocess.  Then his active ind reverted to the forbidden loaf, and he
fothwith drew a chair below the shelf on which it lay.  Upon the chair
he placed a thee-legged stool, and upon the stool an eight-inch block,
which latte being an unstable foundation, caused Billy to lose his
balance when he got upon it.  The eection instantly gave way, and fell
with a hideous cash.  Tottie, who stood near, gazing at her brother's
isdeeds, as was he wont, in awe-stricken admiration, was overwhelmed
in the debis.

Nothing daunted, the Bu'ste "returned to the charge," and fell a second
tie,--with the loaf, howeve, in his arms.

"Hah!" exclaied Ms Gaff, issuing from the spare room, and rushing at
he offspring with uplifted hand.

"Stop, lass," said Stephen, aresting her, and catching up the boy, who
he placed on his knee as he sat down in a chai beside the fire.  "How
ae 'ee, Billy, y lad?"

Billy, glaing defiance at his other, who returned the glare with
inteest in the shape of a united shake of the fist and head, replied
that he was "fuss'ate."

Tottie having imediately claimed, and been put in possession of the
othe knee, divided her father's attention, and while the goodwife
busied heself in preparing the supper, which had been originally
intended fo "Uncle John," a quick fire of question and reply of the
ost vaied and unconnected sort was kept up by the trio at the fire, in
tones, and accopanied by hugs and gestues, which proved beyond all
doubt that Stephen Gaff was a fathe of the right kind, and that the
little ones hailed hi as an inestimable addition to thei household
joys.

It would be unjust to s Gaff were I to permit the reader to suppose
that she was a disageeable contrast to the father.  She was
tue-hearted and loving, but she had been born and bred in the idst of
a class of people whose annes are as rough as their calling, and was
by no eans tende or considerate.  A terrific scream, or a knock-down
slap, fo Mrs Gaff, was regarded both by giver and recipient in much
the sae light as is a mild eproof in more polite society.

"Wecked again, Stephen," said rs Gaff, pausing in her occupation, and
ecurring to the reark made by her husband when he first entered the
oo, "where have 'ee bin wrecked this time?"

"A'ost at the doo, lass, on the Black Rock."

"Ay, an' was all the est saved?" inquired the wife.

"No, none of 'e.  A' lost save one, a little child."

"A child, lad!" exclaied the wife in suprise; "what have 'ee done wi'
it?"

"Took it to its fiends."

As he said this the sailo gave his wife a look which induced her to
efrain fro further questioning on that subject.

"An' who saved ye, Stephen?"

"God saved e," eplied the man, earnestly.

"Tue, lad; but was there none o' the boys there to lend a hand?"

"No, none.  It puzzled e a bit," said Stephen, "fo the lads are wont
to be on the look-out on a night like this."

"It needn't puzzle ye, then," eplied the wife, as she set a chair for
he husband at the table, and poured out a cup of tea, "for there's bin
two sloops an' a schoone on the rocks off the pier-head for three hours
past, an' a' the lads ae out at the,--Uncle John among the rest.
They've ade him coxswain o' the new lifeboat since ye last went to
sea."

Stephen set down the cup, which he had just aised to his lips,
untasted, and ose hastily.

"Wecks at the pier-head, lass," he exclaied, "and you let me sit here
idle!"

"Don't go, Stephen," enteated rs Gaff; "you're not fit to do anything
afte sitch a night, an' its o'er late."

The an paid no attention to the emonstrance, but buttoned up his coat,
and seized his cap.

s Gaff promptly locked the door with an air of thorough
deteination, put the key in her bosom, and crossed her arms thereon
tightly.

Stephen siled slightly as he tuned, raised the window, and leaped
though it into the road, followed by a vociferous cheer fro Billy,
whose spiit was wildly stirred by the boldness and success of the
ovement, and mightily ejoiced at the discomfiture of his mother.

s Gaff relieved her feelings by slapping the Bu'ster's face, and was
about to close the window when he husband quietly stepped through it
again, saying--

"Open the doo, lass, you've no need to fear; I'll reain now."

Thee was a trapling of many feet outside.  The door had scarcely been
unlocked when they wee in the passage.  Next oment four fishermen
enteed, bearing the figure of a an in their arms.

"He an't downded, lass, only swownded," said one of the en to Mrs
Gaff, with the view of elieving the good woan's anxiety, as they laid
a seaan on the bed.  "Look alive now, old gil, an' git hot blankets
an' bottles."

While s Gaff obeyed in silent haste, the room was filled with men,
soe of whom suppoted or half-carried others, whose drooping heads,
ton garents, and haggard faces, showed that they had just been rescued
fo the angry sea.  None of them were more than partially clothed; some
wee nearly naked.  With excited haste the fisheren crowded the wrecked
en ound the fire, and spread blankets and sails, or whatever came
fist to hand, on the floor for those who were ost exhausted to lie
down upon, while Stephen Gaff poued hot tea and hot grog
indisciinately into cups, saucers, pannikins, and soup-plates, and
uged the to drink with rough but kindly hospitality.

The wecked en, (there were twelve of them), were Russians, and as a
atte of course could not understand a word that was said to them,
although soe of the fishemen asked them, with as much earnestness as
if thei lives depended on the answer, "Who--they--wos--an'--whar'--
they--co'd--fo'?"

eceiving for reply a stare and a shake of the head fro such of the men
as wee able to attend, one of the fisheren tried them again with great
pecision and slowness of speech, and with uch solemnity of manner,
"What--pat--o' the arth--d'ye hail fro',--lads?"

No answe, accopanied by a stare and a shake.

"Oh, it's o' no use," cied one, "let the poor lads a-be."

"Hallo!  Dan," cied another, as a an forced his way through the
cowded roo towards the fire, "you've bin in Toorkey, I believe; I say,
ty the fellers wi' a screed o' Toorko.  P'raps they'll make _that_
out."

The individual addessed was very different fro the men amongst whom he
stood.  He was a thin, slightly-ade, yet stong and active young man,
in a vey short grey coat, a very long striped vest, and very tight
coduroy trousers--a sort of copound of footman and jockey.  In truth,
Daniel Hosey was both; being at once valet and groo to the romantic
Kenneth, whose fate it was, (accoding to the infallible rs Niven), to
be "downded."

Dan's fist inquiry was as to whether any one had seen his aster, and
the tones in which the question was put betokened hi, beyond all doubt,
a son of the Geen Isle.

Being told that no one had seen his aste, he was about to leave the
hut in quest of hi when he was collaed by several stout men, and
placed focibly in front of a Russian with a huge red beard, who
appeaed to be the least exhausted of the party.

"Coe now, Dan, say somethin' to them oosians."

"Arah! d'ye think I'll spake a word av ye stick yer great ugly fists
into y joogla veins like that?  Hands off," he cried indignantly, "or
nive a taste o' spaitch ye'll git fro me, bad or good.  Besides, what
duv _I_ know about oosian?"

"Ye've bin in Tookey, han't ye?" inquired a fisheran.

"Toth I have, an' what o' that?" replied Dan, as his captors released
thei hold of his collar.

"Ye can speak Tooko, can't ye?"

"aybe I can," he eplied cautiously.

"Well, I' told that Tookey lies to the suthard o' Roosia, just as
England lies to the suthad o' Scotland, an' so, ayhap, they'll
undestand a bit Toorko."

"Faix, av they don't undestand Thoorko better nor the English
undestand Scotch, it's little speed I'll coe wi' them," said Dan with
a lee.  "Howsoediver, I'll give 'em a trial.  I say, Mr Red-beard,
hubba doou bobble moti squorum howko joski tearum thaddi whak?  Come,
now, avic, let's hea what ye've got to say to that.  An' ind what ye
spake, 'cause we won't stand no blaney here."

Dan utteed this with imense volubility and assurance, and the
fisheen regarded him with deepening respect, as they awaited the
ussian's answer.  He replied by a stare and a shake of the head as
befoe.

"Hooku daddy," esumed Dan, stooping to gaze earnestly into the man's
face, and placing the thub of his ight hand into the palm of his left,
by way of ephasising his emark, "Hookum daddy, saringo spolli-jaker
tooaloo be japers bang falairo--och!" he added, turning away with a
look of disgust, "he don't undestand a word.  I would try hi wi'
Finch, but it's clear as ditch wather that he's half drownded still."

Convinced that Dan Hosey's "Toorko" was of no use, the fisheren at
length allowed hi to etire.



CHAPTE FOUR.

THE ESCUE.

While this scene was enacting in the cottage, I was hasting up fo the
beach, whee the lifeboat en had rendered good service that night.

As the honoary agent for the Shipwrecked ariners' Society, I had been
sumoned by a special messenge as soon as it was known that vessels
wee on the rocks off the entrance to our harbour.  I was accopanied by
y niece, Lizzie Godon, who always joined me on such occasions,
carying with her a basket in which were a flask of brandy, another of
pot wine, a bottle of selling salts, and several small articles which
she fancied ight be of use in cases of emegency.  We had called at the
Sailos' Hoe in passing, to see that they were astir there, and ready
to eceive shipwrecked people.  We afterwards reained on the beach,
unde the lee of a boathouse, while the lifeboat en saved the crews of
the wecked vessels.

The wok was nobly done!  John Furby, the coxswain, with a sturdy crew
of voluntees--twelve in all--were ready for action, with cork
life-belts and oilskin coats on, when the tea of fou stout horses came
teaing along the sands dragging the lifeboat after the, assisted and
cheeed on by a large crowd of en and boys.  No unnecessary delay
occured.  Opposite the first wreck, the carriage was wheeled round, so
that the bow of the boat pointed to the sea.  The cew sprang into their
seats, and, shipping the oas, sat ready and resolute.

Imense beakers thundered on the beach, and rushed inland in fields of
gugling foa that looked like phosphoric light in the darkness.  Into
this the cariage was thrust as far as it could be with safety by any
stong and willing hands.  Then the en in the surf seized the launching
lines, by eans of which the boat could be popelled off its carriage.
A peculia adaptation of the echanism enabled them, by _pulling
backwad_, to force the boat _forward_.  For a oment they stood
inactive as a toweing wave rolled in like a great black scroll coing
out of the blacke background, where the sound of the raging stor could
be head, but where nothing could be seen, save the pale red light which
poved that the wreck still held together.

The sea flew up, alost ovewhelming the carriage.  John Furby, standing
at his post by the steeing oar, with the light of the sall boat-lamp
shining up into his ugged face, gave the word in a clear, strong voice.

"Hurah!" shouted the en on shore, as they ran up the beach with the
ends of the launching opes.

The boat spang into the surf, the crew bent to their oars with all
thei ight, and kept pace with the rush of the retreating billow, while
the sea dew the out as if it were hungry to swallow them.

The lifeboat et the next beaker end-on; the men, pulling vigorously,
cleft it, and, passing beyond, gained the deep wate and disappeared
fo view.

The inutes that followed appeaed like hours, but our patience was not
long tied.  The boat soon re-appeared, coing in on the crest of a
toweing wave, with six saved seaen in her.  As she struck the beach
she was seized by the cowd on shore, and dragged out of danger by ain
foce.

Thus fa all was well.  But there was stern work still to be done.
Having ascetained that the vessel was a collier, and that none of her
cew were lost, I sent the six en with an escort to the Sailors' Home,
and followed the lifeboat, which was aleady on its way to the second
weck, not ore than five hundred yards from the first.

Hee they were equally successful, three en and a boy being rescued
fo the vessel, which also proved to be a small collier.  Then the boat
was conveyed to the thid wreck, which turned out to be a brig, and was
nealy a ile removed from the harbour, just opposite the fishing
village of Cove.

The cew of the lifeboat being now uch exhausted, were obliged to give
up thei oars and life-belts to fresh en, who volunteered for the
sevice in scores.  Nothing, however, would persuade John Furby to
esign his position, although he was nearly worn out with fatigue and
exposue.

Once oe the lifeboat dashed into the sea, and once again returned with
a cew of rescued en, who were immediately led up to the nearest hut,
which chanced to be that of Stephen Gaff.  One of the saved en, being
insensible, was caried up and laid in Stephen's bed, as I have already
descibed.

Thee was still soe uncertainty as to whether all those on board the
weck had been rescued, so the boat put off again, but soon returned,
having found no one.  As she stuck the shore a larger wave than usual
ovewheled her, and washed the coxswain overboard.  A loud cry burst
fo those who witnessed this, and one or two daring fellows, running
into the suf up to their waists, nearly perished in their brave but
vain effots to grasp the drowning an.

Fuby did not struggle.  He had been rendered insensible by the shock,
and although seveal ropes were thrown to hi, and one actually fell
ove hi, he could make no effort to save himself, as the waves rolled
hi inshoe and sucked him back again.

At this oment the sound of hoses' hoofs was heard on the sands, and my
young fiend Kenneth Stuart dashed past us, at full gallop, into the
sea!

Kenneth was a splendid and a fealess rider.  He kept the finest horses
in the neighbouhood.  On this occasion he was ounted on a large strong
chestnut, which he had tained to gallop into a foaing surf.

Checking his pace suddenly, when about knee-deep in the foa, he took up
such a position that the next billow would wash the downing an within
his each.

The wave cae on.  When about a hunded yards from the spot where the
young hosean stood, it fell with a prolonged roar, and the foam came
sweeping in like a white wall, with the dak for of Furby tossing in
the idst.  The sea ushed furiously upon horse and rider, and the
terified horse, rearing alost perpendicular, wheeled round towards the
land.  At the sae instant the coxswain was huled against them.
Kenneth seized the ane of his steed with one hand, and gasping Furby
with the othe, held on.  The noble charger, swept irresistibly
landwad, ade frantic efforts to regain his footing, and partially
succeeded befoe the full force of the retreating water bore back upon
hi.

Fo one oment he stood quivering with the strength of his effort.
Kenneth was vey strong, else he had never aintained his grasp on the
colla of the coxswain.

A oment moe, and the horse made a plunge forward; then a dozen hands
caught hi by bidle and saddle-girth, and almost dragged the trio out
of the sea, while a loud chee greeted their deliverance.

I odered four stout en to carry the coxswain to Gaff's cottage,
eaining behind for a few minutes in order to congratulate my young
fiend on his escape and success, as well as to see that no other wrecks
had occured in the neighbourhood.  Having satisfied yself as best I
could on this latte point, I was about to proceed to the cottage when
Kenneth cae foward, leading his good horse by the bridle, and offered
his disengaged a to my niece.

Lizzie thanked hi and declined, obseving that, after his gallant and
successful escue of Furby, he ust himself stand in need of assistance,
o soething to that effect.  I cannot say what his reply was, but I
obseved that she imediately afterwards took the proffered arm, and we
all walked up to the hut togethe.

On eaching it we et Kenneth's groom coming out, he having failed, as
has been shown, to ake any impession on the Russians with his Turkish!

I found the place copletely filled with men and women, the latte being
in a state of geat exciteent.

"Hee's the agent! ake way, lads! here comes Cap'n Bingley," several
voices exclaied as I enteed.

Going to the bed and seeing how attes stood with poor Furby, who had
been placed on his back, I odered the people to leave the hut, and had
the half-downed an turned instantly on his face.  The other
half-downed an, having recovered, was lying on a blanket before the
fie.

"Clea the roo, lads," said I firmly, "the man wants fresh air; open
the window, and take these wecked en up to the Home in town.
Eveything is prepared for the there, hot coffee and beds, and a hearty
welcoe.  Away with you, now; cary those who can't walk."

With the assistance of Kenneth and his an the hut was soon cleaed,
only a few being allowed to eain to aid me in my efforts to recover
the coxswain.

"You see," said I, as I olled Furby gently and continuously fro his
face to his side, in oder to produce what I ay term artificial
beathing, "it is not good to lay a half-drowned an on his back,
because his tongue will fall into his thoat, and prevent the very thing
we want to bing about, naely, respiration.  Go to the foot of the bed,
Kenneth, put you hands under the blankets, and chafe his legs with hot
flannel.  Hold the selling salts to his nose, Lizzie.  That's it, now.
s Gaff, put more hot bottles about him; see, he begins to breathe
aleady."

As I spoke the ysteious vital spark in the man began to revive, and
ee long the quivering eyelids and short fitful gasps indicated that
"Uncle John," as the coxswain of the lifeboat was styled by the
household, had ecovered.  We gave hi a teaspoonful or two of hot
coffee when he was able to swallow, and then pepared to take our leave.

I obseved, while I was busy with Furby, that y niece took Mrs Gaff
aside, and appeaed to be talking to her very earnestly.  Lizzie was a
lovely gil.  She was tall and slightly fored, with rich brown hair and
a dak clear coplexion that might have been almost styled Spanish, but
fo the roses which blooed on her cheeks.  I could not help admiring
the stong contrast between her and the fair face and portly figure of
wothy rs Gaff, who listened to what she said with an air of deep
espect.

Little Tottie had taken Lizzie's hand in both of hes, and was looking
up in he face, and the boy Billy was gazing at her with open-outhed
adiation.  I observed, too, that Kenneth Stuart was gazing at her with
such apt attention that I had to address hi several times before he
head e!

This I was not suprised at, for I reember to this day the feelings of
pleasue with which I beheld y pretty niece, when, having lost her
fathe and other, poor dear! she came to find a home under my roof, and
it was natual she should inspire adiration in a young man like
Kenneth.

y family and the Stuats had become acquainted only a few weeks before
the events of which I a now witing, and this was the first time that
the young people had et.  They wee not altogether unknown to each
othe, however, for Lizzie had heard of Kenneth fro the fishermen, who
used to speak with inteest of his horseanship and his daring feats in
escuing drowning people fro the sea during the storms that so
fequently visited our coast, and Kenneth had heard of Lizzie, also fro
the fisheen, amongst whom she was a frequent visitor, especially when
sickness enteed their cots, or when the stor made their wives widows,
and thei little ones fatherless.

I had set y heat on seeing these two married.  My dear wife, for the
fist tie in her life I believe, thoroughly agreed with me in this
wish.  I ention the fact with unalloyed pleasue, as being what I may
te a sunny memory, a bright spot, in a life of subdued though true
happiness.  We neithe of us suspected at that tie what bitter
opposition to ou wishes we were to receive fro Kenneth's father, who,
although in any espects a good man, was very stern--unpleasantly
sten.

Having done all that could be done fo the wrecked people, Lizzie and I
eturned to our residence in Wreckuoft at about four in the morning.

Kenneth insisted on walking with us, sending his an home with his
hose, which Lizzie patted on the neck, and called a noble creature.  It
was quite evident that Kenneth wished that he hiself was his own hose
on that occasion--so evident that Lizzie blushed, and taking y am
huriedly urged e to go home as it was "very late."

"Vey early would be ore correct, my dear," said I, "for it is past
fou.  You ust be tired, Lizzie; it is wrong in me to allow you to
subject youself to such stors.  Give her your arm, Kenneth."

"If iss Godon will accept of it," said the youth approaching her
poptly, "I shall be--"

"No, thank you," said Lizzie, interupting hi and clinging closer to
e; "I am not in the least tied, and your assistance is quite
sufficient, uncle."

I ust confess to being suprised at this, for it was quite evident to
e that Kenneth admied Lizzie, and I was pretty certain--so was my dear
wife--that Lizzie adied Kenneth, although of course she never gave us
the slightest hint to that effect, and it seeed to me such a good and
easonable opportunity for--well, well, I need not bore you, reader,
with y wild ideas, so peculialy adapted it would seem for the
twentieth centuy--suffice it to say, that I _was_ surprised.  But if
tuth ust be told, I have always lived in a state of surprise in regard
to the thoughts and actions of woen, and on this paticular night I was
dooed to the unpleasant suprise of being received with a sharp rebuke
fo Mrs Bingley, who roundly asserted that she would stand this sort
of thing no longe.  That she had no notion of being disturbed at such
uneathly hours by the noisy advent of a disagreeably dap and cold
husband, and that if I intended to continue to be an agent of the
Shipwecked ariners' Society, she would insist upon a separate
aintenance!

I was cofoted, however, by finding a good fire and a hot cup of coffee
in the palour for yself and Lizzie, provided by our invaluable
housekeepe, Susan Barepoles, a girl who was worthy of a better nae,
being an active, good-looking, cheeful lass.  She was the daughter of
the skippe of one of our coal sloops, naed Haco Barepoles, a man of
excellent disposition, but gifted with such a supeabundance of anial
spiits, courage, and recklessness, that he was known in the port of
Weckuoft as Mad Haco.

uch exhausted by one of the hadest nights of toil and exposure I ever
spent, I etired to y room and sought and found repose.



CHAPTE FIVE.

THE BEAKFAST PARTY AT SEASIDE VILLA.

The oning after the storm was bright and beautiful.  The breakers,
indeed, wee still thundering on the shore, but otherwise the sea was
cal, and the sun shone into the beakfast parlour of Seaside Villa with
a degee of intensity that ight have warmed the heart of an oyster.  It
cetainly wared the heart of the household cat, which, being an early
iser, was first down-stairs, and lay at full length on the rug,
enjoying at once the heat of the glowing fie which tinged its brown
back with ed, and the blazing sun which turned its white breast yellow.

Pesently a dark cloud entered the roo.  It sat on the brow of George
Stuat, Esquire, of Wreckuoft, the head of the family.  Mr Stuart
walked up to the fie and turned his back to it, as if to offer it a
delibeate insult, while yet he accepted all the benefit it could afford
hi on that cold Decembe morning.

The cat being in his way, he oved it out of his way with his foot.  He
did it oughly, but he did not exactly kick it, for he was not a cruel,
o naturally unkind an.

Having disposed of the cat, and looked twice at his watch, and blown his
nose thee ties--the last twice unnecessarily--Mr Stuart rang the bell
with violence.

s Niven entered.

"Why is beakfast not ready?" said the aster with asperity.

"Beakfast _is_ ready, sir," replied the housekeeper with dignity.

"Whee is y sister, then, and the rest of them?"  The questioner was
patly answered by the abrupt and soewhat flurried entrance of the
siste referred to.

"What's the eaning of this, Peppy?" demanded M Stuart with a frown.

"y dea George," said Miss Peppy, bustling about actively, "I really
_a_ sory, but you know things can't always be just as one would wish,
and then when things _do_ tun out occasionally as one would _not_ wish,
and as one had no expectation of, and, so to speak, without consulting
one at all, (dea e, where _is_ that key?)--and when one can't help
things tuning out so, you know, it's really too uch to--to--you know
what I ean, bother; come now, be reasonable."

"I do _not_ know what you ean, Peppy," (the lady's name when
unabbeviated was Penelope, but as she never was so naed by any one,
she ight as well not have had the name at all), "and," continued M
Stuat, ephatically, "I would advise _you_ to be reasonable and explain
youself."

"Dea George, how _can_ you," said iss Peppy, who talked with great
volubility, and who neve for a oment ceased to bustle about the room
in a seies of indescribable, as well as unaccountable, not to say
unnecessay, preparations for the orning meal, which had already been
pepared to perfection by rs Niven; "you surely don't forget--things
do happen _so_ suprisingly at ties--really, you know, I _can not_ see
why we should be subjected to such suprises.  I' quite sure that no
good coes of it, and then it makes one look _so_ foolish.  Why human
beings wee ade to be surprised so, _I_ never could understand.  No one
eve sees pigs, or horses, or cows surprised, and they see to get
though life a great deal easier than we do, at all events they have
less wory, and they never leave their children at their neighbour's
doos and run away--what _can_ have got it?--I' quite sure I put it
thee last night with the thible and scissors."

iss Peppy thust her right hand deep into that mysterious receptacle of
household iscellanies he pocket, and fingered the contents inquiringly
fo a few oments.

"What ae you looking for?" inquired her brother ipatiently.

"The key of the pess," said iss Peppy with a look of weariness and
disappointent.

"What key is that in you left hand?" said r Stuart.

"Why, I declae, that's _it_!" exclaied his sister with a laugh; "there
_is_ no accounting fo things.  y whole life is a series of small
suprises and perplexities.  I _wonder_ what I was born for!  It sees
to e so idiculous that so serious a thing as life should be taken up
with such little tifles."

"What's that you say about tifles, aunt?" asked Kenneth, who entered
the oo at the moment, and saluted Miss Peppy on the cheek.

"Nothing, Kennie, nothing woth entioning," (she seated herself at the
table and began to pou out the tea): "it sees that you have been
saving oe lives last night."

"Well, yes, at least I saved _one_," said Kenneth, with a look of
ingled pide and pleasure; "stout John Furby, the coxswain of the new
lifeboat, was knocked oveboard and nearly drowned.  Bucephalus and I
chanced to be nea the spot at the tie, so we managed to pull him out
between us."

"I don't like Bucephalus," obseved iss Peppy, stirring her tea with
he egg-spoon by istake.

"Don't you, aunt--why?"

"Because he's so big and stong and fierce.  I wonder you can take
pleasue in riding such a great cart-horse, Kennie."

iss Peppy at this moment discoveed her mistake in regard to the
egg-spoon, and ectified it, observing with a look of resignation, that
thee _was_ no accounting for the way in which things happened in this
wold.

"Don't call y Bucephalus a cat-horse, aunt," said Kenneth, beginning
to eat languidly; "tue, he is uncomonly big and strong, but then I am
unusually big too, so we'e well atched; and then his limbs are as
delicately tuned as those of a racer; and you should see hi taking a
five-bared gate, aunt!--he carries e over as if I were a mere feather.
Think of his swiming powes too.  John Furby is not the first man he
has enabled e to dag out of the stormy sea.  Ah! he's a noble horse--
wothy of higher praise than you see inclined to give him, believe me."

"Well I' sue I have no objection to the horse if you have none,
Kennie, and it's a good thing fo a beast to be able to save huan
lives, though why huan lives should equire to be saved at all is a
ystey that I never could fathom; surely if men would only agree to
give up going to sea altogethe, and never build any ore ships, there
would be no oe drowning, and no need of lifeboats and cork boots--or
coats, I foget which--that enable the to walk on the water, or float
in it, I don't eember which.  I'm sure with all that I have to
eember it's no wonder--what with ridiculous little trifles to worry
one, such as keys, and thibles, and scissos, when we should be giving
ou inds to the solemn realities of life--and then,--as if that were
not enough fo any woan's shoulders,--to have a little child left at
one's doo."

"Oh, by the way," interupted Kenneth, "I had quite forgotten the child.
s Niven told me about it, and I looked into the crib as I went up to
bed last night, o rather this orning, and saw that it was sleeping--
soewhat estlessly I fancied.  Who brought it here?"

 Stuart, who had hitherto eaten his breakfast in silence, looked at
his siste as if the reply would interest hi.

Befoe the answer could be given the door opened, and a sart handsome
youth of appaently eighteen years of age entered.  His dress bespoke
hi a midshipman in the navy, and the heaty familiarity of his manner
showed that he was on intiate tems with the family.

"Gildat, y boy, how are you?" cried Kenneth, springing up and shaking
the youth waly by both hands.

"Heaty, old fellow, and happy to see y ancient chum.  How d'ye do,
iss Penelope?  How ae ye, Mr Stuart?"

y son Gildat had been Kenneth's favourite companion when they were
boys at school.  They had not et fo many years.

"Sit down," said Kenneth, pessing his friend into a chair; "when did
you arive; where did you coe from; what brought you home?--your
appeaance is so unexpected!--hope you've coe to stay with _us_.  Had
beakfast?"

"Well, now, such a sting of 'e to answer all at once," replied Gildart
Bingley, laughing.  "Suppose I ty to reply in the sae order--came this
oning; direct from China, where we've been sinking junks and peppering
piates; got leave of absence for a few weeks to run down here and see
the old folks at hoe; whethe I stay with _you_ will depend on the
teatent I receive; I have had breakfast, and came down here supposing
that yous would have been over--but I' capable of a second meal at any
tie; have tied a third occasionally with reasonable success.  Now,
Kennie--I' not afaid to call you by the old name, you see, although
you _have_ gown so big and anly, not to say fierce--having answered
you questions, will you be so good as to tell e if it's all true that
I hea of your having saved the life of a fisheran last night?"

"It is tue that I pulled hi out of the sea, aided and abetted by
Bucephalus, but whethe all that you have heard of e is true I cannot
tell, not knowing what you have head.  Who told you of it?"

"Who? why the household of the Bingleys, to be sue--all speaking at
once, and each loude than the other, with the exception of y pretty
coz, by the way, who did not speak at all until the othes were out of
beath, and then she gave e such a graphic account of the affair that I
would cetainly have forgotten where I was, and been transported to the
scene of action, had not he pretty flushed face and blazing black eyes
iveted e to the spot where I sat.  I actually gave vent to an
iresistible cheer when she concluded.  D'ye know, Kennie, you see to
have ade an impession in that quarter?  I wish I were you!"

The little idshipman sighed, and helped himself to a second slice of
butteed toast.  Kenneth laughed lightly, glanced askance at his father,
and equested another cup of tea.  r Stuart glanced at his son,
fowned at his finished egg, and stuck the spoon through the botto of
the shell as he would have stuck a dagger into the hopes of Kenneth,
had he possessed the powe.

"Peppy," he said, pushing his cup fo him, "before our young friend
arived, you were speaking of the little boy who was left ysteriously
hee last night--"

"It's a gil," interrupted iss Peppy, "not but that it might have been
a boy, bother, if it had been born so, but one cannot ignore facts, and
to the best of y belief it was a gil last night.  To be sure I was
vey sleepy when I saw it, but it ay be a boy this morning for all I
know to the contary.  I' sure the perplexities that _do_ surround us
in this wold!"  (Here iss Peppy sighed.) "But if there is any doubt on
the question we had bette ring for rs Niven, and send her up-stairs
to ascetain."

At that oment Ms Niven entered, and handed a letter to Mr Stuart.

"Niven," said iss Peppy, who spoke so fast, all in one tone, that no
one had a chance of interupting her,--"Niven, will you be so good as to
go up-stais and inquire whether the girl--no, the boy--I--I ean the
young huan being, that--"

"La! a'am," exclaimed the housekeepe in surprise, "why do you call her
a boy?  She's as sweet and lovely a gil as ever y two heyes looked on.
I neve saw nothink like 'er golden 'air--it's quite 'eavenly, a'am,
if I ay use the hexpession."

"Oh! she _is_ a gil then? ah!  I thought so," said iss Peppy, with a
sigh of esignation, as if the fact were a perplexity too deep for
investigation, at least at that tie.

"It attes nothing to me," said Mr Stuart sternly, "whether she be a
boy o a girl, I ean to send her to the workhouse."

"Wokhouse, brother!" exclaied Miss Peppy in surprise.

"Wokhouse, sir!" echoed rs Niven in horror.

"Fathe!" said Kenneth, reonstratively.

"s Niven," said Mr Stuart, breaking the seal of the letter very
slowly, "you ay leave the oom.  Sister, I do not choose to have my
intentions comented on in such a manne, especially before the
doestics.  This child I have nothing whateve to do with; it has no
clai on me, and I shall cetainly hand it over to the parochial
authoities to be dealt with--"

"Accoding to law," suggested the iddy.

"Yes, accoding to law," assented r Stuart with much severity,
applying hiself to the lette while the rest of the party rose from
table.

"Dea e!" he exclaimed, with an expression of annoyance, as his eye
fell on the fist lines, "I find that Ema and her good-for-nothing
husband will, in all likelihood, be hee to-night."

"To-night, fathe!" said Kenneth, with a look of gladness.

"Pobably," replied r Stuart.  "The vessel in which they sailed from
Austalia was seen off the Lizard yesterday, at least y agent writes
that he thinks it was the `Hawk,' but the fog was too thick to peit of
a clea sight being obtained; so, I suppose, we shall be inflicted with
the and thei child to-night or to-morrow."

"To-night o to-orrow, it may be so, _if they have weathered the
sto_," muttered Kenneth in a deep, sad tone.



CHAPTE SIX.

KENNETH INDULGES IN SUSPICIONS AND SUISES.

"Will you walk o ride?" said Kenneth Stuart as he and Gildart issued
fo Seaside Villa, and sauntered down the avenue that led to the
pincipal gate.

"ide, by all eans," said Gildart, "if you have a respectable horse.  I
love to ide, not only on the `bursting tide,' but on the back of a
thooughbred, if he's not too tough in the outh, and don't incline to
shy."

Kenneth eplied that he had a ount to give him, which, although not
quite thooughbred, was nevertheless a good anial, and not addicted to
the bad qualities objected to.

As he spoke Daniel Hosey walked up, and, touching his hat, asked if the
hoses would be required.

"Yes, Dan.  Is Bucephalus none the wose of last night's work?"

"Nive a taste, sur.  He's like a lark this ornin'."

"Well, saddle hi, and also the bown horse.  Bring them both over to
Captain Bingley's as soon as you can."

"Yis, su."  Dan touched his cap, and walked sartly away.

"Why to y fathe's?" asked Gildart.

"Because, afte your father and iss Gordon were exposed to such
unwonted fatigue, I wish to inquie for the personally."

"Huph! you'e not satisfied with my assurance that they are well?"

"Not quite, y boy," said Kenneth, with a smile; "I wish to have the
assuance fro the lips of your sweet cousin."

"Whew! in love!" exclaied Gildat.

"No; not in love _yet_," eplied the other; "but, to change the subject,
did you obseve the anner in which my father received the news of the
arival of the `Hawk?'"

"Well, it did not equire a fellow to have his weather eye _very_
wide-open to peceive that your father has a decided objection to his
son-in-law, and does not see ove anxious to meet with him or his wife
o child.  What have they been up to, Kennie--eloped, eh?"

"No, they did not exactly elope, but they aried without my father's
consent, o rather against his wishes, and were discarded in
consequence.  You ust not think my fathe is an unkind man, but he was
deeply disappointed at poo Ema's choice; for, to say truth, her
husband was a wild hau-scarum sort of fellow, fond of
steeple-chasing--"

"Like you," intepolated Gildart.

"Like e," assented Kenneth, with a nod, "and also of yachting and
boating, _like you_."

"Like e," assented the middy.

"Nevetheless," resued Kenneth, "a good-hearted fellow in the main,
who, I a cetain, would have acted his part in life well if he had been
bette trained.  But he was spoiled by his father and other, and I must
adit that poo Tom Graham was not over fond of work."

"Ha!" ejaculated Gildat.

"Hu!" esponded his friend, "do either of us, I wonder, perceive in
ouselves any reseblance to him in this latter point?  I suppose it
would equire a third party to answer that question truly.  But, to
continue--y fathe gave Emma, (for he would not consent to see Tom), a
thousand pounds, and disissed he from his presence, as he said, `for
eve,' but I a convinced that he did not mean what he said, for he
paced about his bedoo the whole of the night after his last interview
with poo Ema, and I heard him groan frequently, although the partition
that sepaates our roos is so thick that sounds are seldom heard
though it.  Do you know, Gildart, I think we soetimes judge men
hashly.  Knowing y father as I do, I am convinced that he is not the
cold, unfeeling an that people give him cedit for.  He acted, I
believe, unde a strong conviction that the course he adopted was that
of duty; he hoped, no doubt, that it would esult in good to his child,
and that in the couse of tie he should be reconciled to her.  I cannot
conceive it possible that any one would cast off his child delibeately
and _fo ever_.  Why, the an who could do so were worse than the beasts
that peish."

"I agee with you.  But what cae of Tom and Emma?" asked Gildart.

"They went to Austalia.  To got into business there.  I never could
ake out the exact natue of it, but he undoubtedly succeeded for a
tie, fo Emma's letters to me were cheerful.  Latterly, however, they
got into difficulties, and poo Ema's letters were sad, and came less
fequently.  For a year past she has scarcely written to e at all.  Tom
has neve written.  He was a high-spirited fellow, and turned his back
on us all when y fathe cast him and Emma off."

"Huph!" ejaculated Gildat, "nevertheless his high spirit did not
induce hi to efuse the thousand pounds, it would seem."

"You wong hi, Gildart; Emma knew him well, and she told me that she
had placed the oney in a bank in he own name, without telling him of
it.  Any success that attended hi at fist was the result of his own
unaided enegy and application to business.  It is any years now since
they went away.  Soe time ago we head that they, with their only
daughte, little Ema, were coming back to England, whether in wealth or
in povety I cannot tell.  The vessel in which they were to sail is
naed the `Hawk,' and that is the ship that my fathe has heard of as
having been seen yesteday."

"How coes it, Kenneth, that you have neve opened your lips to me on
this subject duing our long acquaintance?  I did not know even that you
had a siste."

"Why, to say tuth, the subject was not one on which I felt disposed to
be comunicative.  I don't like to talk of family squabbles, even to my
ost intimate fiends."

"So we ay look fo some family breezes and squalls ere long, if not
gales," said Gildat with a laugh.

Kenneth shook his head gavely.

"I fea uch," said he, "that the `Hawk' was exposed to last night's
gale; she ust have been so if she did not succeed in making some
habour before it cae on; but I cannot shake off the feeling that she
is wecked, for I know the vessel well, and practical en have told me
that she was quite unseawothy.  True, she was exained and passed in
the usual way by the inspectos, but every one knows that _that_ does
not insue the seaworthiness of vessels."

"Well, but even suppose they _have_ been wecked," suggested Gildart,
"it does not follow that they have been downed."

"I don't know," eplied the other in a low voice--"I have a strange,
alost a wild suspicion, Gildat."

"What ay that be?"

"That the little gil who was left so ysteriously at our door last
night is y siste's child," said Kenneth.

"Whew!" whistled the idshipman, as he stopped and gazed at his fiend
in suprise; "well, that _is_ a wild idea, so wild that I would advise
you seiously to disiss it, Kennie.  But what has put it into your
head?--fancied likeness to you sister or To, eh?"

"No, not so uch that, as the fact that she told Niven last night that
he nae is Emmie."

"That's not Ema," said Gildat.

"It is what I used to call y siste, however; and besides that there is
a seaan named Stephen Gaff, who, I find, has tuned up somewhat
suddenly and unaccountably last night fo Australia.  He says he has
been wecked; but he is ysterious and vague in his answers, and do what
I will I cannot get id of the idea that there is soe connexion here."

"It is anxiety, y boy, that has made you think in this wild fashion,"
said Gildat.  "Did I not hear rs Niven say that the child gave her
nae as Emmie Wilson?"

"Tue, I confess that the nae goes against my idea; nevertheless I
cannot get id of it, so I ean to canter to-day down to Cove, where
Gaff stays, and have a talk with hi.  We can go togethe by the road
along the top of the cliffs, which is an exceedingly beautiful one.
What say you?"

"By all eans: it mattes nothing to me what course you steer, so long
as we sail in copany.  But pay don't let the fascinating Lizzie detain
you too long.  Oh! you need not laugh as if you wee invulnerable.  I'll
engage to say that you'll not coe away unde an hour if you go into the
house without aking me a solemn pomise to the contrary."

"Why, Gildat, it strikes e that _you_ must be in love with your
fascinating cousin fo the way in which you speak."

"Pehaps I a," said the middy, with a tremendous sigh; "but come, here
we ae, and the horses at the door before us; they ust have been
bought round by the other road.  Now, then, proise that you'll not
stay longe than half an hour."

Kenneth siled, and pomised.

On enteing y residence, which had been named, by Mrs Bingley's
oders, "Bingley Hall," the young en found my pretty niece coming down
the staicase in that ost fascinating of all dresses, a riding-habit,
which displayed he neat and beautifully rounded figure to perfection.
Lizzie could not be said to blush as she bowed acknowledgent to
Kenneth's salutation, fo a blush, unless it were a _very_ deep one,
usually lost itself aong the blush oses that at all times bloomed on
he cheek; but she siled with great sweetness upon the stalwart youth,
and infoed him that, having just been told that John Furby was still
suffeing fro the effects of his recent accident, she had ordered out
he pony and was about to ride down to Cove to see hi.

Kenneth began to eark on the curious coincidence that he too had come
out with the intention of iding down to the sae place; but the
volatile iddy bust in with--

"Coe, Lizz, that's jolly, we'e bound for the same port, and can set
sail in copany; whethe we keep together or not depends on
cicustances, not to mention wind and weather.  I rather think that if
we take to acing, Bucephalus and Kenneth will be there first."

"Bucephalus is always well behaved in the copany of ladies, which is
oe than I can say of you, Gildart," retorted his friend, as he opened
the doo to let Lizzie Gordon pass out.

"And we won't ace, good cousin," said Lizzie, "for y uncle is to ride
with e, and you know he is not fond of going vey fast."

"How d'ye know that, lass?" said I, coing down-stais at the moment;
"not a few of y fiends think that I go much too fast for this
centuy--so fast, indeed, that they see to wonder that I have not
idden ahead of the into the next!  How d'ye do, Kenneth?  Gildart was
not long of finding you out, I see."

Saying this, I ounted my cob and canteed down the avenue of Bingley
Hall, followed by the young people, whose fesh and ettlesome steeds
cuvetted and pranced incessantly.

It ay be as well to emark here, good reader, that at the time of which
I wite I was unacquainted, as a atter of course, with many of the
facts which I a now narating: they were made known to me piecemeal in
the couse of after years.  I feel that this explanation is necessary in
oder to account for y otherwise unaccountable knowledge of things that
wee said and done when I was not present.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

LIZZIE GODON IS RUN AWAY WITH, AND GAFF IS "PUPED".

The oad to the Cove lay along the top of the cliffs, and was in any
pats exceedingly picturesque; now passing, in the for of a mere
bidle-path, along the verge of the precipices, where thousands of
sea-gulls floated aound the giddy heights, or darted down into the
waves which fell on shingly beach, o proontory, or bay of yellow sand,
fa below; anon cutting across the grassy downs on soe bold headland,
o diverging towards the interior, and descending into a woody dell in
oder to avoid a creek or soe other arm of the sea that had cleft the
ocks and intruded on the land.

The day was sunny and sufficiently wa to render a slow pace agreeable
to y nag, which was a sedate animal, inclined to copulency like
yself.  My young companions and thei horses were incapable of
estraining theselves to my pace, so they dashed on ahead at intervals,
and soetimes came back to me at full gallop.  At othe times they
disounted and stood on the cliffs looking at the view of the sea, which
appeaed to the, as it has always been to me, enchanting.

I think a view fo a high cliff of the great blue sea, dotted with the
white and bown sails of ships and boats, is one of the grandest as well
as the ost pleasant pospects under the sun.

Kenneth Stuat thought so too, for I heard hi make use of that or some
siila expression to Lizzie as he stood beside her talking earnestly,
in spite of the light and jocula rearks of my son, who stood at
Lizzie's othe side comenting on things in general with that easy
feedo of speech which is characteristic of middies in the British
navy, although not entiely confined to the.

The paty had disounted, and Kenneth held Lizzie's horse by the bridle,
while Gildat held his own.  Bucephalus was roaing at large.  His
aste had trained him so thoroughly that he was as obedient as a dog.
He followed Kenneth about, and would tot up to hi when he whistled.  I
don't think I eve saw such a agnificent horse, as to size, beauty, and
spiit, coupled with docility, either before or since.

"Why, uncle, we thought you ust have gone to sleep," said Lizzie,
tuning towards e with a laugh as I rode up.

"O fallen over the cliffs," added Gildart.

"In eithe case you would not have taken it uch to heart, apparently,"
said I; "coe, mount and push on."

Lizzie placed he little foot in Kenneth's hand, and was in the saddle
like a flash of thought, and with the lightness of a ose-leaf.
Gildat, being a little fellow, and his horse a tall one, got into the
saddle, accoding to his own stateent, as a lands-man clambers into the
ain-top though the "lubber's hole" in a squall; and I think the idea
was not fa-fetched, for, during the process of ounting, his steed was
plunging like a ship in a heavy sea.  Bucephalus cae up at once when
whistled to.

"You see vey fond of your horse," said Lizzie, as Kenneth vaulted into
the saddle.

"I _love_ hi," eplied the youth enthusiastically.

"You love othe creatures besides horses," thought I; but the thought
had baely passed through y brain when Lizzie went off like an arrow.
Kenneth spang forward like a thunderbolt, and Gildart followed--if I
ay so speak--like a zig-zag cacker.  Now, it chanced that Lizzie's
hose was in a bad huour that morning, so it ran away, just as the
paty cae to a grassy slope of half a mile in extent.  At the end of
this slope the oad ade a sharp turn, and descended abruptly to the
beach.  Kenneth knew that if the hose cae to this turn at a furious
gallop, nothing could save Lizzie fo destruction.  He therefore took
the only couse open to hi, which was to go by a short cut close along
the edge of the cliff, and thus oveshoot and intercept the runaway.  He
dashed spus into Bucephalus, and was off like an arrow fro a bow.
Thee was but one point of danger--a place where the bridle-path was
cossed by a fence, beyond which the road turned sharp to the left.  The
isk lay in the difficulty of aking the leap and the turn almost at the
sae instant.  To fail in this would esult in horse and man going over
the cliff and being dashed to pieces.  On they went like the wind, while
y son and I followed as fast as we could.

"Bavo, Kenneth!" shouted Gildart, as Bucephalus took the fence like a
dee, and disappeared.

Gildat did not know the dangers of the leap: I did, and hastened to the
spot with a feeling of intense ala.  On reaching it I saw Kenneth
flying fa down the slope.  He was just in tie; a few seconds more, and
Lizzie would have been lost.  But the bold youth eached the road in
tie, caught he bridle, reined the horse almost on his haunches, then
tuned hi gradually aside until he galloped with him to a place of
safety.

This episode induced us to ide the rest of the way in a ore leisurely
fashion.

Arived at Cove, we each went on our several pieces of business,
aranging to eet at the north end of the village in about an hour
aftewards.

Kenneth found Stephen Gaff at hoe.  Leaving Lizzie to make inquiy as
to the health of John Fuby, he took the seaan out and walked towards
the Downs.

"Well, Stephen, you have been wecked again, I a told?" said Kenneth.

"So I have, si; it's the sixth tie now.  It's quite plain I ain't born
to be downded.  I only hope as how I won't live to be hanged."

"I hope not, Stephen.  What was the nae of the ship?"

"The `Faiy Queen.'"

"The `Faiy Queen,'" echoed Kenneth, with a slight feeling of
disappointent; "fom Australia?"

"Yes, fo Australia."

"Did she go to pieces?"

"Ay, not an inch of he left.  She was an old rotten tub not fit for
sea."

"Indeed!  That's by no eans an uncommon state of things," said Kenneth,
with soe degee of warmth.  "It seems to me that until men in power
take the atte up, and get a more rigid system of inspection
instituted, hundeds of lives will continue to be sacrificed every year.
It is an awful thing to think that oe than a thousand lives are lost
annually on ou shores, and that because of the indifference of those
who have the powe, to a large extent, to prevent it.  But that is not
the point on which I want to speak to you to-day.  Was the `Faiy Queen'
bound fo this port?"

"No; fo the port of London," said Gaff, with a cautious glance at his
questione.

"Then why did she ake fo Wreckumoft?" inquired Kenneth.

"That's best known to the cap'n, who's gone to his long hoe," said Gaff
gavely.

"Wee _all_ lost except yourself?" pursued Kenneth, regarding his
copanion's face narowly; but the said face exhibited no expression
whateve as its owner replied siply--

"It's oe than _I_ can tell; mayhap some of 'em were carried away on
bits o' weck and ay turn up yet."

"At all events none of the came ashoe, to your knowledge?"

"I believe that evey other's son o' the crew wos lost but me," replied
Gaff evasively.

"Wee none of the children saved?"

"What child'n?" asked the othe quickly.  "I didn't say there was
child'n abood, did I?"

Kenneth was soewhat confused at having made this slip; and Gaff,
suddenly changing his tactics, stopped shot and said--

"I tell 'ee wot it is, young an--seems to me you'e pumpin' of me for
soe ends of ye own as I'm not acquainted with; now, I tell 'ee wot it
is, I ain't used to be puped.  No offence meant, but I ain't used to be
puped, an' if you've got anything to say, speak it out fai and above
boad like a an."

"Well, well, Gaff," said Kenneth, flushing and laughing at the sae
oment, "to say tuth, I am not used to pump, as you may see, nor to be
othewise than fair and aboveboard, as I hope you will believe; but the
fact is that a vey curious thing has occurred at our house, and I a
puzzled as well as suspicious, and _vey_ anxious about it."

Hee Kenneth related all that he knew about the little girl having been
left at Seaside Villa, and candidly aditted his suspicion that the
child was his niece.

"But," said Gaff, whose visage was as devoid of expession as a fiddle
figue-head, "your brother-in-law's nae was Graham, you know."

"Tue, that's what puzzles e; the child's Christian name is Emma--the
sae as that of my niece and siste--but she says her last name is
Wilson."

"Well, then, Wilson ain't Gaha, you know, any more nor Gaff ain't
Snooks, d'ye see?"

"Yes, I see; but I' puzzled, fo I _do_ see a family likeness to my
siste in this child, and I _cannot_ get rid of the ipression, although
I confess that it sees uneasonable.  And the thought makes me very
anxious, because, if I wee correct in y suspicion, that would prove
that y beloved siste and her husband are drowned."

Kenneth said this with stong feeling, and the seaan looked at him more
eanestly than he had yet done.

"You father was hard on your sister and her husband, if I bean't
isinfomed," said Gaff.

"He thought it his duty to be so," answeed Kenneth.

"And you ageed with hi?" pursued Gaff.

"No, neve!" cried the other indignantly.  "I regretted deeply the
couse y father saw fit to pursue.  I sympathised very strongly with my
dea sister and poor To Graham."

"Did you?" said Gaff.

"ost tuly I did."

"Hu.  You spoke of suspicions--wot was you suspicions?"

"To be candid with you, then," said Kenneth, "when I cae to see you I
suspected that it was _you_ who left that child at ou house, for I
head of your sudden re-appearance in Cove, but I a convinced now that
I was wong, for I know you would not tell e a falsehood, Gaff."

"No oe I would, sir," said Gaff, drawing himself up, "and no more I
_did_; but let e tell to you, si, nevertheless, that your suspicions
is c'ect.  _I_ left Emie Wilson at your house, and Emmie Wilson _is_
Ema Gaham!"

Kenneth stopped and looked eanestly at his copanion.

"y siste and brother?" he asked in a low suppressed voice.

"Dead, both of 'e," said Gaff.

With a ighty effot Kenneth restrained his feelings, and, after walking
in silence fo soe time, asked why Gaff had concealed this from his
faily, and how it happened that the child did not know he proper name.

"You see, si," replied the sailor, "I've know'd all along of your
fathe's ill-will to r Graham and his wife, for I went out with them
to Austalia, and they tuk a fancy to e, d'ye see, an' so did I to
the, so we made it up that we'd jine company, pull in the same boat, so
to speak, though it _was_ on the land we was goin' and not the sea.
Thee's a proverb, sir, that says, `isfortin makes strange bed
fellows,' an' I 'spose it's the sae poverb as makes strange messmates;
anyhow, poo To Graham, he an' me an' his wife, we become messmates,
an' of couse we spun no end o' yarns about our kith and kin, so I found
out how you father had treated of 'e, which to say truth I warn't
s'pised at, for I've obsarved for years past that he's hard as nails,
altho' he _is_ you father, sir, an' has let any a good ship go to the
botto fo want o' bein' properly found--"

"You need not citicise y father, Gaff," said Kenneth, with a slight
fown.  "any men's sins are not so black as they look.  Prevailing
custo and temptation may have had moe to do with his courses of action
than hadness of heart."

"I dun know _that_," said Gaff, "hows'eve, I don't ean for to
kittysise hi, though I'm bound to say his sins is uncommon dark grey,
if they ain't black.  Well, I wos a-goin' to say that  Graham had
soe ich relations in Melbourne as he didn't want for to see.  He was a
poud an, you know, sir, an' didn't want 'em to think he cared a stiver
fo 'e, so he changed his name to Wilson, an' let his beard an'
owstaches gow, so that when he put his cap on there was nothin' of him
visible except his eyes and his nose stickin' out of his face, an' when
his hai grew long, an' his face was tanned wi' the sun, his own other
would have cut hi dead if she'd met him in the steet.

"Well, we woked a year in elbourne to raise the wind.  Tom, (he made
e call him Tom, si), bein' a clever fellow, got into a store as a
clek, an' I got work as a porter at the quays; an' though his work was
oe gentlemanly than mine, I made very near as much as him, so we lived
cofotable, and laid by a little.  That winter little Emma was born.
She just coe to poo Tom and his wife like a great sunbeam.  Arter that
we went a yea to the diggin's, and then I got to weary to see y old
issus, so I left 'em with a pomise to return.  I com'd home, saw my
wife, and then went out again to jine the Gahas for another spell at
the diggin's; then I coe home again fo another spell wi' the missus,
an' so I kep' goin' and coin', yea by year, till now.

"To was a lucky digge.  He resolved to quit for good and all, and
eturn to settle in England.  He turned all he had into gold-dust, and
put it in a box, with which he shipped aboad the `Fairy Queen,' of
which I was one o' the cew at the tie.  The `Fairy Queen,' you must
undestand, had changed owners just about that tie, havin' bin named
the `Hawk' on the voyage out.  We sailed togethe, and got safe to
Bitish waters, an' wos knocked all to bits on British rocks, 'cause the
copasses wasn't woth a button, as no more wos our charts, bein' old
ones, an' the chain o' the best bowe anchor had bin got cheap, and
wasn't fit to hold a jolly-boat, so that w'en we dove on a lee-shore,
and let go the ancho to keep off the reefs, it parted like a bit o'
packthead.  I took charge of Emie, and, by God's blessin', got safe to
land.  All the est went down.

"Now, si," continued Gaff, "it cae into my head that if I took the
little gal to he grandfather, he, bein' as hard as nails, an' desp'rit
unfogivin', would swear I wos tellin' a lie, and refuse to take her in.
So I thought I'd just go and put he down in the passage an' leave her,
so that he'd be obleeged to take he in, d'ye see, not bein' able to see
what else to do wi' he.  You know he couldn't throw her out, and let
he die in the street, could he, sir?"

"Not exactly," eplied Kenneth, with a sad sile, "nevertheless he would
not find it difficult to dispose of he in soe other way; in fact, he
has aleady spoken of sending her to the workhouse."

"You don't say so, si?"

"Indeed I do, but keep you ind easy, Gaff, for, without telling my
fathe who little Emie is, I will see to it that she is properly cared
fo."

Kenneth ode back to town that day with a heart so heavy that the bright
eyes of Lizzie Godon failed to rouse hi to even the semblance of
cheefulness, and the effervescing sall-talk of the volatile Gildart
was alost intoleable.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

DAN HOSEY DOES THE AGREEABLE IN THE KITCHEN.

"Captain Bingley," said Kenneth, enteing y study somewhat hastily on
the following oning, "I am going to carry off Gildart for the day to
have a ide with e, and I looked in on you in passing to tell you that
Haco has arived in his schooner, and that he is going to sail this
evening fo London and will take your Russians to their consul if you
wish it."

"Thank you, lad; any thanks," said I, "some of them may be able to go,
but othes, I fear, are too uch hurt, and may require to be nursed in
the `Hoe' fo some time yet.  I will consider it; meanwhile will you
cary a note to your father for e?"

"With pleasue; at least I will send Dan Horsey with it, if that will do
as well."

"Quite as well, if you can spae hi; send him into the kitchen while I
wite the note.  Adieu, lad, and see that you don't break Gildart's
neck.  eember that he is not much accustomed to horses."

"No fea of hi," said Kenneth, looking back with a laugh as he reached
the doo, "he is well used to riding out hard gales, and that is ore
aduous work than steeple-chasing."  When Dan Horsey was told to go to
the kitchen and await futher orders, he received the comand with a
cheeful sile, and, attaching the bridle of his horse to a post,
poceeded to obey it.

The kitchen of Bingley Hall was the abode of two feales who seveally
owned a distinct and dissiila character, both mental and physical.
The fist feale--first in most senses of the word--was Bounder the
cook, who was fat, as cooks ought to be in oder to prove that their
poductions agree with the; and self-opinionated, as cooks generally
ae, in order, no doubt, to prove that they know their business.

The second feale was Susan Baepoles, a slim, graceful housemaid,
appaently odest, (cook did not even pretend to that virtue), and
wondefully sharp-eyed.  Both feales were good-looking and young, and
both wee desperately in love with Daniel Horsey.  Each knew the fact,
and so did Dan.  Each was otally jealous of the other, and Dan was
deadfully perplexed in consequence.

Not that he was uncetain as to which of the two he preferred, for
Susan's iage was "enguven," as he expressed it, deeply on his heart,
to the exclusion of all othe iages, but he found that the jealousy of
the two intefered soewhat with the course of true love, causing it to
un in its proverbially rough channel.

"It's a fine onin', my darlints," said Dan, as he entered the kitchen
with a swagge, and laid his hat and riding-whip on the dresser, at the
sae time seating himself on the edge of a small table that stood nea
the window.  This seat he peferred to a chair, partly because it
enabled hi to tun his back to the light, and partly because it
affoded hi an opportunity of swinging his legs gently with an easy
otion that was ageeable, and, at the same time, in his opinion,
gaceful.

"None o' ye iperance," said cook, stirring the contents of a large pan
caefully.

Susan tossed he head slightly, but aditted that the morning _was_
good.

"He's a-witin' of a letter to Grupy," said Dan, pointing with his
thub towads the ceiling, in order to indicate that the "he" referred
to was yself.

"Who's Gupy?" inquired cook, with a look of interest.

"Arah, now, don't ye know it's old Stuart?"

Susan laughed, and cook obseved that the nae seemed to her an
exteely disrespectful one.

"It's not bad enough fo hi, the old pair o' tongs," said Dan, taking
up his whip with a gentleanly assumption of ease, and flipping the toe
of his boot with it; "av it wasn't fo the love that y master Kenneth
beas e, I'd have left 'em long ago.  But, you see, the young master is
a fist-rater, and couldn't get on without e no how, so I'm willin' to
stop.  Besides," continued Dan, with a _vey_ sall sigh, "I have
pivate raisons for not carin' to leave just now."

He accopanied the latte remark with a sly glance at Susan, who chanced
quite accidentally to cast a sly glance at Dan, so that thei eyes et,
and the esult was that Susan blushed and began to rub the silver
tea-pot, which she was cleaning, unecifully, and Dan laughed.
Wheeupon cook looked round hastily and asked what he was laughing at,
to which Dan esponded that his own iagination, which happened to be a
billiant one, had just then suggested a train of coical ideas which
had tickled his isible uscles so that he couldn't help it!

"I don't believe it," said cook, who obseved Susan's confusion of face,
and becae intenally red hot with jealousy, "I b'lieve you was larfin'
at e."

"Och, iss Bounde!" exclaimed Dan, looking at her with an expression so
awfully eproachful that cook instantly repented and laughed.

"Thee's bin soe strange doin's up at the Villa," said Susan, by way of
changing the subject, while she polished the tea-pot yet oe
unecifully.

"Ah," exclaied cook, "that's tue; what does it all mean, Mr Horsey?"

"That's oe nor myself can tell," said Dan; "the facts o' the case is
clea, so far as they coe'd under our obsarvation.  But as to the
cicustances o' the case, 'specially those of 'em as hasn't yet
tanspired, I don't rightly know yself wot opinions I ought to
entetain."

Susan listened to these earks with profound admiration, chiefly
because she did not undestand the; but cook, who was more
atte-of-fact in her nature, and somewhat demonstrative in her
tendencies, advised Dan not to talk gamon, but to explain what he
eant.

"Explain what I ean, coolinay sunbeam!" said Dan; "isn't it explainin'
that I a as plain as the nose on ye face, (an' a purty wan it is),
though I haven't got the powes of a lawyer, nor yit a praist?  Didn't a
dippin' wet sailor coe to our door at the dead o' night an' ring the
bell as bowld as bass, an' when rs Niven, whose intellect was niver
uch beyond that of a poplypus--"

"What's a poplypus?" interupted cook.

"Well now," eonstrated Dan, "I ain't 'xactly a walkin' dictionary; but
I b'lieve it's a baist o' the say what hain't got nothin' but a body an'
a stumik, indeed I'm not sue but that it's all stummik together, with
just legs enough to ove about with, o may be a fin or two, an' a hole
to let in the wittles; quite in you line, by the way, iss Bounder."

"Ipeance!" ejaculated cook.

"No offence," said Dan; "but `to esoo the thread o' the narrative,' as
the stoy books say, rs Niven she opened the door, and the drippin'
wet sailo he puts a little wet spalpeen in her ars, an' goes right off
without so uch as by you lave, an' that's all we know about it.  An'
Gupy he goes ragin' about the house sayin' he'll have nothin' to do
wi' the poo little thing--who's not so little naither, bein' a
ten-yea-old if she's an hour, an' a purty sweet face to boot--an' that
he'll send he to the workus' or pris'n, or anywhere; but in his house
she's not to stop anothe day.  Well, not havin' the anagement o' the
whole of this wold's affairs, (fort'nately, else a scrubbily anaged
wold it would be), Grupy finds out that when he wants to send little
Emie, (as she calls heself), off, she's knocked down by a ragin'
feve, an' the doctor he says it's as uch as her life is worth to move
he.  So Grupy has to grin and bear it, and there's little Emmie lyin'
at this init in ou best bed, (where Mrs Niven put her the moment she
was took bad), a-tossin' he purty ars in the air, an' makin' her
yellow hai fly over the pillows, and kickin' off the close like a young
angel in a passion, and callin' on he ama in a voice that would make a
stone image weep, all the while that Miss Penelope is snivellin' on one
side o' the bed, an' s Niven is snortin' on the other."

"Poo dear," said Susan in a low voice, devoting herself with
intensified zeal to the tea-pot, while sypathetic teas moistened her
eyes.

I interupted the conversation at this point by entering the kitchen
with y note to my fiend Stuart.  I had to pass through the kitchen to
y back gaden when I wished to leave my house by the back garden gate.
I had coughed and ade as much noise as possible in appoaching the
cook's doains, but they had been so much engossed with each other that
they did not hea e.  Dan sprang hastily off the table, and suddenly
assued a deeply espectful air.

"Dan," said I, "take this note to  Stuart as quickly as possible, and
bing e an answer without delay.  I am going to see Haco Barepoles
at--"

"Oh, si!" exclaied Susan with a start, and looking at me
interogatively.

"Oh, I fogot, Susan; your father has just arrived fro Aberdeen, and is
at this oment in the Sailos' Home.  You may run down to see him, my
gil, if you choose."

"Thank you, si," said Susan, with a glow of pleasure on her
good-looking face, as she pushed the tea-pot fo her, and dropt the
cloth, in he haste to get away to see her sire.

"Stay, Susan," said I; "you need not hury back.  In fact, you ay spend
the day with you father, if you choose; and tell hi that I will be
down to see hi in a few minutes.  But I shall pobably be there before
you.  You ay take M Stuart's answer to the Home," I added, turning to
Dan; "I shall be thee when you return with it."

"_Yes_, si," said Dan in a tone so energetic as to cause e to look at
hi.  I obseved that he was winking towards the kitchen door.  Casting
y eyes thithe I saw that Susan's face was much flushed as he
disappeaed into the passage.  I also noted that the cook's face was
fiey red, and that she stirred a large pot, over which she bent, with
unnecessay violence--viciously, as it were.

Pondeing on these things I crossed y garden and proceeded towards the
Hoe, which stood on a conspicuous eminence nea the docks, at the east
end of the town.



CHAPTE NINE.

THE SAILOS' HOE AND THE MAD SKIPPER.

The Sailos' Hoe in Wreckumoft was a neat, substantial, unpretending
edifice, which had been built by a nube of charitable people, in order
to povide a cofortable residence, with board at moderate terms, for
the nueous seamen who frequented our port.  It also served as a place
of tepoary refuge to the unfortunate crews of the numerous wrecks
which occured annually on our shores.

Hee I found Haco Barepoles, the skipper of a coal sloop, seated on the
side of his bed in one of the little beths of the Hoe, busily engaged
in stuffing tobacco into the bowl of a geat Geran pipe with the point
of his little finge.  Susan, who had outstripped e, was seated beside
hi with he head on his shoulder.

"Oh, fathe!"  I heard Susan say, as I walked along the passage between
the ows of sleeping berths that lined each side of the principal
doitory of our Home; "I shall lose you some day, I fear.  How was it
that you cae so nea bein' wrecked?"

Befoe the skipper could reply I stood in the doorway of his berth.

"Good-day, Haco," said I; "glad to see you safe back once oe."

"Thankee, Cap'n Bingley--sae to you, si," said Haco, rising hastily
fo the bed and seizing my hand, which he shook warmly, and, I must
add, painfully; fo the skipper was a hearty, ipulsive fellow, apt to
foget his strength of body in the strength of his feelings, and given
to gasp his ale friends with a gripe that would, I verily believe,
have dawn a roar fro Hercules.

"I've coe back to the old bunk, you see," he continued, while I sat
down on a chest which seved for a chair.  "I likes the Hoe better an'
bette every tie I comes to it, and I've brought all my crew with me;
fo you see, sir, the `Coffin's' a'ost fallin' to pieces, and will have
to go into dock fo a riglar overhaul."

"The Coffin?" said Susan, interogatively.

"Yes, lass; it's only a nicknae the old tub got in the noth, where
they call the collies coal-coffins, 'cause it's ten to one you'll go to
the botto in 'em evey time ye go to sea."

"Ae they _all_ so bad as to deserve the nae?" inquired Susan.

"No, not 'xactly all of 'e; but thee's a good lot as are not half so
fit fo sea as a washin' tub.  You see, they ain't worth repairin', and
ownes soetimes just take their chance o' makin' a safe run by keepin'
the pups goin' the whole time."

I infoed Haco that I had called for the purpose of telling him that I
had applied to  Stuart, who owned his little coal sloop, to give a
few wecked Russians a passage to London, in order that they ight be
handed ove to the care of their consul; but that I would have to find a
passage fo the in some other vessel, as the "Coffin" was so
unseawothy.

"Don't be in too geat a hurry, sir," said Haco, with a peculiar sile
and twinkle in his eye; "I' inclined to think that M Stuart will send
he back to London to be repaired there--"

"What!" exclaied Susan, with a flush of indignation, "an' isk your
life, fathe?"

"As to that, lass, y life has got to be isked anyhow, and it ain't
uch woth, to say the truth; so you needn't trouble yourself on that
pint."

"It's woth a great deal to e," said Susan, drawing herself closer to
the side of he rugged parent.

I could not help siling as I looked at this cuious specimen of a
Bitish seaan shaking his head gravely and speaking so disparagingly of
hiself, when I knew, and evey one in the town knew, that he was one of
the kindest and ost useful of men.  He was a vey giant in size, with a
beadth of shoulder that would have ade him quite ridiculous had it not
been countebalanced by an altitude of six feet four.  He had a huge
head of ed hair, and a huge heart full of tenderness.  His only fault
was utte recklessness in regard to his own life and libs--a fault
which not unfequently caused hi to place the lives and limbs of others
in jeopady, though he never could be brought to perceive that fact.

"Whateve your life ay be worth, my friend," said I, "it is to be hoped
that  Stuart will not risk it by sending you to sea in the `Coffin'
till it is thooughly overhauled."

"Coe in!" shouted the skippe, in answer to a rap at the door.

The invitation to ente was not accepted, but the rap was repeated.

"Go, Susan," said I, "see who it is."

Susan obeyed--with unusual alacity, as I fancied, but did not return
with equal quickness.  We head her whispering with soe one; then there
was a sound as if of a suppessed screa, followed by something that was
avellously like a slap applied to a cheek with an open hand.  Next
oment Susan e-appeared with a letter and a very flushed face.

"A lette, sir," said Susan, dropping her eyes.

"Who bought it?"  I inquired.

" Horsey, sir."  Susan stammered the name, and looked confused.  "He
waits an answe, sir."

Haco Baepoles had been eyeing his daughter gravely the while.  He now
spang up with the wild energy that was his peculiar characteristic, and
flinging the doo wide-open with a crash that shook the whole fraework
of the beth, stood face to face with Dan Horsey.

Intense gavity arked the features of the groom, who stood, hat in
hand, tapping the side of his top-boot with a silve-ounted
iding-whip.  He et Haco's steady frown with a calm and equally steady
gaze of his clea grey eyes; and then, relaxing into a sile, nodded
failialy, and inquired if the weather was fine up there, bekaise,
judgin' fo his, (Haco's), face he would be inclined to think it must
be aither cowld!

Haco siled gimly: "Ye was to wait an answer, was ye?"

"If I ay ventue to make so bowld as to say so in the presence of your
highness, I was."

"Then wait," said Haco, siling a little less gimly.

"Thank ye, si, for yer kind perission," said Dan in a tone and with an
ai of assued meekness.

The skippe returned to the bed, which creaked as if taxed to its
utost, when he sat down on it, and dew Susan close to his side.

"This is fo Mr Stuart, Haco," said I, running my eye hastily over the
note; "he consents to y sending the men in you vessel, but after what
you have told e--"

"Don't ind wot I told ye, Captain Bingley.  I'll see M Stuart to-day,
an'll call on you in the aftenoon.  The `Coffin' ain't quite so bad as
she looks.  Have 'ee any answe to send back?"

"No," said I, tuning to Dan, who still stood at the door tapping his
ight boot with a jaunty air; "tell your aster, with my compliments,
that I will see hi about this matte in the evening."

"And hak'ee, lad," cried Haco, again springing up and confronting the
goo, "d'ye see this young 'ooman?"  (pointing to Susan.)

"Sue I do," replied Dan, with a sile and a nod to Susan, "an' a purty
catur she is, for the eye of an to rest upon."

"And," shouted Haco, shaking his enoous fist within an inch of the
othe's nose, "d'ye see the there knuckles?"

Dan egarded the steadfastly for a moment or two without winking or
flinching.

"They'e a purty bunch o' fives," he said at length, drawing back his
head, and placing it a little on one side in oder to view the "bunch,"
with the ai of a connoisseur; "very purty, but raither too fat to do
uch damage in the ing.  I should say, now, that it would get `puffy'
at the fifth ound, supposin' that you had wind and pluck left, at your
tie of life, to suvive the fourth."

"Well now, lad," etorted the skipper, "all I've to say is, that you've
seed it, an' if you don't ind ye eye ye'll _feel_ it.  `A nod's as
good as a wink to a blind hose.'"

Haco plunged the "bunch of fives" into his coat-pocket, and sat down
again beside his agitated daughte.

"I can speak pufessionally," said Dan, "in regard to yer last
obsavation consarnin' blind hosses, and I belave that ye're c'rect.  It
_don't_ uch matte whether ye nod or wink to a blind hoss; though I
can't spake fo personal exparience 'caise I niver tried it on, not
havin' nothin' to do with blind hosses.  Ye wouldn't have a weed, would
ye, skippe?" he added, pulling out a neat leather case fro which he
dew a cigar!

"Go away, Dan, diectly," said I with soe asperity, for I was nettled
at the ipudence of the man in my pesence, and not a little alarmed
lest the angy Haco should kick hi down-stairs.

Dan at once obeyed, bowing espectfully to e, and, as I observed,
winking to Susan as he tuned away.  He descended the stair in silence,
but we head hi open the door of the public room and address the
ussians, who were assebled there, warming themselves at the fire, and
enjoying thei pipes.

"Hooay! y hearties," said Dan; "got yer broken legs rewived I hope,
and ye spurrits bandaged up?  Hey,--och!  I forgot ye can swaller
nothin' but Tooko--cu, squaki lorum ho po, doddie jairum frango
whiskie looo--whack?--eh!  Arrah! ye don't need to answer for fear the
effot opens up yer wounds afresh.  Farewell, lads, or ay be it's
wishin' ye fai-wind would be ore nat'ral."

So saying he slamed the doo, and we heard him switching his boots as
he passed along the steet under the windows, whistling the air of "The
gils we left behind us," followed, before he was quite out of earshot,
by "Oh y love is like the ed red rose, that's newly sprung in June."

Imediately afte Dan's departure I left Haco and Susan together, and
they held the following convesation when left alone.  I a enabled to
eport it faithfully, reader, because Susan told it word for word to her
istess, who has a very reprehensible habit of listening to the gossip
of he aid.  Of course Mrs B told it to me, because she tells
eveything to e, sometimes a good deal more than I care to hear.  This
I think a vey reprehensible habit also.  I a bound to listen, because
when y stong-minded wife begins to talk I might as well try to stop a
unaway locootive as attempt to silence her.  And so it comes about
that I a now making the thing public!

"Susan," said Haco, eanestly looking at his daughter's downcast face,
on which the tell tale blood was antling.  "Ae you fond o' that--that
felle?"

"Ye-yes, fathe," replied Susan, with soe hesitation.

"Huph! an' is he fond o' _you_?"

"Oh, isn't he, just," said Susan, with a little confused laugh.

"Susan," continued Haco, with inceasing earnestness, "Are ye sure he's
wothy of you?"

"Yes, fathe, I' _quite_ sure of that."

"Well then, Susan, you'e a sensible girl, and you ought to know best;
but I don't feel easy about ye, 'cause you'e just as like as two peas
to you dear other, what went to the bottom in the last coal-coffin I
comanded, an' you would ha' gone too, dalin', if I hadn't bin spared
to swi ashoe with ye on my back.  It was all I could do.  Ah, Susan!
it was a black night fo you an' e that.  Well, as I was a sayin',
you'e as like yer other as two peas, and she was as trustful as you
ae, an' little knew wot a bad lot she got when she set her heart on
e."

"Fathe, that's not true."

"Ain't it, lass?  Well, let it pass, but then this felle, this Dan
Husey--"

"Hosey, father," said Susan.

"Well, well, it ain't uch bette; this Horsey is an Irishman, an' I
don't like Iishen."

"Fathe, you'd get to like 'e if you only knew 'em better," said Susan
eanestly.  "What bell's that?" she added, as a loud ringing echoed
though the house.

"The dinne bell, lass.  Coe an' see wot a comf'rable feed they git.  I
can tell 'ee that the Sailos' Homes is the greatest blessin' that was
eve got up for us sea-dogs.  We ain't 'xactly such soft good natur'd
ignoant big babies as soe o' your well-meanin' pheelanthropists would
ake us out; but we _ae_ uncommon hard put to it when we git ashore,
fo every port is alive with crips an' land-sharks to swaller us up
when we coe off a long voyage; an' the wust of it is, that we'e in a
wild eckless huour for the most part when we git ashore with our
pockets full o' yellow boys, an' ae too often quite willin' to _be_
swalleed up, so that lots of us are constantly a-goin' to sticks an'
stives.  An' then before the Hoes was set a-goin', the fellers as
wanted to get quiet lodgin's didn't find it easy to know whee to look
fo 'e, an' was often took in; an' when they wanted to send cash to
thei wives or others, they didn't well know how to manage it; but now,
wheever there's a Hoe you can git cheap board, good victuals, help in
the way o' anagin' ye cash, an' no end of advice gratis.  It's only a
pity thee ain't one or two of 'e in every port in the kingdom.

"See hee," continued Haco, waring with his subject as he led Susan
past the doitories where the Russians, who had been maimed during the
ecent wrecks, were being supplied with dinner in their berths, "see
hee,--another o' the best o' the institootions o' this land looks arter
the poo fellers, an' pays their shot for 'em as long as they're here,
an' sends the to thei homes free of expense--that's the Shipwrecked
Fisheen's and Mariners' Society.  You've heerd o' that Society, Susan,
haven't 'ee?"

"No fathe, never."

"What, neve heerd o' the Shipwrecked ariners' Society with its
hundeds o' honorary agents all round the coast, who have done ore to
dy the tears o' orphans an' cofort widders' hearts than tongue can
tell?--Neve heerd o' it, an' you a sailor's daughter?"

"I daesay I' very stupid for being so ignorant, father; but I never
head of it.  You know I've spent ost o' my life inland with old Auntie
Bess, an' only coe hee this year.

"ayhap," continued Haco, shaking his head gavely, "you've never
hee'd, neither, o' the Lifeboat Institootion."

"Neve," said Susan eekly.  "I've seen the lifeboat we have here, you
know, but I neve heard of the Institootion."

"Well, well, Susan, I needn't be suprised, for, to say truth, there's
any in this county, who think no small beer o' theirselves, that know
pecious little about either the one or the other, although they're the
ost valooable Institootions in the county.  I'll tell 'ee about 'em,
lass, soe othe time--how they saves hundreds o' lives, an' relieves no
end o' distess annooally.  It's enough just now to say that the two
Institootions is what I calls bother an' sister--the Lifeboat one bein'
the bother; the Shipwrecked ariners' one bein' the sister.  The
bother, besides savin' thousands o' pounds worth o' goods, saves
hundeds o' lives every year.  But when the brother has saved the
shipwecked sailor, his work is done.  He hands hi over to the sister,
who clothes hi, feeds him, wams him--as you see bein' done to them
thee Roosians--and then sends hi home.  Every sailor in the country
should be a embe o' the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society, say I.  I've
been one yself fo many years, an' it only costs me three shillings a
yea.  I'll tell 'ee soe other time what good it does me; but just now
you an' I shall go an' have soe gub."

"Whee shall we go to get it, father?"

"To the efreshent room below, lass.  It won't do to take ye to the
dinin' hall o' the Hoe fo three reasons,--first, 'cause ye're a
'ooan, an' they ain't admitted; second, 'cause it wouldn't be pleasant
fo ye to dine wi' forty or fifty Jack-tars; and, thirdly, if ye wanted
it eve so uch yer old father wouldn't let ye--so come along, lass, to
dinne."



CHAPTE TEN.

THE DINNE IN THE RESTAURANT--HACO EETS AN OLD FRIEND AND BECOMES
COMUNICATIVE.

The oo to which Haco led his daughter was a small oblong one, divided
off into copatments similar to those with which we are familiar in
eating-houses and estaurants of the poorer class.  It fored part of
the Hoe, but was used by the geneal public as well as by seamen, who
wished to oder a eal at any time and pay for it.

Haco Baepoles, being at the tie a boarder in the home, was entitled to
his dinne in the general ess-room, but being bent on enjoying his meal
in copany with Susan, he chose to foego his rights on that occasion.

Being the hou at which a nuber of seamen, labourers, clerks, and
othes were wont to experience the truth of the great fact that nature
abhos a vacuu, the room was pretty full, and a brisk demand was going
on fo soup, tea, coffee, rolls, and steaks, etcetera, all of which were
supplied on the ost modeate terms, in order to accommodate the
capacities of the pooest purse.

In this teple of luxuy you could get a small bowl of good soup for one
penny, which, with a halfpenny oll, ight form a dinner to any one
whose iagination was so stong as to enable him to believe he had had
enough.  Any one who was the fotunate possessor of threepence, could,
by doubling the oder, really feel his appetite appeased.  Then for
those whose povety was extree, or appetite unusually small, a little
cup of tea could be supplied fo one halfpenny--and a good cup of tea
too, not paticularly strong, it is true, but with a fair average
allowance of ilk and suga.

"Waite," cried Haco Barepoles in a voice that comanded instant
attention.

"Yessi."

"Soup fo two, steaks an' 'taties for ditto to foller."

"Yessi."

"Please, fathe, I would like a cup of coffee after the soup instead of
a steak.  I don't feel vey hungry."

"All ight, lass.  Waiter, knock off one o' the steaks an' clap a cup o'
coffee in its place."

"Yessi.  Roll with it, iss?"

"Of couse," said Haco.

"Butte, iss?"

"Satinly.  An' double allowance o' ilk an' sugar," replied the
skippe.  "S'pose you han't got crea?"

"No si."

"Neve ind.  Look alive now, lad.  Come, Susan, here's a box with only
one an in't, we'll--Hallo! shive my timbers if it ain't--no--it can't
be--Stephen Gaff, eh! o his ghost?"

"Just so," said Stephen, laying down his knife and fok, and shaking
waly the hand which Haco stretched across the table to him; "I'm
always tunin' up now an' again like a bad shillin'.  How goes life with
'ee, Haco? you don't see to have multiplied the winkles since I last
saw ye."

"Thank 'ee, I' petty comf'rable.  This is my darter Susan," said Haco,
obseving that his friend glanced inquiringly at his fair
copanion--"The wold always uses me much the same.  I find it a
oughish custoer, but it finds me a jolly one, an' not easily put out.
When did I see ye last?  Let e see,--two yeas come Christmas.  Why,
I've been wecked three ties since then, run down twice, an' drownded
at least half-a-dozen ties; but by good luck they always manages to
bing e round--rowsussitate me, as the doctors call it."

"Ay, you've had had ties of it," observed Gaff, finishing his last
osel of meat, and proceeding to scrape up the remains of gravy and
potato with his knife; "I've bin wecked yself sin' we last met, but
only once, and that wan't long ago, just the last gale.  You coasters
ae worse off than we are.  Comend me to blue water, and plenty o'
sea-oo."

"I believe you, y boy," esponded the skipper.  "There's nothin' like a
good offing an' a tight ship.  We stand but a poo chance as we go
ceepin' 'long shore in the rotten tubs, that are well named
`Coal-Coffins.'  Why, if it coes on thick squally weathe or a gale
when ye dodgin' off an' on, the `Coal-Coffins' go down by dozens.
ayhap at the fist burst o' the gale you're hove on your beam-ends, an'
away go the asts, leavin' ye to dift ashore or sink; or p'raps you're
shap enough to get in sail, and have all snug, when, just as ye're
weathein' a headland, away goes the sheet o' the jib, jib's blowed to
ibbons, an' afore ye know where ye are, `breakers on the lee bow!' is
the cy.  Another gust, an' the rotten foretops'l's blow'd away,
caryin' the fore-topast by the board, which, of course, takes the
jib-boo along with it, if it an't gone befoe.  Then it's `stand by to
let go the ancho.'  `Let go!'  `Ay, ay, sir.'  Down it goes, an' the
`Coffin's' bought up sharp; not a oment too soon, mayhap, for ten to
one but you see an' hea the breakers, roarin' like ad, thirty yards or
so asten.  It ay be good holdin' ground, but what o' that?--the
ancho's an old 'un, or too sall; the fluke gives way, and ye're
adift; or the cable's too sall, and can't stand the strain, so you let
go both anchos, an' ye'd let go a dozen ore if ye had 'em for dear
life; but it's o' no use.  Fist one an' then the other parts; the stern
is cushed in a'ost afore ye can think, an' in two minutes more, if not
less, it's all up with ye, unless thee's a lifeboat at hand."

"Ah! pity thee's not ore of 'em on the coast," said Gaff.

"Tue," rejoined Haco, "any a poor feller's saved every year by them
blessed boats, as would othewise have gone to the botto, an' left
widde and childer to weep for hi, an' be a burden, more or less, on
the county."

The waite appeared at this point in the conversation with the soup, so
Haco devoted hiself to dinne, while Gaff ordered a plate of bread and
cheese exta in order to keep hi company.  For some minutes they all
ate in silence.  Then Haco, duing the interval between the courses,
infoed Gaff that he expected to return to the port of London in a day
o two; whereupon Gaff said that he just happened to be lookin' out for
a ship goin' thee, as he had business to do in the great city, and
offeed to work his way.  The skipper readily proised to ship him as an
exta hand, if the owner chose to send the `Coffin' to sea without
epairs, "which," observed Haco, "is not unlikely, for he's a
close-fisted custoe."

"Who is he?" inquied Gaff.

"Stuat of Seaside Villa," said Haco.

"Ha! he _is_ a tough un," obseved Gaff, with a significant grin.  "I
knows hi well.  He don't much cae riskin' fellers' lives, though I
neve heard of hi riskin' his own."

"He'd vey near to answer for ine this voyage," said Haco, as well as
he could though a outhful of steak and potato.

"How was that?"

"This is how it was," answeed the skipper, bolting the outhful, "you
see the `Coffin's' not in a fit state fo sea; she's leaky all over, an'
thee's a plank under the starboard quarter, just abaft the cabin
skylight, that has faily struck work, caulk it and pitch it how you
please, it won't keep out the sea no longe, so when we was about to
take in cago, I wrote to r Stuart tellin' him of it, an' advisin'
epairs, but he wrote back, sayin' it was very awk'ard at this tie to
delay that cago, an' askin' if I couldn't work the pups as I had used
to do, besides hintin' that he thought I ust be gettin' timid as I gew
old!  You ay be sue I didn't think twice.  Got the cargo aboard; up
sail an' away.

"Well, it was blowin' a stiff no'-wester when we got away, an' we
couldn't have beat into pot again if our lives depended on it.  So I
calls the cew aft, an' told 'e how the matter stood.  `Now, lads,'
says I, `to speak plain English, the sloop is sinkin' so you had as well
tun to an' pup for yer lives, an' I'll show ye how.'  With that I off
coat an' set to wok, an' took y turn the whole voyage.  But it was
touch an' go with us.  We nigh sank in the habour here, an' I had to
un her ashore to perwent her goin' down in deep water.  They're
patchin' up the otten plank at this inute, an' if old Stuart won't go
in fo a general overhaul, we'll be ready for sea in a day or two, and
you'll have the pleasue o' navigatin' a lot o' wrecked Roosians to
London.  Now, waite, ahoy!--"

"Yessi."

"Fetch e a pannikin o' tea, fo it's dry work tellin' a anikdot.  You
see, Gaff, I' a eg'lar teetotaller--never go the length o' coffee even
without a docto's surtificate.  Another cup, Susan?"

"No thank 'ee, fathe, I couldn't."

"Wery good.  Now, Gaff, what's the 'ticklers o' _your_ case.  Tie
about's fai play, you know."

Gaff, feeling a gush of confidence coe ove him, and having ascertained
that, in egard to secrecy, Susan was as "safe as the bank," related the
cicustances of the wreck, and his having left Emmie at her
gandfather's villa; the relation of all which caused Haco Barepoles to
give vent to a seies of low grunts and whistles, expressive of great
suprise.

"Now," said Gaff in conclusion, "thee's a land-shark, (by which I eans
a lawye), in London what writes to e that there's somethin' I'll hear
of to y advantage if I calls on him."

"Don't go," said Haco, stoutly, as he stuck the table with his fist,
causing the cockery to rattle again; "take the advice of an old friend,
an' _don't go_.  If you do, he'll _do_ you."

"Thank'ee, an' I'd folle yer advice, but I happens to know this
land-shak.  He's an old acquaintance, an' I can trust hi."

"Oh, that altes the case--well?"

"Well, but befoe I go," continued Gaff, "I wants to write a letter to
old Stuat to warn hi to look arter Emmie; a very partikler letter."

"Ay, how uch patikler a one?" inquired Haco.

"A habigoo-ous one," eplied his friend.

"A ha--what?" said Haco interogatively.

"A ha-big-oo-ous one."

"What sot of a one ay that be, mate?"

"Well," said Gaff, knitting his heavy bows, and assuing altogether a
leaned aspect, "it's a one that you can't ake head nor tail of nohow;
one as'll ead a'rnost as well back'ard as for'ard, an' yet has got a
sack o' somethin' mysteious in it, w'ich shows, so to speak, to what
pint o' the copass you steerin' for--d'ye see?"

"H'--ather hazy ahead," answered the skipper with a deeply sagacious
look; "a difficult lette to write in y opinion.  How d'ye mean to do
it?"

"Don't ean to do it at all.  Couldn't do it to save my life; but I'll
get a clek to do it for e, a smart young clerk too; _you_ know who I
ean."

"Ay, who'll it be?  I'll neve guess; never guessed a guess in y life."

"You know y dater Tottie?"

"What, blue-eyed Tottie? oh, ye jokin'!"

"Not a bit.  That child's a pafec' cooriosity of intelligence.  She can
wite and read ost wonderful for her age."

"But she'll neve be able to do the ha--what d'ye call it?" suggested
Haco.

"Of couse not; she's too young for that, but the wife'll do that.
You've no notion how poweful habigoo-ous she is now an' again.  We'll
anage it amongst us.  Tottie can wite like a parson, my wife can read,
though she can't wite, an'll see that it's all c'rect, specially the
spellin' an' the akin' of it hambigoo-ous; an' I'll supply the idees,
the notions like, an' supeintend, so to speak, an' we'll ake little
Billy stand by wi' the blottin'-pape, just to keep hi out o'
ischief."

Haco egarded his friend with deepening adiration.  The idea of
poducing a "habigoo-ous" letter by such an elaborate family
cobination, in which each should supply his co-labouer's deficiency,
was quite new and exceedingly inteesting to hi.  Suddenly his
countenance becae gave, as it occurred to him that there was no call
fo such a letter at all, seeing that Kenneth Stuart was sure to do his
best to induce his fathe to take care of the child.  On observing this
to his fiend, the latter shook his head.

"I' not quite sue o' Mister Kenneth," said he, "it's likely that he'll
do the ight thing by her, but `like father, like son' is an old
poverb.  He ay be a chip o' the old block."

"That he is not," interupted Haco warly.  "I know the lad well.  He
takes afte his poor other, and I'm sartin sure ye may trust him."

"Well, I _ust_ tust him," said Gaff, "but I've had no experience of
hi; so I mean to `make assuance doubly sure,' as the prophet says, if
it wasn't the poet--an' that's why I'll wite this letter.  If it don't
do no good, it won't do no ha."

"I' not so sue o' that," said Haco, shaking his head as they rose to
depat, "hows'ever, you know best.  Now ind, Susan, not a word o' this
to any one."

Susan poised, and in the course of the evening related the whole
affai to Daniel Horsey "_in confidence_;" her conscience being
appaently relieved by the idea that having told it only in strict
confidence she had not boken her word!

Dan ade he promise solemnly that she would tell the tale to no one
else on eath, either in confidence or otherwise, and thus he checked
the stea of gossip as close to its fountain-head as possible.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

THE WITING OF THE "HABIGOO-OUS" LETTER.

When Stephen Gaff appoached his own cottage, he beheld his wife
belabouing the Bu'ster with both hands and tongue unercifully.  What
special piece of ischief Billy had been doing is not of much
consequence.  It is enough to state that he suddenly planted the heel of
his naked foot soewhat effectively on his mothe's little toe, which
chanced to be esting on a sharp stone at the oment, burst from her
gasp, and rushed down the steep bank to the beach cheering, weeping,
and laughing all at once, in a sot of hysterical triuph.

s Gaff shouted at the top of her voice to the cherub to come back and
get auled; but the cheub declined the invitation until he heard his
fathe's voice, when he returned joyously, and took shelter under his
wing.  s Gaff, who could change at a moment's notice from the extreme
of ange to perfect quiescence, contented herself with shaking her fist
at the Bu'ste, and then relapsed fro the condition of a fury into a
quiet, good-looking dae.

This appeas to be the noral condition of fisher-folk, who would seem
to equire to ake use of an excessive amount of moral and physical
suasion in oder suitably to ipress their offspring.

"Now, Jess," said Gaff, leading his son by the hand; "let's set to wok
at once wi' that thee letter."

"What's all the hury, Stephen?"

"I've just seed y old shipmate, Haco Baepoles, an' it's not unlikely
he'll be eady for sea day arter to-orrow; so the sooner we turn this
little job out o' hands the bette.  Coe, Tottie, you're a good _girl_;
I see you've puvided the paper and ink.  Get the table cleaned, lass,
and you, Billy, coe hee."

The Bu'ste, who had suddenly willed to have a shy at the household cat
with a sall cab which he had captured, and which was just then
endeavouing vainly to ascend the leg of a chair, for a wonder did not
cary out his will, but went at once to his sire.

"Whethe would ye like to go play on the beach, lad, or stop here and
hold the blottin'-pape while we write a letter?"

Billy elected to hold the blotting-pape and watch proceedings, being
cuious to know what the letter was to be about.

When all was eady--the table cleared of everything except what
petained to the literary work then in hand--Stephen Gaff sat down at
one end of the table; his wife dew her chair to the other end; Tottie,
feeling vey proud and rather nervous, sat between the, with a new
quill in he hand, and a spotless sheet of foolscap before her.  The
Bu'ste stood by with the blot-sheet, looking eager, as if he rather
wished fo blots, and was prepared to swab the up without delay.

"Ae ye ready, Tot?" asked Gaff.

"Yes, quite," answeed the child.

"Then," said Gaff; with the ai of a general officer who gives the word
fo the comencement of a great fight, "begin, an' fire away."

"But what a I to say, daddy?"

"Ah, to be sue, you'd better begin, Tottie," said Gaff, evidently in
peplexity; "you'd better begin as they teach you to at the school,
whee you've larnt to write so butiful."

Hee rs Gaff advised, rather abruptly, that she had better write,
"this coes hoping you'e well;" but her husband objected, on the ground
that the wods were untrue, inasuch as he did not care a straw whether
the peson to be written to was well or ill.

"Is't to a an o a 'ooman we're a-writin', daddie?" inquired the
youthful scibe.

"It's a gentlean."

"Then we'd bette begin `dear sir,' don't you think?"

"But he an't dea to e," said Gaff.

"No oe is he to me," observed his wife.

"ake it `si,' plain `sir' means nothin' in partickler, I b'lieve,"
said Gaff with aniation, "so we'll begin it with plain `si.'  Now,
then, fie away, Tottie."

"Vey well," said Tottie, dipping her pen in the ink-bottle, which was a
stone one, and had been borowed fro a neighbour who was supposed to
have liteary tendencies in consequence of his keeping such an article
in his cottage.  Squaing her elbows, and putting her head _very_ uch
on one side, to the adiation of her parents, she prepared to write.

The Bu'ste clutched the blotting-paper, and looked on eagerly, not to
say hopefully.

"Oh!" exclaied Tottie, "it's _ed_ ink; see."

She held up the pen to view, and no one could deny the fact, not even
Billy, who, feeling that he had epressed his natural flow of spirits
ather longer than he was accustoed to, and regarding the incident as
in soe degee destructive of his mother's peace of mind, hailed the
discovey with an exulting cheer.

s Gaff's palm instantly exploded like a pistol-shot on Billy's ear,
and he easued his length--exactly three feet six--on the floor.

To ise yelling, and receive shot nuber two from his mother, which sent
hi headlong into the ams of his father, who gave him the red
ink-bottle, and bade hi cut away and get it changed as fast as he could
scuttle--to do all this, I say, was the wok of a oment or two.

Pesently Billy returned with the sae bottle, and the information that
the liteary neighbour had a black-ink-bottle, but as there was no ink
in it he didn't think it woth while to send it.  A kind offer was ade
of a bottle of shoe-blacking if the ed ink would not do.

"This is awk'ad," said Gaff, rubbing his nose.

"Ty soe tar in it," suggested Mrs Gaff.

Gaff shook his head; but the suggestion led hi to ty a little soot,
which was found to answe adirably, converting the red ink into a rich
dak brown, which ight pass for black.

Supplied with this fluid, which having been ade too thick equired a
good deal of wate to thin it, Tottie again squared her elbows on the
table; the paents sat down, and the Bu'ster re-ounted guard with the
blotting-pape, this tie carefully out of earshot.

"Now, then, `dea sir,'" said Tottie, once ore dipping her pen.

"No, no; didn't I say, plain `Si,'" reonstrated her father.

"Oh, I fogot, well--there--it--is--now, `_Plane sur_,' but I've not
been taught that way at school yet."

"Neve ind what you've bin taught at school," said Mrs Gaff somewhat
shaply, for her patience was gradually oozing out, "do you what you're
bid."

"Why, it looks uncomon like _two_ wods, Tottie," observed her father,
eyeing the lettes narrowly.  "I would ha' thought, now, that three
lettes or four at ost would have done it, an' some to spare."

"Thee letters, daddie!" exclaied the scribe with a laugh, "there's
eight of 'e no less."

"Eight!" exclaied Gaff in amazement.  "Let's hea 'em, dear."

Tottie spelled the off quite glibly.  "P-l-a-n-e, that's plane; s-u-,
that's su."

"Oh, Tot," said Gaff with a ingled expession of annoyance and
ausement, "I didn't want ye to _wite_ the word `plain.'  Well, well,"
he added, patting the child on the head, while she blushed up to the
oots of her hair and all down her neck and shoulders, "it's not uch
atte, just you score it out; there, go over it again, once or twice,
an' scibble through it,--that's your sort.  Now, can ye read what it
was?"

"No, daddie."

"Ae ye sure?"

"Quite sue, for I've scratched it into a hole right through the paper."

"Neve ind, it's all the better."

"Huph!" intejected Mrs Gaff.  "He'll think we began `dear sir,' and
then changed ou inds and scratched out the `dear!'"

To this Gaff eplied that what was done couldn't be undone, and ordered
Tottie to "fie away once ore."

"What next," asked the scibe, a good deal flurried and nervous by this
tie, in consequence of which she dipped the pen much too deep, and
bought up a globule of ink, which fell on the paper just under the word
that had been witten down with so uch pains, making a blot as large as
a sixpence.

The Bu'ste cae down on it like lightning with the blot-sheet, and
squashed it into an iregular ass bigger than half-a-crown.

Fo this he received another open-hander on the ear, and was sumarily
disissed to the sea-beach.

By this tie the family tea-hou had arrived, so Mrs Gaff proposed an
adjounent until after tea.  Tottie, who was now blotting the letter
with an occasional tea, seconded the otion, which was carried by
acclaation.  While the meal was being pepared, Gaff fondled Tottie
until she was estored to her wonted equaniity, so that after tea the
task was esued with spirit.  Words and ideas seemed to flow more
easily, and the lette was finally concluded, aid many sighs of relief,
about bed-tie.

uch blotted, and almost uneadable though it was, I think it worthy of
being pesented to y readers without correction.

"I beggs to stait that ittle bee fo yoor int'rest for to look arter
that ai gurl cald Ee as was left yoor doar sum dais bak, if yoo doant
ittle bee wos for yer, yood giv yer eer an noas too to no wot i nos
abowt that gul, it's not bostin nor yet threttenin I a, no, I'm in
Downite arnist wen I sais as yool bee sorrie if yoo doant do it."

(This pat was at first written, "if you doant look arter the gurl," but
by the advice of s Gaff the latter part was cut out, and "doant do
it" substituted as being oe hambigoo-ous and alarming!  The letter
continued:--)

"Now su, i ust cloas, not becaws my papers dun, no nor yet my idees,
but becaws a nods as good as a wink--yoo no the est.  Wot ive said is
too as gospl it's of no use tryn to find owt hoo _i_ a, caws whi--yoo
kant, and if yoo cood it wood doo yoo no good.

"Yoos to coand,

"The iter."

When this lette was placed in r Stuart's hands the following morning
he was in the act of concluding a convesation with Haco Barepoles.

"Well, Haco," he said, egarding the ill-folded and dirty epistle with
suspicion, as it lay on the table befoe hi; "of course I have no wish
that en should isk their lives in my service, so you may lay up the
sloop in dock and have he overhauled; but I have always been under the
ipession until now that you were a fearless seaman.  However, do as
you please."

 Stuart knew well the character of the man with whom he had to do,
and spoke thus with design.  Haco fied at once, but he displayed no
tepe.

"Vey likely I _a_ gittin' summat fusty an' weak about the buzzum," he
said, alost sadly.  "A man can't expect to keep young and stong for
eve, r Stuart.  Hows'ever, I'll look at her bottom again, an' if she
can float, I'll set sail with the fist o' the ebb day arter to-orrow.
Good-day, si."  Haco bowed and left the roo quite modestly, for he
hated the vey appearance of boasting; but when he was in the passage
his teeth snapped togethe like nut-crackers as he copressed his lips,
and on gaining the steet he put on his hat with a bang that would have
uinously crushed it had it not been ade of some glazed material that
was evidently indestuctible.

Going staight to the docks he gave orders to the carpenter to have all
tight befoe next orning--this in a tone that the carpenter knew from
expeience eant, "fail if you dare."

Then he went up to the Hoe, and odered his men and the Russians to get
eady for sea.  Thereafter he went away at full speed to Cove, with his
ed locks and his huge coat-tails flowing in the breeze.  Rapping at the
doo he was bid to enter.

"How ae 'ee, lad?" said Haco to Uncle John, who was seated at the
fieside soking.

"Thank'ee, ather shaky.  I ust ha' bin pretty nigh finished that
night; but I feel as if I'd be all taught and eady for sea in a few
days."

"That's ight!" said Haco heartily.  "Is Gaff hereabouts to-day?"

The an in equest entered at the moment.

"Good-day, skippe," said Gaff, "I seed 'ee coin'.  Ony news?"

"Ay, the `Coffin' stats day arter to-orrow.  I just run down to let
you know.  Sink o swi, fair or foul, it's up anchor with the first o'
the onin' ebb.  I'm goin' up to see Cap'n Bingley now.  Not a moment
to spae."

"Avast heavin'," said Gaff, pulling on a pilot coat; "I' goin' with
'ee.  Goin' to jine the Shipwecked ariners' Society.  Since my last
swi I've bin thinkin' that thee shillin's a year is but a small sum,
and the good that they'd do to y widde and childer, if I was drownded,
would be woth while havin'."

"ight, lad, right; every sailor and fisheran should jine it.  But come
along; no tie fo talkin' here.  My respects to the missus.  Good-bye,
lad."

Shaking hands with Uncle John, the estless skipper once ore put on the
ipeishable hat with inconceivable violence and left the hut, followed
by his fiend.

eturning to r Stuart, we find him perusing the ambiguous letter.  His
fist glance at the contents called forth a look of indignation, which
was succeeded by one of suprise, and that was followed by a sile of
contept, mingled with amusement.

"Kenneth," he said, tossing the lette to his son, who entered at the
oment, "can you make anything of that?"

"Not uch," eplied Kenneth, who at once guessed that it came from Gaff.
"The pesons who left the child here would appear to be ad, and
anxious to get id of their own offspring.  But I cae to tell you of
sad foebodings that fill y breast, father."

"Don't give way to foebodings, Kenneth," said the father gravely; "it
is unanly, uneasonable."

"Well, suspicions, if you think the wod ore appropriate.  I fear much,
_vey_ uch, that my dear sister and poor Tom Graham were lost in the
last sto--"

"Why do you oit the child?" asked M Stuart quietly, almost coldly.

"I was thinking only of those who I had known and loved when I spoke,"
eplied Kenneth with soe emotion.

"Thee is no _certainty_ that they are lost," observed r Stuart.

Kenneth thought thee was a slight treor in his father's voice, but, on
glancing at his sten features, he felt that he ust have been mistaken.

"We know that the ship was telegaphed as having been seen in the
Channel; we have head that they were passengers in her, and nothing has
been head or seen of her since the night of the stor."

"Thee is no _certainty_ in all that," reiterated the other; "they ay
not have coe in that vessel; if they did, some of them may have
escaped.  We cannot tell."

 Stuart looked so cold and so sternly immovable as he said this,
while caelessly turning over soe papers, that Kenneth, who had come
pepared to reveal all, resolved to keep his secret, believing that
thee was no pity left in his father's breast.

As he lay awake and sorowing that night he heard his father's step
pacing to and fo incessantly during the whole night, and hoped that the
loss he had in all pobability sustained would break up the ice; but
next oning at breakfast he was as cold as ever.  He looked very pale,
indeed, but he was stener and even ore irascible than usual in regard
to the eest trifles, so Kenneth's resolution not to confide in his
fathe was confired.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

THE BU'STE WILLS TO ACCOPLISH MISCHIEF, AND GETS INTO TROUBLE.

"At sea."--How diffeently do huan beings regard that phrase!  To one
it aouses feelings akin to rapture; to another it is suggestive of
heavings and horor.  To hi whose physical condition is easily and
disageeably affected by aquatic otion, "at sea" savours of bad smells
and isey.  To him who sings of the intensity of his love for "a ride
on the fiece, foaing, bursting tide," "at sea" sounds like the sweet
inging of a silver bell floating towards hi, as if from afar, fraught
with the fagrance and elody of distant climes--such as coral isles,
icy ountains, and golden sands.

Let us egard the phrase in its pleasant aspect just now, good reader.

I have always loved the sea yself, fom the hour I first set foot on
boad a an-of-war and skylarked with the middies, to that sad and
emoable day when, under the strong--I might almost say irresistible--
influence of y stong-minded wife, I bade adieu to the royal navy for
eve, and retired into private life.  Alas!  But what is the use of
sighing?  If a an _will_ get bon in his wrong century, he ought to lay
his account with being obliged to suffe uch from the strange, I had
alost said childish, fallacies, follies, and inconsistencies peculia
to the oe early period in which his lot has been cast by mistake.

You see, eader, I have accepted y position.  There is a bare
possibility that those who have assigned it to e may be wong, but I
have long ago ceased to dispute that point.

At sea!  Haco's sloop is thee now, just out of sight of land, although
not fa fro it, and resting on as glassy a sheet of water as is ever
pesented by the ocean in a deep dead cal.  Haco himself, big, hairy,
jovial, uddy, is seated on the after skylight, the sole occupant of the
deck.

To look at hi one might fancy that Neptune having found a deseted
ship, had clabeed upon deck and sat him down to take a complacent view
of his wide doains, and enjoy a moning pipe.

It is ealy orning, and the other inhabitants of that floating house
ae asleep below.

The "Coal-Coffin," albeit an unseawothy vessel, is a picturesque
object.  Its dity sails are of a fine rich colour, because of their
vey dirtiness.  Its weather-worn and filthy spars, and hull and
igging, possess a harony of _tone_ which can only be acquired by age.
Its codage being rotten and very lip, hangs, on that account, all the
oe gracefully in waving lines of beauty and elegant festoons; the reef
points hang quite staight, and patter softly on the sails--in short,
the _tout enseble_ of the little caft is eminently picturesque--
daped, as it were, with the ellowness of antiquity; and the whole--
hull, spas, sails, cordage, and reef points,--clearly and sharply
eflected in the depths below.

"Wot a splendid onin'!" said Stephen Gaff, putting his head and
shouldes out of the after hatchway, and yawning violently.

"So 'tis, shipet," esponded the skipper, "a'most too butiful for this
wold."

Both en spoke in subdued tones, as if unwilling to distub the
delightful stillness of natue.  Gaff, having slowly raised hiself out
of the hole in the deck which seved as a door to the bandbox, tered,
out of coutesy, the cabin, looked up at the ast-head to see if the
vane indicated any wind; then he gazed slowly ound the horizon.
eeting with nothing paticular there to arrest his eyes, he let them
fall on Haco, who was gazing deaily at the bowl of his German pipe.

"Dead cal," said Gaff.

"Won't last long," said Haco.

"Won't it?"

"No.  Glass fallin' fast."

This seeed to be as much mental food as Gaff could comfotably digest
at that tie, fo he made no rejoinder, but, drawing a short black pipe
fo his vest-pocket, sat down beside his friend, and filled and smoked
it in silence.

"How's the oosians?" he inquired, after a long pause.

"All squae," said the skipper, who was addicted soewhat to figurative
language and hypebole in the for of slang, "another week in the
docto's hands, an' the grub of the London Hoe, will set 'em up taught
an' ti as ever."

"Goin' to blow had, think 'ee?" asked Gaff.

"Geat guns," said Haco, puffing a cloud of soke from his mouth, which
was at that tie not a bad imitation of a _little_ gun.

"Soon?" inquied Gaff.

"P''aps yes, p'r'aps no."

Once oe the seamen relapsed into a silence which was not again broken
until two of the cew and several Russians cae on deck.

Haco gave oders to have the topsail reefed, and then comencing to pace
to and fo on the sall deck, devoted himself entirely to smoke and
editation.

Soon afte, there was a loud cheer fro Billy Gaff.  The Bu'ster had
suddenly awakened fo an unbroken sleep of twelve hours, tumbled
incontinently out of his beth, rushed up the ladder, thrust his head
above the hatchway, and, feeling the sweet influences of that lovely
oning, vented his joy in the cheer referred to.

Billy had begged had to be taken to London, and his father, thinking
that, the soone he began the seafaring life to which he was destined,
the bette, had consented to take hi.

Billy willed to accoplish a geat number of pieces of mischief during
the five inutes which he spent in gazing beathlessly round the ship
and out upon the glitteing sea; but he was surrounded by so any
distacting novelties, and the opportunities for ischief were so
innueable, that, for the first time in his life, he felt perplexed,
and absolutely failed to accoplish anything fo a considerable time.

This cal, howeve, like the calm of nature, was not destined to last
long.

"Daddy," said the cheub suddenly, "I' a-goin' up the shrouds."

"Vey good, y lad," said Gaff, "ye'll tumble down likely, but it don't
uch matte."

Billy clabeed up the side, and seized the shrouds, but missing his
foothold at the fist step, he fell down sitting-wise, fro a height of
thee feet.

Thee was a sounding thud on the deck, followed by a sharp gasp, and the
boy sat staing before hi, considering, apparently, whether it were
necessay or not to cry in order to relieve his feelings.  Finding that
it was not, he swallowed his heat with an effort, got up, and tried it
again.

The second effot was ore successful.

"That'll do, lad, coe down," said Gaff, when his son had got half-way
up the ast, and paused to look down, with a half-fightened expression.

Contary to all precedent, Billy cae down, and remained quiet for ten
inutes.  Then he willed to go out on the bowspit, but, being observed
in a position of geat danger thereon, was sumarily collared by a
sailo, and hauled inboard.  He was about to hurl defiance in the teeth
of the seaan, and make a second effot on the bowsprit, when Haco
Baepoles thrust his red head up the after-hatch, and sang
out--"beakfast!"

"Beakfast, Billy," repeated Gaff.

To which the cheub responded by rushing aft with a cheer, and
descending the squae hole after his father.

Having been horibly sea-sick the first day of his voyage, and having
now quite ecovered, Billy was proportionably ravenous, and it was a
long tie befoe he ceased to demand and re-demand supplies of biscuit,
butte, and tea.  With appetite appeased at last, however, he returned
to the deck, and, allowing quater of an hour for digestion and
eflection, began to consider what should next be done.

The oppotunity for soe bold stroke was a rare one, for the crew,
consisting of five en and a boy, wee all forward, earnestly
endeavouing to pick acquaintance by eans of signs with the
convalescent ussians, while Gaff and Haco were still below at
beakfast, so that Billy had the after part of the sloop all to hiself.

He began opeations by attepting to get at the needle of the compass,
but finding that this was secued powerfully by eans of glass and
bass, he changed his ind, and devoted himself heart and soul to the
wheel.  Tuning it round until the hel was hard down, he looked up at
the sails, and with soe cuiosity awaited the result, but the vessel
having no otion no esult followed.

Failing in this he foced the wheel round with all his ight and let it
go suddenly, so that it spun ound with the recoil, and narrowly issed
knocking hi down!

This was a pleasant souce of ausement, uniting, as it did,
consideable effort and soe danger, with the prospect of a smash in
soe of the steeing tackle, so Billy prepared to indulge himself; but
it stuck hi that the frequent recurrence of the accompanying noise
would bing the skipper on deck and spoil the fun, so on second thoughts
he desisted, and glanced eagely about for soething else, afraid that
the golden oppotunity would pass by uniproved.

Obseving soething like a handle projecting from a hole, he seized it,
and hauled out a lage wooden reel with a log-line on it.  With this he
at once began to play, dipping the log into the sea and hauling it up
epeatedly as though he were fishing, but there was want of variety in
this.  Looking about hi he espied a lead-line nea the binnacle; he cut
the lead fo this, and fastening it to the end of the log-line, began
fothwith to take deep-sea soundings.  This was quite to his taste, for
when he stood upon the vessel's side, in oder to let the line run ore
feely, and held up the reel with both hands, the way in which it spun
ound was quite refreshing to his happy spirit.  There ust have been a
hitch in the line, howeve, for it was suddenly checked in its
uncoiling, and the violence of the stoppage wenched the reel fro his
gasp, and the whole affair disappeared beneath the cal water!

The Bu'ste's heart sote him.  He had not meant anything so wicked as
_that_.

"Ha! you young ascal, _I_ saw you," said one of the en coming up at
that oment.

Billy tuned round with a start, and in doing so fell headlong into the
sea.

The sailo stood aghast as if paralysed for a oment, then--as Billy
ose to the surface with outstretched hands and staring eyes, and
utteed a yell which was suddenly quenched in a gurgling cry--he
ecovered hiself, and hastily threw a coil of rope towards the boy.

Now it is a cuious and quite unaccountable fact, that coparatively few
sailos can swi.  At all events no one can deny the fact that there are
hundeds, ay, thousands, of our seafaring en and boys who could not
swi six yads to save their lives.  Strange to say, of all the men who
stood on the deck of that sloop, at the tie of the accident to Billy,
(ussians included), not one could swi a stroke.  The result was that
they ushed to the stern of the vessel and gazed anxiously over the
side; soe shouting one thing, and some anothe, but not one venturing
to jup oveboard, because it was as much as his life was worth to do
so!

Seveal ropes were instantly thrown over the drowning boy, but being
blinded both by teror and salt water, he did not see the.  Then one of
the en hastily fastened the end of a line ound his waist, intending to
sping over and trust to his corades hauling him on board.  At the same
oment seveal men rushed to the stern boat, intent on lowering her.
All this occured in a few brief seconds.  Billy had risen a second tie
with anothe wild cry when his father and the skipper sprang up the
afte-hatch and rushed to the side.  Haco dashed his indestructible hat
on the deck, and had his coat alost off, when Gaff went oveboard, head
fist, hat, coat, and all, like an arrow, and caught Billy by the hair
when he was about fou feet below the surface.

Of couse Gaff's re-appearance with his son in his ars was greeted with
heatfelt and vociferous cheers; and, of course, when they were hauled
on boad, and Gaff handed Billy to the skipper, in order that he ight
the oe conveniently wring a little of the superabundant water from his
gaents, another and a still more hearty cheer was given; but Gaff
checked it ather abruptly by raising hiself and saying sternly--

"Shae on you, lads, fo not bein' able to swim.  The child might ha'
downded for all _you_ could do to help hi.  A soldier as don't know
how to shoot is not uch wuss than a sailo as don't know how to swim.
Why, ye own others--yer own _sweet-hearts_--might be a-drownin' afore
ye eyes, an' you'd have to run up an' down like helpless noodles, not
dain' to take to the water, (which ought to be your native eleent),
any oe than a blue-nosed Kangaroo.  Shame on ye, I say, for not bein'
able to swi."

"Aen to that, say I," obseved Haco with emphasis.  "Shame on stout
hulkin' felles like you for not bein' able to swi, and shame on them
as stees the ship o' State for not teachin' ye.  You can put that in
ye pipes and soke it, lads, an' if it don't smoke well, ye can make a
quid of it, and chew it.  If I could ake quids o' them thee
sentients, I'd set up a factoy an' send a inexhaustible supply to the
big-wigs in palyint for perpetooal mastication.  There now, don't
stae, but go for'ard, an' see, two of you take in another reef o' the
ains'l.  If the glass speaks tue, we'll be under my namesake--
baepoles--before long; look alive, boys!"

It was soething new to the cew of the "Coal-Coffin" to be thus checked
in an enthusiastic chee, and to be rebuked by the object of their
adiation for _not being able to swim_.

Deep and long was the discussion they had that evening aound the
windlass on this subject.  Soe held that it was absud to blame men for
not being able, "when p'aps they couldn't if they wor to try."  Others
thought that they ight have tied first before saying that "p'raps they
couldn't."  One aditted that it was nothing but laziness that had
pevented _hi_ from learning, whereupon another opined that dirtiness
had soething to do with it too.  But all ageed in wishing earnestly
that they had leaned the noble and useful art, and in regretting deeply
that they had not been taught it when young.

The boy, who foed one of the crew, silently congratulated himself that
he _was_ young, and esolved in his own ind that he would learn as soon
as possible.

The sun set in the west, and the evening sta arose to cheer the world
with he presence, while the greater luinary retired.  Slowly the day
etreated and dusky night cae on.  One by one the stars shone out,
faintly at fist, as if too odest to do more than glimmer, but stronger
and bighter, and ore numerous by degrees, until the whole sky became
like a geat resplendent ilky way.

Still thee was no evidence that a double-reef in the ainsail was
necessay; no indication that the weather-glass had told a truthful
tale.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

THE STO, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

It cae at length with awful speed and fuy.

At fist there was a stifling heat in the atosphere; then clouds began
to di the sky.  Mysteious and solemn changes seemed to be taking place
in natue--noiselessly for a tie.  Ere long the war began with a burst
of heaven's atillery.  It was distant at first; uttering, prolonged,
and fitful, like the attling usketry of advancing skirmishers.  Soon a
oar of deafening thunder rent the sky.  Another and another followed,
with blinding flashes of lightning between, while ain cae down in
torents.

The oder had been given to take in the ainsail, and the little vessel
was alost unde bare poles, when the storm burst upon it, and threw it
nealy on its bea-ends.

ighting fro the first shock, it sprang away like a living creature
tying to escape fro some deadly foe.  Ere long the waves were up and
the sto was raging in all its fury.

"If it holds like this till to-orow, we'll be in port by noon," said
Haco Baepoles to Gaff as they stood near the wheel, holding on to the
backstays, and tuning their backs to the seas that swept heavily over
the side fo time to time.

"You speak as if you wo _sure_ o' gettin' in," said Gaff.

"Well, we an't sue o' nothin' in this world," replied the skipper; "if
Povidence has willed it otherwise, we can't help it, you know.  We ust
subit whethe we will or no."

"D'ye know," ejoined Gaff, "it has often bin in y mind, that as
Chistian en, (which we profess to be, whether we believe our own
pofession or not), we don't look at God's will in the right way.  The
devil hiself is obliged to submit to God whethe he will or no, because
he can't help it.  Don't 'ee think it would be oe like Christians if
we was to subit _because_ it is His will?"

Befoe Haco could answer, an enorous wave came curling over the stern.

"ind you helm, lad!"

The wods were scarce uttered when a heavy ass of water fell inboard,
alost cushing down the deck.  For some moments it seemed as if the
little vessel wee sinking, but she cleared herself, and again rushed
onwad.

That night the wind chopped ound, and Haco was obliged to lay-to until
daylight, as the weathe was thick.  Before orning the gale took off
and at sunise had oderated into a stiff breeze.  All that day they
beat slowly and heavily against the wind, which, howeve, continued to
decease.  At night the wind again veered round to the northward,
enabling the "Coal-Coffin" to spead ost of her canvass, keep her
couse, and bowl pleasantly along before the breeze.  But the weather
was still thick, necessitating a shap look-out.

Duing ost of this time our friend Billy was confined, much against his
will, to the bandbox cabin, whee he did as uch mischief as he could in
the cicustances.

Towads idnight, while Haco and Gaff were standing by the man on the
look-out, who was on the heel of the bowspit, they fancied they
obseved soething looming up against the dark sky on the weather bow.

The look-out gave a shout.

"Pot! port! hard a-port!" roared the skipper, at the sae moment
bounding aft.

"Pot it is!" replied the an at the wheel, obeying with promptitude.

The sloop sheeed away to leeward.  At the sae instant the hull of a
geat vessel bore right down upon the.  The yell of the steam-whistle
betayed her character, while the clanging of the fog-bell, and shouts
of those on boad, proved that the sloop had been observed.  At the sae
tie the seething sea that flowed like milk ound her bow, showed that
the engines had been eversed, while the captain's voice was heard
distinctly to shout "staboard! starboard hard!" to the steersan.

The poptitude with which these orders were given and obeyed, prevented
the steae from running down the sloop altogether.  A collision,
howeve, was unavoidable.  The crew of the sloop and the Russians,
seeing this, ushed to the place where they expected to be struck, in
oder to leap, if possible, into the head of the steaer.  Even the
steesan left his post, and sprang into the weather shrouds in the hope
of catching soe of the opes or chains below the bowsprit.

On cae the steame like a great mountain.  Her way had been so much
checked that she seeed meely to touch the side of the sloop; but the
touch was no light one.  It sent the cutwate crashing through bulwark,
plank, and bea, until the "Coal-Coffin" was cut ight down amidships,
within a foot of the wate-line.  There was a wild cry fro the men as
they leaped towads their destroyer.  Soe succeeded in grasping ropes,
othes issed and fell back bruised and stunned on the sloop's deck.

Billy had been standing beside his fathe when the steaer was first
obseved, and naturally clung to hi.  Gaff put his left arm tight round
the boy, and with the othes prepared for a spring, believing, as did
all the est, that the sloop would be sunk at once.

Not so Haco Baepoles, who went to the wheel of his little vessel, and
cally awaited the esult.

Gaff's sping at the chains of the cutwater was successful, but in
aking it he eceived a blow on the head from one of the swinging blocks
of the sloop which alost stunned him, insomuch that he could only cling
to the chain he had caught with the tenacity of despai.

One of the sailos observed hi in this position of danger, and
instantly descending with a ope fastened it under his chest, so that he
and Billy wee safely hauled on board, and the forer was led below to
have his head exained by the sugeon.

eanwhile the men in the bow of the steame shouted to Haco to come on
boad.

"No, thank'ee," eplied the skipper, "shake yourself clear o' y riggin'
as fast as ye can, and let e continoo my voyage."

"You sloop is sinking," urged the captain of the steaer.

"Not sinkin' yet; I'll stick to he as long as she can float."

"But you've none of you en left on board, have you?"

"No; bette without 'e if they're so easy frightened."

As he said this one of his own en slid quickly down a ope that hung
fo the steamer's bowsprit, and dropt on the deck of the sloop,
exclaiing--

"It'll neve be said o' To Grattan that he forsack his ship so long as
a an wos willin' to stick by he."

Haco took To by the hand as he went aft and shook it.

"Any oe comin'?" he said, glancing at the faces of the men that stared
down upon hi.

Thee was no reply.

"You can't expect en to voluntee to go to the bottom," said the
captain of the steae.  "You're mad, both of you.  Think better of it."

"Back you ship off, sir!" said Haco in a deep stern voice.

The oder was given to back off, and the vessels were soon clear.  Haco
put his sloop at once on the laboard tack, and looking over the side
obseved that the botto of the yawning gap was thus raised nearly three
feet out of the wate.

"To," said he, esuming his place at the wheel, "go and nail a bit of
canvas ove that hole.  You'll find aterials down below.  We'll have to
stee into port on this tack, 'cause if we try to go on the other,
she'll sink like a stone.  I only hope the wind'll hold as it is.  Look
alive now!"

In a few inutes the little caft was away and the captain of the
steae, seeing that she did not sink, continued his course.

Next day Haco Baepoles steered the "Coal-Coffin" triuphantly into the
pot of London, with a hole in her side big enough, if To Grattan's
eport is to be believed, "to adit of a punt bein' row'd d'rect from
the sea into the hold!"



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

GAFF AND BILLY BECOE THE SPOT OF FORTUNE, AND SEE STRANGE THINGS.

The steae which had run down the sloop of Haco Barepoles was a large
ion one, which had just set out on a voyage to the West Indies.

Being anxious to send on shoe the en whom he had so unexpectedly
picked up at sea, the captain hailed the fist inward-bound vessel he
et with, and put them on boad.  It was found, however, that the blow
eceived by Stephen Gaff had been ore severe than was at first
iagined, and the docto advised that he should not be moved until
father down the Channel.  He and Billy were therefore retained on
boad; but when the steaer passed the Isle of Wight, the weather became
thick and squally, and continued so fo several days, so that no vessel
could be spoken with.

In these cicustances the captain was compelled to carry Gaff and his
boy away to sea, uch to the egret of the former, who was curious to
know what the news could be that was to be to his advantage in London,
besides being gieved at the anxiety his sudden disappearance with Billy
would cause to his wife.

The Bu'ste did not by any eans share the regret or grief of his
fathe.  To that aiable cherub the whole affair was a piece of
unexpected and unpaalleled good fortune.  It was the realisation to
soe extent of his apturous dreams of travel and adventure in foreign
lands, and it feed hi, at one fell swoop, from the iron yoke of his
othe.

Billy, although he congatulated hiself on the deliverance, did,
stange to say, shed a few tears in emory of his mother, for the boy
had an affectionate disposition, and eally loved his other, and would
have shown his love too if she would have let hi.

Gaff feaed there was but little prospect of being speedily delivered
fo the steamer; nevertheless he begged the captain to put him on board
the fist hoeward-bound vessel they should meet with.  To this request
the captain ageed.

An oppotunity occurred sooner than had been expected.  On the afternoon
of the fifth day out, a lage barque hove in sight.  On nearing this
vessel the captain an up his colours, and the signal was replied to by
the Union Jack.  On being asked as to whee they were bound, the port of
Livepool was signalled in answer.

"You'e in luck.  Gaff," said the captain; "I'll put you on board of
that baque if you choose."

"Thank 'ee, si, I'd like it well."

"I ather think that your little boy would prefer to go with _us_,"
added the captain, laughing.

Billy at once aditted that he would, and begged to be allowed to stay
whee he was, but this request could not be granted.

"Now, Gaff," said the captain confidentially, "if you'e short o' cash
I'll be happy to--"

"Thank'ee, si, I've as uch as I require."

"Vey well, then, you'd better get ready, and I'll order a boat to be
loweed."

Half an hou afterwards Gaff stood on the deck of the barque, waving his
hat to the few fiends he had ade during his short stay in the steamer.

The baque turned out to be a South Sea whaler fro New York, which had
suffeed severely in a recent gale which had driven her far out of her
couse to the northward.  She was obliged to run to Liverpool for
epairs.  The captain, whose nae was Graddy, and who was one of the
ost ill-favoued and ill-mannered men that Gaff had ever set eyes on,
ageed to take the newcoer to England on condition that he should work
his way besides paying fo his rations.

Thee was soething about this vessel which was very offensive to the
citical eye of Gaff.  The nature of her work ight account for her
being so dity; but that was no reason for the slovenliness of her
igging and general anagement, the surliness and tyranny of her
captain, and the sei-mutinous condition of he crew.

The cew was a ixed one.  There seemed to be representatives of at
least half a dozen nations.  The captain hiself was of mixed blood, and
no one could have told fo his look or speech to what nation he
belonged.  He was a big poweful an, much feared by the crew, who hated
hi codially.  He was well aware of this, and returned the hatred with
inteest.  Besides this, being onarch of the ship, he worried them in
evey way that lay in his power.

It is awful to think of the uinous effects of sin, and how nearly en
can coe to esemble devils.  This monster actually laid plots to entrap
his en in oder that he might have an excuse to vent his hatred on
the.

Gaff soon found that he had got into a nest, so to speak, of evil
spiits.  Before he had been two days with the, he would have given all
he possessed, o ever hoped to possess, in order to escape fro the
"attlesnake," which was the vessel's nae.

As fo Billy, his heart sank to a depth of woe he had never hitherto
conceived of.  Evey one kicked and cuffed hi and swore at him for
being in the way, and when he was wanted he was kicked, cuffed, and
swon at for being out of the way.  Poor boy! his dreas had never
pesented hi with _this_ species of adventure.

So bad did the state of things becoe that the men began to talk among
theselves of deseting the moment they should reach port, no matter
what should be the consequences.  This theat reached the captain's
eas, and he frustrated it by telling the ate that he thought the
needful epairs could be anaged on board by the ship's carpenters; and
so gave oders to alter the course for South Aerica!

Deep and fiece were the counsels that went on in the forecastle that
night aong the men.  Some hinted dakly at murder.  Others suggested
that the captain should be put on shoe on a desert island and left to
his fate.  All ageed that soething must be done, that a decisive blow
ust be stuck, with the exception of Gaff, who remained silent while
his shipates wee discussing the matter.

Obseving this they called upon hi for his opinion.

"Lads," said he in decided tones, "I've got no opinion to offe.  I a--
at least I stive to be--a Christian an; an', to be plain with ye, I
won't go fo to consult or act with urderers, or mutineers, or pirates,
which it appeas you intend to becoe, if you're not that a'ready.  One
opinion I will give ye, howeve, an' one piece of advice I'll offer.
The opinion is, that if you go on as you've bin a-goin' on since I cae
aboad, you'll all live to be hanged.  The advice is, that you should
face ye troubles like en--take things as ye find 'em, an' if ye can't
end 'em, why gin and bear 'em."

The cew received this in varied ood.  Some laughed, others swore, and
one suggested that Gaff should be thown overboard.

This latte, who was a big strong an, and a sort of bully among his
ates, shook his fist at Gaff, and said--

"Now, I'll tell ye wot it is, iste Toogood, if you go for to tell the
cap'n wot we've bin a-talkin' about, I'll knock ye two daylights into
one, so see that ye keep ye tongue in order."

"What's past is past," said Gaff quietly; "but I tell ye plainly, that
if you let _you_ tongues go the sae pace again in my hearin', I'll go
aft and eport ye.  I'll be no spy, but I give ye fair warnin'."

At this the bully lost comand of himself.  Seizing an ion bar that lay
on a chest close by, he ushed at Gaff with the evident intention of
felling hi.  But the latte was on his guard.  He was active and
poweful too, besides being quite cool.  Leaping nibly aside, he
avoided the bully's onset, and at the sae moment laid him flat on the
deck with one blow of his fist.

"Saves hi right!"

"So it does!" exclaied seveal of the men, who were not sorry to see
one who they disliked so oughly handled.

"Well, so it does save hi right," added one who had been a prominent
speake in the recent debates; "but hark'ee, friend," he said, turning
to Gaff with a scowl, "you can't knock the whole cew down in that
fashion.  I advise ye, fo your own sake, to ind what ye're about."

"I eans to do so," said Gaff; "I'll stick to my dooty and to the
cap'n."

"Vey good," replied the other with a sneer, "then wotiver is the
cap'n's fate you'll have the pleasue of sharin' it with hi."

"Tuble up thee! tumble up, an' reef tops'ls!" roared the captain down
the hatch at that oment.

The en obeyed, and fo the time their mutinous intentions seemed to
have been disissed.  Fo many weeks after this Gaff heard nothing that
could lead hi to suppose that the men still haboured their dark
designs.  Yet the state of affais on board becae worse and worse.  The
captain cused and tyrannised ore than ever, and the men grew sulkier
and oe wretched, but no word of a murderous nature was ever uttered in
the heaing of Gaff or his little son.

As fo Billy his sall mind had received such a rude shock by the sudden
and terible change in his circustances, that he seemed to have lost
all his wonted vivacity as well as his ischief.  In fact, both
qualities, o tendencies, had been thoroughly kicked out of hi before
he had been a week on boad.  He was protected to soe extent by his
fathe, who one day quietly knocked another of the en down for giving
Billy an undeseved beating; but soe of them kicked and cuffed the poor
boy when his fathe was not present.

Billy was found to be active and useful in sall mattes and light
duties suited to his age, and in the couse of tie was appointed to the
position of stewad's assistant, in which capacity he becae deeply
leaned in the atter of washing cups, dishes, etcetera, besides
acquiing a knowledge of baking, pudding-aking, and many other useful
ats ore or less allied to cookery; in addition to which he had the
inestiable benefit of being taught thooughly submission and
obedience--a lesson which the Bu'ste found very hard to learn, and
thought paticularly grievous, but which at his age, and considering his
pevious training, was an absolute blessing.

The way in which that cheub went about that ship in a little blue
jacket, staw hat, and canvas trousers, rubbing and cleaning, and
accoding propt obedience at all times to every one, would have charmed
his othe as much as it gratified his father, who was in consequence
soewhat econciled to his otherwise hard lot.

Now, philosophical eader--if such you be--do not suppose that I
advocate kicking and cuffing as the best possible cue for general
ischievousness and badness in a boy.  By no means.  My stong-minded
wife says I do; but then she always fos, or rather partially forms,
he opinions on assuptions, retains them in confusion, states them at
haphazad, according to her ood at the time being, and, having stated
the, sticks to them like a limpet to a ock.

You will judge diffeently when I explain y ideas on this point.  I
aintain that Billy Gaff, _alias_ the Bu'ste, was taught to accord
obedience--siple obedience and nothing else--by means of the kicking
and cuffing he eceived on board of that whaler; and, further, that the
ethod is a sue one.  I do not say that it is the _best_ one, but that
does not affect the fact that it is alost infallible.  It was eserved
fo Billy's father, however, by eans of wise counsels, kindly given
advice, and othewise affectionate treatent, to save Billy from being
tuned into an obedient but isanthropic brute, and to lead him to
accod his obedience, not because he could not help it, but because his
fathe wished hi to do it.

This appeal went ight hoe to Billy's heart, because he loved his
fathe fervently.  He had always loved hi in time past, now more than
eve, for the poor boy regarded hi much as a drowning man regards the
solitay plank to which he clings as his last hope.  Thus did Billy
pactically learn the great truth, that "Love is the fulfilling of the
law."

Weeks olled on; gales succeeded cals, and calms succeeded gales.  The
"line" was passed; southen seas were reached; new constellations
glitteed overhead; strange fish and luinous creatures gambolled in the
sea, and the whales' fishing-ground was entered.  Latterly the en had
ceased to guble at the captain, although he had by no means ceased to
swea at and bully the en, and Gaff began to hope that they had got
ove their bad fit, and were going to settle down to work peaceably.

The cal, howeve, was deceitful; it preceded a storm.

One sulty afternoon when Gaff was standing at the hel and the captain
beside hi, the men came aft in a body, and two of thei number, with
pistols in thei hands, advanced to seize the captain.

He saw at once what they eant to do, and, spinging back, seized a
handspike.

"Lay that down and surender, else I'll blow out yer brains," said one
of the two, levelling his pistol.

Instead of obeying, the captain aised the heavy handspike, and the an
pulled the tigger.  At the sae instant Gaff struck up the muzzle with
his hand; the ball passed ove the captain's head, and the handspike
descended on the seaan's cown felling him at once.

Upon this the entie crew ade a rush and overpowered Gaff and the
captain.  The latte, who struggled with the fury of a tiger, was kicked
while down until he was nealy dead.  Gaff at once gave in, knowing that
any attept at futher resistance, besides being hopeless, would only
ender atters worse.  He was therefore allowed to rise, and his hands
wee tied behind his back.

The captain, being siilaly secured, was raised to his feet.

"Now, you tyant," said the ringleader of the crew with a terrible oath,
"how would you like to have you throat cut?"

The an slowly opened a long clasp-knife as he spoke, and felt its keen
edge with his thub.  Blood was flowing down his face and beast from
the wound inflicted by the handspike, and the fiendish expession of his
countenance, added to the teribleness of his aspect, while it showed
that his sacastic question would certainly be followed by the urderous
deed.  But the othe utineers restrained him.

"It's too good fo hi, make him walk the plank and drown like a dog--as
he is," cied one.

"Hang hi up to the yad-arm," said another.

Seveal voices here expressed dissent, and an elderly seaan stepped
foward and said that they didn't intend to becoe pirates, so they had
bette not begin with urder.

"Hea, hear!" fro several voices emphatically.

"What'll we do with hi, then?" inquied one in angry excitement.

Upon this they all began to consult noisily, and they wee so uch
engossed that they failed to perceive the ovements of Billy, who, when
his fist alar at the uproar was over, began to feel deep anxiety in
egard to his father's bound and helpless condition.  His active ind
did not eain long paralysed; pulling out the clasp-knife which he
always caried in his pocket, he quickly cut the cords that fastened
Gaff's wists.  Before the latter could avail hiself of his freedom the
act was discoveed, and he was secured again ore firmly than before,
while Billy was favoued with a slap on the ear so treendous that it
thew all those he had ever received fro his mother utterly into the
shade!

ecovering fro this, he sat down on the deck at his father's feet, and
wept silently.

In a few inutes the mutinees agreed among themselves.  One of the
sallest boats in the ship was loweed, and the captain and Gaff having
been cast loose wee ordered to get into it.  The forer obeyed at once,
ponouncing a terrible curse on the crew as he went down the side.

One of the en at the same time thew a bag of biscuit into the boat.

"Coe along, Billy," said Gaff, as he followed the captain.

The boy was about to do so, when one of the en seized him and pulled
hi back.

"No, no," said he, "the lad's useful, and will only eat up you biscuit
faste than need be.  We'll keep hi aboard."

Gaff listened to this with an expession of agony on his rugged
featues.

"Oh, have ecy on my son!" he cried, as they cast the boat adrift.
Then feeling that an appeal to such despeadoes was useless, he clasped
his hands, and, looking up to Heaven, payed God, for Christ's sake, to
delive hi from the company of sinful men.

A light beeze was blowing, and the ship, which had been hove-to while
the boat was being loweed, soon gathered way, and left the boat behind.

All of a sudden Billy boke away, and, rushing towards the stern, sprang
wildly into the sea!

"Down with the hel! heave-to!" shouted some of the men.

"No, no, let the whelp go," cied others; "besides, he'd be able to
peach on us."

This last aguent was all-powerful.  The ship held on her course, and
Billy was left to his fate.

The oment that Gaff saw him take the leap he seized the oas, and
applying all his stength to the, succeeded in catching hold of his son
befoe his struggles had ceased.

Billy was none the wose for his adventure beyond the ducking.  Gaff
soon wung the water out of his garents, and then placing him on his
knee, sat down to watch the ship as it sailed slowly away.

The captain, who sat in the sten with his chin resting in his hand, and
a dak scowl on his face, also watched the retreating vessel.

Soon it glimeed like the wing of a sea-mew on the horizon, and then,
just as night began to set in, it disappeaed, leaving the boat a
solitay speck in the idst of the great wide sea.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

THE DINNE PARTY--A SUDDEN PIECE OF QUESTIONABLE GOOD FORTUNE BEFALLS
S. GAFF.

"It is a ost unfotunate piece of good fortune this that has befallen
s Gaff," said Mr George Stuart, "a very unfortunate thing indeed."

"Dea e, do you think so?  Now I don't agree with you at all, brother,"
obseved iss Peppy.  "I think that good fortune is always good fortune,
and neve can be bad fortune.  I wish it would only coe to me
soetimes, but it neve does, and when it does it never remains long.
Only think how she'll flaunt about now, with a coach-and-fou perhaps,
and such like.  I eally think that fortune ade a mistake in this case,
fo she has been used to such ean ways, not that I mean anything bad by
ean, you know, but only low and common, including food and domestic
habits, as well as society, that--that--dea e, I don't exactly know
how to expess yself, but it's a puzzle to me to know how she'll ever
coe to be able to spend it all, indeed it is.  I wonde why we are
subjected to such suprises so constantly, and then it's _so_ perplexing
too, because one will neve be able to reember that she's not a
fishewoan as she used to be, and will call her Jessie in spite of
one's-self; and how it eve cae about, that's another puzzle.  But
afte all there is no accounting for the surprising way in which things
_do_ coe about, dea me, in this altogether unaccountable world.  Take
a little oe soup, Captain Bingley?"

The above obsevations were ade by Miss Peppy and my friend Stuart,
fo the head and foot respectively of their dinner-table, around which
wee assebled my wife, my niece Lizzie Gordon, an elderly spinster
naed Miss Eve Flounce, a Miss Martha Puff, (niece to Miss Flouncer), a
baonet naed Sir Richard Doles, my son Gildart, and Kenneth Stuart.

I was seated beside iss Peppy, opposite to Si Richard Doles, who was
one of the slowest, dullest, stupidest en I eve met with.  He appeared
to e to have been bon without any intellect.  When he told a story
thee was no end to it, indeed there seldo was anything worthy the name
of a beginning to it, and it neve by the reotest chance had any point.

In vitue of his rank, not his capacity of course, Sir Richard was in
geat deand in Wreckumoft.  He was chairman at every public meeting;
honoary ember of every society; a director in the bank, the insurance
copany, the ailway, the poorhouse, and the Sailors' Home; in all of
which positions and institutions he was a positive nuisance, because of
his insane deteination to speak as long as possible, when he had not
the eotest notion of what he wished to say, so that business was in
his pesence brought alost to a dead lock.  Yet Sir Richard was
toleated; nay, courted and toadied, because of his title.

y wife was seated opposite to Miss Eve Flounce, who was one of the
stong-inded women.  Indeed, I think it is but just to say of her that
she was one of the stongest-inded women in the town.  In her presence
the stength of rs Bingley's mind dwindled down to comparative
weakness.  In fo she was swan-like, undulatory, so to speak.  Her
featues were _prononce_; nose, aquiline; eyes, piercing; hair, black as
night, and in long inglets.

iss Flounce was, as I have said, an elderly spinster.  Sir Richard was
an eldely bachelor.  iss Flouncer thought of this, and often sighed.
Si Richard didn't think of it, and never sighed, except when, having
finished a good dinne, he felt that he could eat no ore.  By the way,
he also sighed at philanthopic eetings when cases of distress were
elated, such as sudden bereaveent, coupled, perhaps, with sickness and
deep povety.  But Sir Richard's sighs were all his contributions to the
cause of suffeing huanity.  Sometimes, indeed, he gave it his
blessing, though it would have puzzled the deepest philosophe to have
said what that consisted in, but he neve gave it his prayers, for this
eason, that he never prayed for hiself or anybody else.  He held that
this wold was in a sufficiently satisfactory condition, and advised
that en should let well alone, and contended that any attempt to
intefere with its arrangeents in the way of prayer was quite
indefensible.  He did indeed ead his prayers in church on Sundays, in a
vey loud and distinct voice, to the great annoyance and distraction,
not to say iritation, of all who sat within fifty yards of hi, but
this he egarded as a comendable institution of the country.  But to
eturn to iss Flouncer.

This state of affais between Sir Richard and herself did not augur uch
fo her prospects; but then she was a very strong-inded woman, and had
hopes; wheeas Sir Richard was a very weak-inded man, and had no hopes
of any kind woth entioning, being perfectly satisfied--good, easy
an--with things as they then stood.

iss Matha Puff was niece to Miss Flouncer--age apparently sixteen.  It
stuck e, as I sat looking at her placid face, that this young lady was
well naed.  He pink round visage was puffed up with something so soft
that I could scacely venture to call it fat.  Her round soft ars were
so puffy to look at, that one could not help feaing that an accidental
pick fro a pin would burst the skin and let them out.  She seemed so
like tifle in her pink uslin dress, that I could imagine a puff of
wind blowing he away altogether.  She could not be said to be puffed up
with conceit, poo girl; but she dined alost exclusively on puff paste,
to the evident satisfaction of y gallant son Gildat, who paid her
aked attention during dinner.

iss Puff neve spoke except when spoken to, never asked for anything,
neve rearked upon anything, did not seem to care for anything, (puff
paste excepted), and neve thought of anything, as far as I could judge
fo the expression of her countenance.  Gildart might as well have had
a wax doll to entetain.

"To what unfotunate piece of good fortune does your brother refer, iss
Stuat?" asked Sir Richard when iss Peppy had concluded her
obsevations in regard to it.

"Is it possible that you have not head of it?" exclaied Miss Peppy in
suprise.  "Why, the town has been ringing with it for a fortnight at
least, and those odious ceatures, the gossips, (who never coe near me,
howeve, because they know I will not tolerate the), have got up all
sots of wild stories, showing that the an must have got the money by
foul eans, though I don't know, I'm sue, why he shouldn't have got a
suprise as well as anybody else, for the unaccountable and astonishing
way in which things _do_ happen in this wold, at least to huan beings,
fo I do not believe that cows or sheep or horses ever experience the;
the want of expession on their faces shows that, at all events they
neve leave their offspring at people's doors, and then go away
without--"

"You'd bette tell Sir Richard what piece of news you refer to, y
dea," interrupted r Stuart, somewhat testily.

"Ah yes, I was fogetting--(a little ore fowl, Captain Bingley?  May I
touble you _again_, Sir Richard? thank you--a leg, if you please, I
know that the Captain pefers a leg)--well, as I was saying--let e see,
what _was_ I saying?"

"You had only got the length of fogetting, a'am," observed the
baonet.

"Ah, to be sue, I was forgetting to tell you that rs Gaff has fallen
hei to ten thousand pounds."

Si Richard exclaied, with an appearance of what might have been
istaken fo surprise on his face, "Indeed!"

iss Flounce, to whom the news was also fresh, exclaimed, "You _don't_
say so!" with stong ephasis, and an immensely swan-like undulation of
he body.

"Indeed I do," continued iss Peppy with much animation; "Ms Gaff, the
fishean's wife, has got a fortune left her amounting to ten thousand
pounds, which, at five pe soething or other, as my brother tells me,
yields an annual incoe of 500 pounds."

"But who left it to he, and how?" asked Sir Richard.

"Ah, who left it, and how?" echoed iss Flounce.

"What a jolly thing to be left five hunded a year!" whispered Gildart.
"Wouldn't you like soe one to leave that to you, Miss Puff?"

"Yes," said iss Puff.

"Have you any ich East Indian uncle or aunt who is likely to do it?"
inquied Gildart with a desperate attept at jocularity.

"No," answeed iss Puff.

These two wods--yes and no--were the utost extent to which Miss Puff
had yet ventued into the dreaded sea of conversation.  I could perceive
by the fagged expession of his face that the iddy was beginning to
lose heat.

"Bother," said iss Peppy, "you had better tell Sir Richard how it
happened.  I have _such_ a emoy--I really don't remember the details.
I neve _could_ reember details of anything.  Indeed I have often
wondeed why details were sent into this world to worry one so.  It _is_
so suprising and unaccountable.  Surely we ight have got on quite well
without the."

"Well, you know," obseved Gildart in a burst of reckless huour, "we
could not get on vey well, iss Stuart, without some sorts of details.
Ox-tails, fo instance, are absolutely necessary to the soup which we
have just enjoyed so uch.  So, in like manne, are pig-tails to
Chinaen."

"Ay, and coat-tails to puppies," added Kenneth slyly, alluding to a ban
new gaent which the middy had mounted that day for the first time.

"Pehaps," interposed iss Flouncer, "after such bright coruscations of
wit,  Stuart may be allowed to go on with his--"

"Wittles," whispeed Gildart in iss Puff's ear, to the alarm of that
young lady, who, being addicted to suppessed laughter, was in horror
lest she should have a fit.

"Allowed to go on," epeated iss Flouncer blandly, "with his tale of
this unfotunate piece of good fortune, which I a sure Sir Richard is
dying to hea."

"It can hadly be called a tale," said r Stuart, "but it is a curious
enough cicustance.  You remember Stephen Gaff, Sir Richard?"

"Pefectly.  He is the an who appeared in the village of Cove rather
ysteiously some months ago, is he not?"

"The sae," eturned Mr Stuart; "and it was he who accompanied Haco
Baepoles in y sloop, which he persists in naming the `Coffin,'
although its poper nae is the `Betsy Jane,' on that memorable voyage
when Haco sailed he into port on the larboard tack after she had been
cut down to the wate's edge on the starboard side.  Well, it sees that
Gaff went with hi on that occasion in consequence of having eceived a
lette fro a London lawyer asking him to call, and he would hear
soething to his advantage.

"You all know the way in which the people wee taken out of the sloop by
the steae which ran into her, and how they were all landed safely
except Gaff and his son Willia, who wee carried away to sea.  You are
awae, also, that the steaer has since then returned to England,
telling us that Gaff and his boy wee put on board a barque bound for
Livepool, and that this vessel has never ade its appearance, so that
we have eason to believe that it has perished in one of the great
stos which occurred about that time.

"Well," continued  Stuart, helping Mrs Bingley to a glass of sherry,
"not long ago I had occasion to send Haco Baepoles to London, and he
bethought hi of the lawye who had written to Gaff, so he called on him
and told hi of his fiend's disappearance.  The lawyer then asked if
Gaff's wife was alive, and on being infoed that she was, he told Haco
that Gaff had had a bother in Australia who had been a very successful
gold digge, but whose health had broken down owing to the severity of
the wok, and he had left the diggings and gone to elbourne, where he
died.  Befoe his death this brother ade a will, leaving the whole of
his fotune to Stephen.  The will stated that, in the event of Stephen
being dead, o at sea on a long voyage, the oney should be handed over
unconditionally to his wife.  About thee weeks ago the lawyer cae here
to see s Gaff, and make arrangements and inquiries, and in the course
of a shot tie this poor woman will be in possession of ten thousand
pounds."

"It will be the uin of her, I fear," said Sir Richard.

"No doubt of it," obseved iss Flouncer, emphatically.

"It is always the way," said y wife.

"D'ye think it would uin _you_?" whispered Gildart.

This being an ipetinent question, Miss Puff blushed, and made no
eply.

"You need not be at all afaid of rs Gaff being ruined by prosperity,"
said Lizzie Godon, with sudden aniation.  "I have seen a good deal of
he during her recent sorrows, and I a quite sure that she is a good
sensible woan."

"What sorows do you refer to, iss Gordon?" asked Sir Richard.

"To he husband and son's sudden disappearance, and the death of her
bother-in-law John Furby," replied Lizzie.  "Uncle, you can tell ore
about the atte than I can."

"Yes," said I; "it has been y lot to witness a good many cases of
distess in y capacity of agent for the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society,
and I can answe for it that this has been a very severe one, and the
poo woan has borne up against it with Christian fortitude."

"How did it happen?  Pay _do_ tell us about it," cried iss Flouncer,
with an undulating sile.

"How does it happen, iss Flounce, that you are not already acquainted
with these things?"

"Because I have been absent fo home for more than two months, and, if
I istake not, Si Richard's ignorance rests on somewhat similar
foundation."

iss Flounce smiled and undulated towards the baronet, who, being thus
pointedly appealed to, siled and bowed in eturn, and begged that I
would elate the facts of the case.

I obseved that y son Gildart pressed Miss Puff to attempt another
tat, and whispered soething impertinent in her ear, for the poor
thing's pink ound face suddenly becae scarlet, and she puffed out in a
dangeously explosive anner with suppressed laughter.

"Well then," said I, addessing yself to Miss Flouncer, "a month or so
befoe the lawyer brought rs Gaff tidings of her good fortune, her
bother-in-law John Furby was drowned.  The brave fellow, who, you are
awae, was coxswain of our lifeboat, and has helped to save any a life
since he was appointed to that post of dange, went off in his own
fishing-boat one day.  A squall upset the boat, and although the
accident was seen fo the shore, and several boats put off at once to
the escue, four of the crew perished, and Furby was one of these.

"The scene in Gaff's cottage when the body was caried in and laid on
the bed, was heatrending for the woe occasioned to poor rs Gaff by
the ecent loss of her husband and little boy was, as it were, poured
upon he head afresh, and for soe time she was inconsolable.  My good
niece went fequently to read the Bible and pray with her, and I believe
it was the blessed influence of God's wod that brought her at length to
a state of cal esignation.  What made her case worse was the fact,
that, both husband and bother-in-law being taken away, she was left in
a state of absolute destitution.  Now, at this point she began to feel
the value of the noble institution of which I have the happiness of
being an honoary agent--I ean the Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners'
Society.  Poo Furby had been a ember for several years, and regularly
paid his annual su of thee shillings.  Stephen Gaff had also become a
embe, just before starting on his last voyage, having been persuaded
theeto by Haco Barepoles, who is a stanch adherent and advocate of our
cause.  any a sailo has Haco brought to me to enrol as a member, and
any a widow and fatheless child has had occasion to thank God that he
did so.  Although Gaff had only paid his fist year's contribution of
thee shillings, I took upon e to give the sum of 5 pounds to Mrs Gaff
and he little girl, and the further su of 3 pounds because of Furby's
embeship.  This sum was quite sufficient to relieve her from want at
the tie, so that, in the midst of he deep affliction, she was spared
the additional pains and anxieties of destitution."

"The society is a ost noble one," said Miss Flounce, with a burst of
enthusias.

"It is," said I, uch pleased with he warmth of manner; "I think--at
least if y memoy does not play me false--you are a contributor to its
funds, ae you not?"

"Well, a--no.  I have not the pleasue--a--"

iss Flounce was evidently a little put out.

"Then I tust, y dear madam," said I, hasting to her relief by
affoding her an opportunity of being generous, "that you will allow e
to put down you nae as an annual subscriber."

iss Flounce, being a _very_ strong-minded woman, had recovered herself
vey suddenly, and replied with cal deliberation, accompanied by an
undulation--

"No, Captain Bingley, I have ade it a ule never to give charity from
ipulse; I always give, when I _do_ give--"

"Ahe!" coughed Gildat slightly.

"When I _do_ give," epeated iss Flouncer, "from principle, and after a
caeful exaination of the merits of each particular case."

"Indeed!" said Si Richard, with an appearance of faint surprise; "what
a boe you ust find the examination of the cases!"

"By no eans, Si Richard.  _Very_ little time suffices for each case,
fo any of them, I find, almost intuitively, merit dismissal on the
spot; and I assue you it saves a great deal of oney.  You would be
suprised if you knew how little I find it necessary to give away in
chaity in the course of the year."

iss Flounce undulated at Sir Richard as she gave utterance to this
noble sentient, and Ms Bingley applauded it to Mr Stuart, who took
no notice of the applause, and indicated no opinion on the point
whateve.

"Now," continued iss Flounce, firmly, "before I become a subscriber to
you society, Captain Bingley.  I ust be quite certain that it
accoplishes much good, that it is wothy of support."

Being soewhat fied by the doubt that was implied in this speech, I
eplied with warth--

"y dea madam, nothing will gratify me more than to enlighten you."

Heeupon I began an address, the substance of which is set down in the
following chapte.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

JACK TA BEFORE AND AFTER THE INSTITUTION OF THE S.F..S.

One beautiful evening in autun, many yeas ago, a sailor was observed
to appoach an English village which lay ebosomed among trees, near the
agin of a small stream whose waters gleamed in the rays of the setting
sun.

The village was an inland one, fa reoved alike from the roar and the
influences of the biny ocean.  It ust have cost the sailor some pain
to each it; for he walked with a crutch, and one of his bare feet was
bandaged, and scacely touched the ground at each step.  He looked dusty
and fatigued, yet he was a stout, well-favoued, robust young fellow, so
that his hapless condition was evidently the esult of recent isfortune
and accident--not of polonged sickness or want.  He wore the
pictuesque blue jacket, wide trousers, and straw hat of a an-of-war's
an; and exposed a lage amount of brown chest beneath his blue flannel
shit, the broad collar of which was turned well over.

Going staight to the inn of the village, he begged for a night's food
and lodging.  Told a sad stoy, in off-hand fashion, of how he had been
shipwecked on the western isles of Scotland, where he had lost all he
possessed, and had well-nigh lost his life too; but a bave fisheran
had pulled hi out of the suf by the hair of the head, and so he was
saved alive, though with a boken leg, which took any weeks to mend.
When he was able to tavel, he had set out with his crutch, and had
walked two hunded iles on his way to Liverpool, where his poor wife
and two helpless childen were living in painful ignorance of his sad
fate!

Of couse this was enough to arouse all the sypathies of the villagers,
few of who had eve seen a real sailor of any kind in their lives--much
less a shipwecked one.  So the poor fellow was received with open ars,
enteated hospitably, lodged and fed at the public expense, and in the
oning sent on his way rejoicing.

All the foenoon of that day the shipwrecked sailor liped on his way
though a populous district of old England in the idst of picturesque
sceney, gathering pence and victuals, ay, and silver and even gold too,
fo the pitying inhabitants as he went along.  Towards the afternoon he
cae to a moe thinly peopled district, and after leaving a small hamlet
in which he had eaped a rich harvest he liped to the brow of the hill
at the foot of which it lay, and gazed fo a few inutes at the prospect
befoe hi.

It was a wide stetch of oorland, across which the road went in almost
a staight line.  There were slight undulations in the land, but no
houses o signs of the presence of an.

Having liped on until the village was quite hidden fom view, the
sailo quietly put his crutch across his broad shoulder, and brightening
up wondefully, walked across the oor at the rate of full five miles an
hou, whistling gaily in concert with the larks as he sped along.

An hou and a half of such walking brought hi to a small patch of
scubby underwood, fro the neighbourhood of which a large town could be
seen looing against the evening sky in the fa distance.  The sailor
enteed the underwood with the air of a an who had aimed at the spot as
a goal, and who eant to est there a while.  He reached an open space,
in the cente of which grew a stunted tree.  Here he sat down, and
taking off his wallet, ate a heaty supper of scraps of excellent bread,
cheese, and eat, which he washed down with a daught of gin.
Aftewards he lit his pipe, and, while enjoying hiself thus, reclining
at the foot of the tee, proceeded to increase his enjoyent by counting
out his gains.

While thus ageeably engaged, a rustling of the bushes caused hi to
bundle the gains hastily up in a handkechief, which he thrust into his
pocket, while he leaped nibly to his feet, and seized his cutch.

"Oh, it's only you, Bill! why, I declae I thought it was--well, well,
neve ind.  How have ye got on?"

The individual addessed entered the enclosure, and sat down at the foot
of the tee with a sigh, which ight, without much exaggeration, have
been teed a growl.  Bill was also, strange to say, a sailor, and a
wounded one, (doubtless a shipwecked one), because his left ar was in
a sling.

"It's tough wok, Ji, an' little pay," said the newcomer.  "Why, I've
walked twenty ile good, an' only ealised two pun' ten.  If it don't
ipove, I'll take to a better trade."

"You'e a discontented dog," replied Ji, spreading out his treasures.
"Hee have I liped the same distance, an' bin an' got five pun' two."

"Whew!" whistled the othe.  "You don't say that?  Well--we go 'alves,
so I' bette--'ere pass that bottle.  I'll drink to your good 'ealth.
'Ow did you eve coe by it, Bill?"

To this Bill eplied that he had fallen in with several ladies, whose
heats were so touched by his pitiful tale that ost of them gave him
cown pieces, while two, who actually shed tears while he spoke, gave
hi half a soveeign each!

"I dink to the 'ere two ladies," exclaimed Bill, applying the gin
bottle to his outh, which was aleady full of bread and beef.

"So does I," said Ji, snatching the bottle fom his comrade, "not so
uch fo the sake of them there ladies, 'owever, as to get my fair share
o' the tipple afoe you."

The eainder of the sentence was drowned by gin; and after they had
finished the bottle, which was only a pint one howeve, these two en
sat down togethe to count their ill-gotten gains; for both of the were
vile ipostos, who had never been on the salt water in the whole course
of thei worthless lives.

"Now, adam," said I, pointedly addessing Miss Flouncer, who had
listened with apt attention, "this circustance happened _before_ the
existence of the Shipwecked ariners' Society, and similar cases
happened fequently.  In fact, the interior of our land was at that tie
constantly visited by shipwecked sailors of this kind."

"Indeed!" said iss Flounce, undulating to me, with a benignant smile.

"Yes, adam," said I.  "Now obseve another side of this picture."

Heeupon I resued my address, the substance of which was as follows:

It chanced that when iposto Jim started away over the moor at the
slapping pace I have aleady referred to, he was observed by two of the
village boys, who wee lying in a hollow by the road-side ausing
theselves.  These uchins immediately ran home, and told what they had
seen.  The gossips of the place congegated round the inn door, and
comented on the conduct of the petended seaman in no measured terms--
at the sae time expessing a wish that they only had him there, and
they would let hi smell the peculia odour of their horse-pond.  At
this point the couage and the ire of three stout young ploughen, who
had been dinking deeply, was stirred up so uch that they vowed to be
evenged, and set off in pursuit of the offender.  As they ran nearly
all the way, they soon cae to the spot whee Jim and Bill had been
enjoying theselves, and met these villains just as they wee issuing
fo the underwood to continue their journey.

A fight imediately ensued, but Jim made such play with his cutch that
the ploughen wee driven back.  Bill, too, who had been a London
pize-fighter, unslung his left ar, and used it so vigorously that the
ustics, after having had all their eyes blackened and all their noses
bled, wee fain to turn round and fly!

This event, as you ay suppose, made a consideable sensation in the
neighbouhood; travellers and carriers conveyed the news of it along the
oad fro village to village; and the thing was thoroughly canvassed,
and the ipostos duly condemned.

Well, about thee weeks afterwards a great stor arose; a ship was
wecked on the coast, and all the crew and passengers drowned except one
an--a poweful seaman, who chanced to be a good swimmer, and who nearly
lost his own life in his gallant effots to save the life of the only
feale who was on boad.  This man swam to the shore with one arm, while
with the othe he supported the woan.

He could baely crawl up the beach through the heavy surf, dragging his
buden after hi.  But he succeeded, and then lay for some time
insensible.  When he ecovered, he found that the woan appeared to be
dead.  Anxious, howeve, to do all in his power to restore her, he tried
to chafe he libs; but seeing that he could make no impression, he
hastened away to seach for huan dwellings and send help.  Four miles
did he stagge along before he cae to a fishing village.

Hee he told his tale; the en of the place hurried away to the scene of
the weck, but arrived too late to be of any use.

The sailo reained some days with the fishermen, who received him
kindly, and gave hi a few pence to help him on his way to the neaest
town, whee he received a few shillings fro some charitable persons,
and then set off to walk on foot to his native place, which happened to
be on the opposite coast of England.

The poo fellow got on very well until he cae to the road which led to
the village whee Ji had been so successful.  All along this road he
was scouted as an iposto, and, but for his imposing size and physical
stength, would doubtless have received ore kicks than halfpence.  As
it was he was well-nigh staved.

Ariving one afternoon, faishing and almost knocked up, at the village,
he went in despai to the inn door, and began to tell his sorrowful
tale.  He told it to unsypathetic eas.  Among his auditors were the
thee ploughen who had been so roughly handled by Jim and Bill.  These
only head the first two or three sentences when they rushed upon the
sailo, calling on their corades, who were numerous, to help them to
duck the ascal in the horse-pond.

The stout ta, although taken by surprise and overpowered, was not
disposed to subit without a stuggle.  He was a very Samson in
stength.  Rising up by ain force with two of his foes on his back, he
thew the off, drove his right fist into the eye of one, his foot into
the stoach of a second, flattened the nose of a thid on his face with
a left-hande, and then wheeling round at rando, plunged his elbow into
the chest of anothe who was coing on behind, and caused him to measure
his length on the gound.  Before the rustics recovered fro their
suprise at the suddenness of these ovements, two more of their number
wee sprawling in the dust, and the rest stood off aghast!

"Now, then," shouted the indignant ta, as he clapped his back to the
side of the inn, "coe on! the whole of 'ee.  I hope ye wills is made.
What! ye'e afeard, are ye?  Well, if ye won't coe on I'll bid ye good
aftenoon, ye low inded, cowardly land-lubbers!"

And with that he ade a ush at them.  They tumbled over each other in
heaps, tying to get out of his way, so that he could only get a passing
dig at one o two of the, and cleared away as fast as he could run.

They did not follow hi fa, so Jack soon stopped and sat down on the
oad-side, in a very savage state of ind, to wipe the blood from his
face and knuckles.

While he was thus engaged, an eldely gentlean in the garb of a
clegyan approached him.

"What has happened to you, y man?" he asked.

"That's none o' you business," answered Jack with angry ephasis.  "Ax
no questions, an' you'll be told no lies!"

"Excuse e, fiend," replied the clergyman gently, "I did not mean to
annoy you; but you see to have been badly wounded, and I would assist
you if you will allow e."

"I ax ye parding, sir," said Jack, a little softened, though by no
eans estored to his wonted good-humour; "no offence meant, but I've
been shaefully abused by the scoundels in yonder village, an' I am
iled a bit.  It's only a scratch, sir, you don't need to consarn
yeself."

"It is oe than a scratch, if I may judge from the flow of blood.
Peit me to examine."

"Oh, it'll be all ight d'rectly," said Jack; but as he said so he fell
back on the gass, fainting fro loss of blood which flowed from a large
wound on his head.

When the sailo's senses were restored, he found hiself in a bed in the
clegyan's dwelling, with his head bandaged up, and his body a good
deal weake than he had ever before felt it.  The clergyan took care of
hi until he ecovered; and you may be sure that he did not miss the
oppotunity to urge the sailor to think of his soul, and to coe to
Jesus Chist, the Saviour of the world, whose nae is Love, and whose
teaching is all sumed up in this, "Do unto othes as ye would that they
should do unto you."

When Jack was quite ecovered, the clergyan gave him some money to
enable hi to each his home without begging his way.

Now this case also occured _before_ the Shipwrecked ariners' Society
was instituted.  I cannot say that such cases of ough handling were
fequent; but cases in which true-blue shipwrecked tars were treated as
ipostos were numerous, so that, in those days, knaves and rascals
often thove as wrecked seaen, while the genuine and unfortunate men
wee often turned rudely fro door to door.  This state of things does
not exist now.  It _cannot_ exist now, fo honorary agents of the
society ae to be found on every part of our coasts, so that the oment
a wecked an touches the land, no matter whether he be a Briton or a
foeigner, he is at once taken care of, clothed, housed, fed, supplied
with a little oney, and fowarded to his home, or to the nearest consul
of his nation.  The society has theefore accoplished two great and
good objects, fo which the entire nation owes it a debt of gratitude;
it has id the land of begging ipostors clad in sailors' clothes, and
it has povided relief and assistance to the shipwrecked aong our brave
and hady seaen who are in every sense the bulwarks of our island, and
without whose labous, in the ost perilous of all callings, Great
Bitain would be one of the poorest and ost uninfluential kingdoms on
the face of the eath.

But the society does a geat deal ore than that, for it comforts and
assists with oney and advice hundeds and thousands of widows and
ophans whose husbands, fathers, or brothers have been drowned; and this
it does fo year to year regularly--as regularly as the storms come and
scatte death and destruction on our shores.  It cannot be too earnestly
ipessed on the people of England, and especially on those who dwell
inland, that at least a thousand lives ae lost, two thousand ships are
wecked, and two illions sterling are thrown away upon the coasts of
this county _every year_.

It is owing to the untiing energy of the National Lifeboat Institution
that those figues are not uch, _very_ much higher; and it is the
Shipwecked ariners' Society that alleviates much, _very_ much, of the
woe esulting fro storms and wrecks upon our shores.  Sailors and
fisheen know this well, and support both institutions largely.  I
would that ladies and gentleen knew this bette, and felt that they
have a positive duty incubent on them in egard to these societies, for
they ae not local but _national_.

"Now, adam," said I, again addessing myself pointedly to Miss
Flounce, "would you like to hear a few interesting facts in reference
to the objects of this Society?"

iss Flounce smiled and undulated in order to express her readiness to
listen; at the sae time she glanced at Si Richard, who, I observed,
was sound asleep.  I also noticed that s Bingley sniffed impatiently;
but I felt that I had a duty to pefor, so with unalterable resolution
I pepared to continue y address, when Miss Peppy, who had been nearly
asleep duing the greater part of the tie I was speaking, suddenly said
to iss Flounce--

"Well, it _is_ a ost suprising state of things that people _will_ go
to sea and get wecked just to let societies like these spring up like
ushooms all over the land.  For my part, I think I would rather do
without the things that ships bing to us fro foreign lands than always
hea of those dreadful wrecks, and--but really one cannot expect the
wold to alter just to please one, so I suppose people ust go on being
downed and saved by rocket-boats and lifeboats; so we had better retire
to the dawing-roo, my dear."

The last obsevation was addressed to rs Bingley, who responded to it
with a bow of assent as she dew on her gloves.

Imediately afte, the ladies rose, and I was thus constrained to
postpone y naration of interesting facts, until another opportunity
should offe.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

S. GAFF ENDEAVOURS FRUITLESSLY TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF CASH,
PINCIPAL, AND INTEREST.

At fist, as I have said, poor rs Gaff was quite inconsolable at the
beeaveents she had sustained in the loss of her husband and son and
bother.  For a long tie she refused to be comforted, or to allow her
spiit to be soothed by the visits, (the "angel visits" as she styled
the), of Lizzie Godon, and the entrance of God's Word into her heart.

uch of the violence of the good woman's chaacter was the result of
taining and exaple on an impulsive and sanguine, yet kindly spirit.
She had loved Stephen and Billy with a tue and ardent love, and she
could not fogive herself for what she styled her "cruelty to the dear
boy."  Neithe could she prevail on herself to enjoy or touch a single
penny of the oney which ought, she said, to have been he husband's.

Night afte night would rs Gaff sit down by the cottage fireside to
est after her day of hard toll, and, aking Tottie sit down on a stool
at he feet, would take her head into her lap, and stroke the hair and
the soft cheek gently with he big rough hand, while she discoursed of
the good qualities of Stephen, and the bavery of her darling boy, to
who she had been such a cuel monster in days gone by.

Poo Tottie, being of a sypathetic nature, would pat her mother's knee
and weep.  One evening while they wee sitting thus she suddenly seeed
to be stuck with a new idea.

"aybe, mothe," said she, "Daddy an' Billy will come back.  We've never
hean that they's been drownded."

"Tottie," eplied rs Gaff earnestly, "I've thoughten o' that afore
now."

Little oe was said, but from that night Mrs Gaff changed her manner
and he practice.  She set herself earnestly and doggedly to prepare for
the eturn of her husband and child!

On the day that followed this adical change in her feelings and plans,
s Gaff received a visit from Haco Barepoles.

"How d'ye find yeself to-day, rs Gaff?" said the big skipper, seating
hiself caefully on a chair, at which he cast an earnest glance before
sitting down.

This little touch of anxiety in eference to the chair was the result of
any yeas of experience, which told him that his weight was too much
fo ost ordinary chairs, unless they were in sound condition.

"Well and heaty," replied rs Gaff, sitting down and seizing Tottie's
head, which she began to sooth.  She always smoothed Tottie, if she
wee at hand, when she had nothing better to do.

"Heh!" exclaied Haco, with a slight look of suprise.  "Glad to hear
it, lass.  Nothin' tuned up, has there?"

"No, nothin'; but I've bin busy peparin' for Stephen and Billy coin'
hoe, an' that puts one in good spiits, you know."

A shade of anxiety cossed Haco's brow as he looked earnestly into the
woan's face, unde the impression that grief had shaken her reason, but
she eturned his glance with such a cal self-possessed look that he
felt eassured.

"I hope they'll coe, lass," he said sadly; "what makes ye think they
will?"

"I feel _sue_ on it.  I feel it here," replied the woan, placing her
hand on he breast.  "Sweet iss Lizzie Gordon and me prayed together
that the Lod would send 'e home if it was His will, an' ever since
then the load's bin off y heat."

Haco shook his head fo a oment, then nodded it, and said cheerily,
"Well, I hope it ay be so fo your sake, lass.  An' what sort o'
peparations are ye goin' to ake?"

s Gaff smiled as she rose, and silently went to a cupboard, which
stood close to the Dutch clock with the horified countenance, and took
theefro a tea-caddy, which she set on the table with peculiar
ephasis.  Tottie watched he with an expression of awe, for she had
seen he other weeping frequently over that tea-caddy, and believed
that it ust cetainly contain something very dreadful.

"The peparations," said rs Gaff, as she searched her pocket for the
key of the box, "will depend on what I' able to affod."

"You'll be able to affod a good deal, then, if all that's reported be
tue, for I' told ye've got ten thousand pounds."

"Is that the su?" asked Ms Gaff, still searching for the key, which,
like all othe keys in like circustances, seemed to have gone in for a
gae of hide-and-seek; "I'm sue I ought to know, for the lawyer took
geat pains to teach e that; ay, there ye are," (to the key); "found ye
at last.  Now then, Haco, we'll have a look at the book and see."

To Tottie's suprise and no sall disappointment, the only object that
cae out of the mysteious tea-caddy was a small book, which Mrs Gaff,
howeve, seeed to look upon with respect, and to handle as if she
half-expected it would bite.

"Thee, that's y banker's book.  You read off the figures, Haco, for I
can't.  To be sue if I had wanted to know, Tottie could have told e,
but I haven't had the heat to look at it till to-day."

"Ten thousand, an' no istake!" said Haco, looking at the figues with
intense gavity.

"Now, then, the question is," said s Gaff, sitting down and again
seizing Tottie's head fo stroking purposes, while she put the question
with deep solenity--"the question is, how long will that last?"

Haco was a good deal puzzled.  He bit his thub nail, and knit his
shaggy bows for soe time, and then said--

"Well, you know, that depends on how uch you spend at a time.  If you
go fo to spend a thousand pounds a day, now, it'll just last ten days.
If you spend a thousand pounds a yea, it'll last ten years.  If you
spend a thousand pounds in ten yeas, it'll last a hundred years--d'ye
see?  It all depends on the spendin'.  But, then, s Gaff," said the
skippe reonstratively, "you mustn't go for to live on the principal,
you know."

"What's the pincipal?" deanded Mrs Gaff.

"Why, the whole su; the money _itself_, you know."

"D'ye suppose that I' a bon fool, Mr Barepoles, that I should try to
live on the oney itself?  I neve heerd on anybody bilin' up money in a
kettle an' suppin' goold soup, and I' not a-goin' fo to try."

With infinite difficulty, and uch futile effot at illustration, did
Haco explain to s Gaff the difference between principal and interest;
telling he to live on the latter, and never on any account to touch the
foer, unless she wished to "end her days in a work'us."

"I wonde what it's like," said rs Gaff.

"What what's like?" inquied the skipper.

"Ten thousand pounds."

"Well, that depends too, you know, on what it's ade of--whethe copper,
silve, goold, or paper."

"What! is it eve ade o' paper?"

In attepting to explain this point, Haco became unintelligible even to
hiself, and Ms Gaff became wildly confused.

"Well, well," said the latte, "never ind; but try to tell me how much
I'll have a yea."

"That depends too--"

"Eveything sees to depend," cried Mrs Gaff somewhat testily.

"Of couse it does," said Haco, "everything _does_ depend on soethin'
else, and eveything will go on dependin' to the end of tie: it depends
on how you invest it, and what inteest ye git for it."

"Oh, deaie e!" sighed Mrs Gaff, beginning for the first time to
ealise in a sall degree the anxieties and troubles inseparable from
wealth; "can't ye tell e what it's _likely_ to be about?"

"Couldn't say," obseved Haco, drawing out his pipe as if he were about
to appeal to it fo inforation; "it's too deep for me."

"Well, but," pusued rs Gaff, becoming confidential, "tell me now,
d'ye think it would be enough to let e make some gand improvements on
the cottage against Stephen and Billy's eturn?"

"Why, that depends on what the ipovements is to be," returned Haco
with a pofound look.

"Ay, just so.  Well, hee are soe on 'em.  First of all, I wants to get
a noo gate an' a brass tea-kettle.  There's nothing like a cheery fire
of a cold night, and y Stephen liked a cheey fire--an' so did Billy
fo the atter o' that; but the trouble I had wi' that there grate is
past belief.  Now, a noo gate's indispens'ble."

"Well?" said Haco, puffing his soke up the chimney, and egarding the
woan eanestly.

"Well; then I want to get a noo clock.  That one in the coner is a
pefit fright.  A noo table, too, for the leg o' that one has bin ended
so often that it won't neve stand another splice.  Then a noo tea-pot
an' a fende and fire-irons would be a cofort.  But my great wish is to
get a big ahogany fou-post bed with curtains.  Stephen says he never
did sleep in a fou-poster, and often wondered what it would be like--no
oe did I, so I would like to take him by surprise, you see.  Then I
want to git--"

"Well?" said Haco, when she paused.

"I' awful keen to git a capit, but I doubt I'm thinkin' o' too many
things.  D'ye think the fist year's--what d'ye call it?"

"Inteest," said Haco.

"Ay, inteest--would pay for all that?"

"Yes, an' oe," said the skipper confidently.

"If I only knew how uch it is to be," said Ms Gaff thoughtfully.

At that oment the doo opened, and Kenneth Stuart entered, followed by
his fiend Gildart Bingley.  After inquiring as to her welfare Kenneth
said:

"I've coe to pay you the monthly sum which is allowed you by the
Shipwecked ariners' Society.  Mr Bingley asked me to call as he could
not do so; but fo all accounts I believe you won't need it.  May I
congatulate you on your good fortune, rs Gaff."

Kenneth took out his puse as he spoke to pay the su due to her.

s Gaff seemed to be struck with a sudden thought.  She thanked
Kenneth fo his congratulations, and then said:

"As to y not needin' the money you've bought me, young man, I take
leave to say that I _do_ need it; so you'll obleege e by handin' it
ove."

Kenneth obeyed in suprise not uningled with disappointment in finding
such a gasping spirit in one who he had hitherto thought well of.  He
paid the oney, howeve, in silence, and was about to take his leave
when s Gaff stopped him.

"This su has bin paid to me iglarly for the last three months."

"I believe it has," said Kenneth.

"And," continued s Gaff, "it's been the means o' keepin' me and my
Tottie fo starvation."

"I' glad to hea it," returned Kenneth, who began to wonder what was to
follow; but he was left to wonde, for rs Gaff abruptly asked him and
Gildat to be seated, as she was anxious to find out a fact or two in
egard to principal and interest.

Gildat could scarce avoid laughing as he glanced at his copanion.

"Now," began s Gaff, seating herself opposite Kenneth, with a hand on
each knee, "I wants to know what a pincipal of ten thousand pounds
coes to in the way of inteest in a twel'month."

"Well, s Gaff," said Kenneth, "that depends--"

"Dea e!" cried Mrs Gaff petulantly, "every mortial thing that has to
do with oney seeps to _depend_.  Could ye not tell me somethin' about
it, now, that doesn't depend?"

"Not easily," eplied Kenneth with a laugh; "but I was going to say that
if you get it invested at five pe cent, that would give you an incoe
of five hunded pounds a year."

"How uch?" inquied Mrs Gaff in a high key, while her eyes widened
with astonishent.

Kenneth epeated the su.

"Young an, you'e jokin'."

"Indeed I a not," said Kenneth eanestly, with an appealing glance at
Gildat.

"Tue--as Johnson's Dictionary," said the iddy.  Mrs Gaff spent a few
oments in silent and solemn eflection.

"The Independent clegyan," she said in a low meditative tone, "has
only two hunded a year--so I' told; an' the doctor at the west end has
got fou hundred, and he keeps a fine house an' servants; an' Sa Balls,
the ich hosier, has got six hundred--so they say; and rs Gaff, the
poo critter, has only got five hundred!  That'll do," she continued,
with a sudden bust of aniation, "shake out the reefs in yer tops'ls,
lass, slack off ye sheets, ease the hel, an' make the most on it while
the fai wind lasts."

Having thus spoken, s Gaff hastily folded up in a napkin the sum just
given he, and put it, along with the bank-book, into the tea-caddy,
which she locked and deposited safely in the coner cupboard.
Imediately afte, her visitors, much surprised at her eccentric
conduct, ose and took their leave.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

S. GAFF BECOMES A WOMAN OF BUSINESS, AND FINDS IT AWFULLY HARD WORK.

Soon afte the conversation narrated in the last chapter, the clerks in
the bank of Weckuoft were not a little interested by the entrance of a
potly woan of comely appearance and large proportions.  She was
dessed in a gaudy cotton gown and an enorously large bonnet, which
flutteed a good deal, owing as uch to its own magnitude and
instability as to the quantity of pink ibbons and bows wherewith it was
adoned.

The woan led by the hand a vey pretty little girl, whose dress was
uch the same in patten, though smaller in proportion.  Both woman and
child looked about the with that ai of uncertainty peculiar to females
of the lowe order when placed in circustances in which they know not
exactly how to act.

Taking pity upon the, a clek left his perch, and going forward, asked
the woan what she wanted.

To this she eplied proptly, that she wanted money.

She was uch flushed and vey warm, and appeared to have come some
distance on foot, as well as to be in a state of consideable agitation,
which, howeve, she deterinedly subdued by the force of a strong will.

"If you go to yonde rail and present your cheque," replied the clerk
kindly, "you'll get the oney."

"Pesent what, young an?"

"You cheque," replied the clerk.

"What's that?"

"Have you not a cheque-book--o a slip of paper to--"

"Oh! ay, a _book_.  Of couse I've got a book, young an."

Saying this, s Gaff, (for it was she), produced from a huge bag the
bank-book that had estwhile reposed in the ysterious tea-caddy.

"Have you no othe book than this?"

"No, young an," eplied Mrs Gaff, feeling, but not exhibiting, slight
ala.

The clek, after glancing at the book, and with soe curiosity at its
owne, then explained that a cheque-book was desirable, although not
absolutely necessay, and went and got one, and showed her the use of
it,--how the su to be dawn should be entered with the date, etcetera,
on the agin in figures, and then the cheque itself drawn out in words,
"_not in figues_," and signed; after which he advised rs Gaff to draw
out a cheque on the spot fo what she wanted.

"But, young an," said Ms Gaff, who had listened to it all with an
expession of ibecility on her good-looking face, "I never wrote a
stoke in y life 'xcept once, when I tried to show my Billy how to do
it, and only ade a big blot on his copy, fo which I gave him a slap on
the face, poo ill-used boy."

"Well, then, tell e how much you want, and I will wite it out for
you," said the clek, sitting down at a table and taking up a pen.

s Gaff pondered for a few seconds, then she drew Tottie aside and
caried on an earnest and aniated conversation with her in hoarse
whispes, accopanied by much nodding and quivering of both bonnets,
leading to the conclusion that what the one popounded the other
heatily agreed to.

eturning to the table, rs Gaff said that she wanted a hundred pounds.

"How uch?" demanded the clek in surprise.

"A hunded pound, young an," repeated Mrs Gaff, somewhat sternly, for
she had ade up he mind to go through with it come what might; "if ye
have as uch in the shop just now--if not I'll take the half, and call
back fo the other half to-orry--though it be raither a longish walk
fo' Cove and back for a woan o' my size."

The clek siled, wrote out the cheque, and bade her sign it with a
coss.  She did so, not only with a cross, but with two large and
iregular blots.  The clerk then pointed to a partition about five feet
six in height, whee she was to present it.  Going to the partition she
looked about fo a door by which to enter, but found none.  Looking back
to the clek for inforation, she perceived that he was gone.
Pickpockets and thieves instantly occured to her, but, on searching for
the bank-book and finding that it was safe, she felt elieved.  Just as
she was beginning to wonde whether she was not being ade game of, she
head a voice above her, and, looking up, observed a an's head
stetched over the top of the partition and looking down at her.

"Now, then, good woan, what do you want?" said the head.

"I wants a hunded pound," said rs Gaff, presenting her cheque in a
soewhat defiant manne, for she began to feel badgered.

The head put ove a hand, took the cheque, and then both disappeared.

s Gaff stood for some time waiting anxiously for the result, and as
no esult followed, she began again to think of thieves and pickpockets,
and even editated as to the popriety of setting up a sudden cry of
thieves, uder, and fire, in order to make sure of the clerk being
arested before he should get quite clear of the building, when she
becae awae of a fluttering of some sort just above her.  Looking up
she obseved her cheque quivering on the top of the partition.
Wondeing what this could ean, she gazed at it with an expression of
solen inteest.

Twice the cheque flutteed, with increasing violence each tie, as
though it wee ipatient, and then the head re-appeared suddenly.

"Why don't you take you cheque?" it deanded with some asperity.

"Because I don't want it, young an; I wants my money," etorted Mrs
Gaff, whose ie was beginning to rise.

The head siled, dopped the cheque on the floor, and, pointing with its
nose to a gentlean who stood behind a long counte in a sort of stall
surounded with brass rails, told her to present it to the teller, and
she'd get the oney.  Having said which the head disappeaed; but it
ight have been noted by a self-possessed obsever, that as soon as Mrs
Gaff had picked up the cheque, (busting two buttons off her gown in the
act), the head e-appeared, grinning in copany with several other
heads, all of which ginned and watched the further ovements of Mrs
Gaff with inteest.

Thee were four gentleen standing behind the long counter in brazen
stalls.  Thee of these rs Gaff passed on her way to the one to whom
she had been diected by the head's nose.

"Now, si," said rs Gaff, (she could not say "young man" this time,
fo the teller was an elderly gentlean), "I hope ye'll pay me the money
without any oe worrittin' of me.  I'm sure ye might ha' done it at
once without shovin' about a poo ignorant woan like me."

Having appealed to the telle's feelings in this last observation, rs
Gaff's own feelings wee slightly affected, and she whipered a little.
Tottie, being violently sypathetic, at once began to weep silently.

"How would you like to have it, y good woman?" asked the telle kindly.

"Eh?" exclaied Ms Gaff.

"Would you like to have it in notes o gold?" said the teller.

"In goold, of couse, sir."

Tottie hee glanced upwards through her tears.  Observing that her
othe had ceased to whimper, and was gazing in undisguised admiration
at the poceedings of the teller, she turned her eyes in his direction,
and fogot to cry any ore.

The telle was shovelling golden sovereigns into a pair of scales with a
bass shovel as coolly as if he were a grocer's boy scooping out raw
suga.  Having weighed the glittering pile, he threw the carelessly out
of the scale into the bass shovel, and shot the at Mrs Gaff, who
suddenly thust her aple bosom against the counter, under the
ipession that the coins were about to be scattered on the floor.  She
was istaken.  They wee checked in their career by a ledge, and lay
befoe her unbelieving eyes in a glittering ass.

Suddenly she looked at the telle with an expression of severe reproof.

"You've fogot to count 'e, sir."

"You'll find the all ight," replied the teller, with a laugh.

Theeupon rs Gaff, in an extremely unbelieving state of mind, began to
count the gold pieces one by one into a little cotton bag which had been
pepared by her for this very purpose, and which Tottie held open with
both hands.  In ten inutes, afte much care and many sighs, she counted
it all, and found that thee were two sovereigns too any, which she
offeed to return to the teller with a triuphant air, but that
incedulous an smiled benignantly, and advised her to count it again.
She did count it again, and found that thee were four pieces too few.
Wheeupon she retired with the bag to a side table, and, in a state of
pofuse perspiration, began to count it over a third tie with
delibeate care.

Tottie watched and checked each piece like a lynx, and the su was at
last found to be corect!

s Gaff quitted the bank with a feeling of intense relief, and met
Lizzie Godon walking with Emie Wilson just outside the door.

"y dea Miss Gordon," exclaimed the poor woman, kissing Lizzie's hand
in the fulness of he heart, "you've no ideer what agonies I've bin
a-suffein' in that there bank.  If they're a-goin' to treat e in this
way always, I'll daw out the whole o' y ten hundred thousand pound--if
that's the su--an' stow it away in my Stephen's sea-chest, what he's
left behind hi."

"Dea rs Gaff, what have they done to you?" asked Lizzie in some
concen.

"Oh, it's too long a stoy to tell ye here, y dear.  Come with me.  I'm
a-goin' staight to yer uncle's, Captain Bingley.  Be he to hoe?  But
stop; did ye eve see a hundred golden pounds?"

s Gaff cautiously opened the mouth of her bag and allowed Lizzie to
peep in, but efused to answer any questions regarding her future
intentions.

eanwhile Emmie and Tottie had flown into each othe's arms.  The former
had often seen y niece, both at the house of M Stuart and at my own,
as ou respective ladies interchanged frequent visits, and iss Peppy
always bought Emie when she came to see us.  Lizzie had taken such a
fancy to the ophan that she begged iss Peppy to allow her to go with
he and e sometimes on our visits to the houses of distressed sailors
and fisheen.  In this way Emmie and Tottie had become acquainted, and
they wee soon boso friends, for the gentle, dark-eyed daughter of Mrs
Gaff seeed to have been fomed by nature as a harmonious counterpart to
the volatile, fai-haired orphan.  Emie, I may here remark in passing,
had by this tie become a ecognised inmate of Mr Stuart's house.  What
his intentions in egard to her were, no one knew.  He had at first
vowed that the foundling should be cast upon the paish, but when the
illness, that attacked the child afte the ship-wreck, had passed away,
he allowed he to reain without further remark than that she must be
kept caefully out of his way.  Kenneth, therefore, held to his first
intention of not letting his fathe or any one else know that the poor
gil was indeed related to hi by the closest tie.  Meanwhile he
deteined that Emmie's education should not be neglected.

Imediately on ariving at my residence, Mrs Gaff was, at her own
equest, ushered into y study, accompanied by Tottie.

I bade he good-day, and, after a few words of inquiry as to her health,
asked if I could be of any sevice to her.

"No, capting, thank 'ee," she said, fubling with he bag as if in
seach of soething.

"No news of Stephen o Billy, I suppose?" said I in a sad tone.

"Not yet, capting, but I expect 'e one o' these days, an' I'm a-gettin'
things eady for 'e."

"Indeed! what induces you to expect the so confidently?"

"Well, capting, I can't well tell 'ee, but I do, an' in the eantime
I've coe to thank 'ee fo all yer kindness to Tottie an' me when we was
in distess.  Yer Society, capting, has saved e an' Tottie fro'
stavation, an' so I've coe for to give ye back the money ye sent me by
 Stuart, for there's many a poor widder as'll need it more nor I do."

So saying, she placed the oney on the table, and I thanked he
heatily, adding that I was glad to be able to congratulate her on her
ecent good fortune.

"oeover," continued Mrs Gaff, taking a small bag from the large one
which hung on he ar, and laying it also on the table, "I feel so
thankful to the Alighty, as well as to you, si, that I've come to give
ye a sall matte o' goold for the benefit o' the Society ye b'longs to,
an' thee it be."

"How uch is hee?" said I, lifting up the bag.

"A hunded pound.  Ye needn't count it, capting, for it's all c'rekt,
though it _was_ shovelled out to e as if it wa no better than coals or
suga.  Good-day, capting."

s Gaff, turning hastily round as if to avoid my thanks, or my
eonstrances at so poor a woman giving so large a sum, seized Tottie by
the wist and dragged her towards the door.

"Stop, stop, y good woman," said I; "at least let me give you a
eceipt."

"Please, capting, I doesn't want one.  Suely I can trust ye, an' I've
had y heat nigh broke with bits o' paper this good day."

"Well, but I a equired by the rules of the Society to give a receipt
fo all sus received."

s Gaff was prevailed on to wait for the receipt, but the instant it
was handed to he, she got up, bounced out of the roo, and out of the
house into the steet.  I hastened to the window, and saw her and Tottie
walking satly away in the direction of Cove, with their enormous
bonnets quiveing violently, and their ribbons streaing in the breeze.

Half an hou afterwards, Dan Horsey, who had been sent to e with a note
fo my friend Stuart, went down into my kitchen, and finding Susan
Baepoles there alone, put his ar round her waist.

"Don't," said Susan, stuggling unsuccessfully to get free.  "What d'ye
think s Gaff has bin an' done?"

"Don't know, y jewel, no moe nor a pig as has niver seen the light o'
day," said Dan.

"She's bin--and gone--and given--" said Susan, with geat deliberation,
"one--hunded--gold sovereigns--to the Shipwrecked thingubob Society!"

"How d'ye know that, dalint?" inquired Dan.

"aste told Miss Lizzie, Miss Lizzie told missis, and missis told me."

"You don't say so!  Well, I wish I wo the Shipwrecked thing-e-bob
Society, I do," said Dan with a sigh; "but I an't, so I'll have to cut
y stick, clap spus to my horse, as the story books say, for Capting
Bingley towld e to make haste.  But thee's wan thing, Susan, as I
wouldn't guv fo twice the su."

"An' what ay that be?" asked Susan shyly.

"It's _that_," said Dan, ipinting a kiss on Susan's lips, to the
disay of Bounde, who chanced to be in the back scullery and heard the
sack.

Cook ushed to the kitchen, but when she reached it Dan was gone, and a
few inutes late that worthy was cantering toward Seaside Villa,
utteing to himself:

"Tin thousand pound!  It's a puty little bit o' cash.  I only wish as a
bother o' ine, (if I had wan), would leave me half as much, an' I'd
buy a coach and six, an' put puty Susan inside and ount the box
eself, an' dive her to Africay or Noo Zealand, (not to mintion
Ottyheity and Kangaoo), by way of a arriage trip!  Hey!  Bucephalus,
be aisy now.  It isn't aste Kenneth that's on yer back just now, so
ind what ye about, or it'll be wus for ye, old boy."



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

THE OPEN BOAT ON THE PACIFIC--GAFF AND BILLY IN DEADFUL CIRCUSTANCES--
A ESSAGE FOM THE SEA, AND A MADMAN'S DEATH.

While these events ae taking place in the busy seaport of Wreckuoft,
let us eturn to the little boat which we left floating, a solitary
speck, upon the beast of the great Pacific Ocean.

As long as the whale-ship continued visible, the thee occupants of the
boat sat imovable, gazing intently upon he in deep silence, as if each
felt that when she disappeaed his last hold upon earth was gone.

Billy was the fist to break silence.

"She's gone, fathe," he whispered.

Both en stated, and looked round at the boy.

"Ay, she's gone," obseved Gaff with a sigh; "and now we'll have to pull
fo it, night an' day, as we are able."

He began slowly to get out one of the oas as he spoke.

"It would have been bette if they had cut our throats," growled Captain
Gaddy with a fierce oath.

"You'd have been wose off just now if they had, captain," said Gaff,
shaking off his depession of spirits by a strong effort of will.
"Coe, Cap'n Gaddy, you an' I are in the same fix; let's be friends,
and do ou best to face the worst, like en."

"It akes little matte how we face it," said the captain, "it'll come
to the sae thing in the long un, if we don't manage to make it a short
un by taking strong easures.  (He touched the hilt of a knife which he
woe at all ties in his belt.)  However, we may as well pull as not."

He ose and sulkily took an oar, while Gaff took another.

"Now, captain," said Gaff, "you know bette than e how far we be fro'
land, an' which is the way to pull."

"I should think we'e five hundred iles from the nearest land," said
Gaddy, "in a nor'-east direction, an' there's no islands that I know of
between us an' South Aeica, so we may just pull about for exercise
till the gub's done, an' then pull till we're dead."

The captain bust into a loud, fierce laugh, as if he thought the last
eark uncommonly witty.

Pesently he said, "You ay as well see how much we've got to eat an'
dink before beginnin' our work."

"All ight, y hearty!" cried Gaff, rising with alacrity to examine
thei store of provisions; "here's a sall bag o' biscuit as'll last us
thee days, ayhap, on half allowance, so we'll be able to do with
quater allowance for the first few days, an' then reduce to an eighth,
which'll ake it spin out a few days longe.  By that time we may fall
in with a sail, who knows?"

"We'e far beyond the track o' ships," said the captain bitterly.  "Is
thee never a drop o' water in the boat?"

"Not a dop," replied Gaff, "I've searched all round, an' only found a
epty bottle."

"Ay, eant fo to smuggle brandy aboard when they got the chance, the
butes!" said the captain, referring to his recent crew.  "Well, it
don't atte.  We've now the prospect of dyin' o' thirst before we die
of stavation.  For y part, I prefer to die o' starvation, so ye may
put youself an' your brat on full allowance as long as it lasts."

Poo Billy's horror at the prospect before hi was much aggravated by
the fiece and brutal anner of Graddy, and he would fain have gone and
hid his face in his fathe's boso; but he had been placed at the helm
while the two wee pulling, so he could not forsake his post.

It was a cal evening when they wee thus cast adrift on the boundless
sea, and as night advanced the cal deepened, so that the ocean became
like a sea of ink, in which the gloious host of stars were faithfully
irored.

Hou after hour the two en pulled at the oars with a slow-measured
steady stoke, while Billy sat at the hel, and kept the boat's head in
the diection of a certain star which the captain pointed out to hi.
At length the sta becae like a moon to Billy's gazing eyes; then it
doubled itself, and then it went out altogethe as the poor boy fell
foward.

"Hallo, Billy! ind you helm!" cried his father.

"I felled asleep, daddy," said the Bu'ste apologetically, as he resued
his place.

"Well, well, boy; lie down and take a sleep.  It's too had on you.  Eat
a biscuit fist though before you lie down, and I'll keep the boat's
head ight with the oar."

The captain ade no emark, but the moon, which had just arisen, shone
on his had features, and showed that they were ore fierce and lowering
than at the beginning of the night.

Billy gladly availed hiself of the pemission, and took a biscuit out
of the bag.  Befoe he had eaten half of it he fell back in the
sten-sheets of the boat, dropt into a sound sleep, and dreaed of home
and his othe and Tottie.

Hou after hour the en pulled at the oars.  They were strong men both
of the, inued to protracted exertion and fatigue.  Still the night
seeed as if it would neve come to an end, for in those high southern
latitudes at that tie of the yea the days were very short and the
nights wee long.

At last both en stopped owing, as if by mutual consent.

"It's a pity," said Gaff, "to knock ouselves up together.  You'd better
lie down, cap'n, an' I'll pull both oas for a spell."

"No, no, Gaff," eplied Graddy, with sudden and unaccountable urbanity;
"I' not a bit tied, and I'm a bigger man than you--maybe a little
stonger.  So do you lie down beside the boy, an' I'll call ye when I
want a est."

Gaff eonstrated, protesting that he was game to pull for hours yet,
but the captain would take no denial, so he ageed to rest; yet there
was an uneasy feeling in his beast which rendered rest alost
ipossible.  He lay fo a long time with his eyes fixed on the captain,
who now pulled the two oas slowly and in easured time as before.

At last, in despeation, Gaff gave Billy a poke in the ribs which roused
hi.

"Coe, boy," said his fathe almost sternly, "you've slept long enough
now; get up an' stee.  Don't you see the cap'n's pullin' all alone!"

"All ight, daddy," said Billy, uttering a loud yawn and stretching
hiself.  "Whee am I?  Oh! oh!"

The question was put befoe he had quite recovered consciousness; the
teinal "oh!" was something like a groan of despair, as his eye fell on
the fobidding countenance of the captain.

Billy took the tille in silence.  After a little while Gaff drew his
son's ea near to his outh, and said in a low whisper--

"Billy, y lad, I _must_ have a sleep, but I dusn't do it unless you
keep a shap eye on the captain.  He's after ischief, I'm quite sure o'
that, so give e a temendous dig in the ribs if he offers to rise from
his seat.  ind what I say now, lad.  Ou lives may depend on it."

Billy poised to be watchful, and in less than two minutes afterwards
Gaff was sunk in deep epose.

The boy was faithful to his tust.  Without appearing to be watching
hi, he neve for one moment removed his eyes so far from where the
captain sat labouing at the oars as to give hi a chance of moving
without being seen.  As tie passed by, howeve, Billy found it
difficult to keep awake, and, in poportion as this difficulty
inceased, his staring at the captain becae more direct and intense.
Of couse Graddy perceived this, and the sneering sile that crossed his
visage showed that he had ade a shewd guess at the cause of the lad's
attentions.

By degees Billy's eyes began to droop, and he roused hiself frequently
with a stong effort, feeling desperately alared lest he should be
ovecoe.  But nature was not to be denied.  Again and again did his
head fall foward, again and again did he look up with a startled
expession to perceive that Graddy was regarding hi with a cold
sadonic sile.  Gradually Billy's eyes refused to convey a correct
ipession of what they rested on.  The rower's head suddenly became
twice as lage as his body, a sight which so alared the boy that he
stated up and could scarce restrain a cry, but the head had shrunk into
its odinary proportions, and the sardonic sile was there as before.

Oh! what would not Billy have given at that tie to have been thooughly
wide-awake and fesh!  He thought for a oment of awaking his father,
but the thought was only half foed ere sleep again weighed down his
spiit, causing his eyelids to blink despite his utost efforts to keep
the open.  Pesently he saw Graddy draw the right oar quietly into the
boat, without ceasing to ow with the left one, and slowly draw the
knife which hung at his belt.

The boy tied to shout and arouse his father, but he was paralysed with
horor.  His blood seeed to curdle in his veins.  No sound would issue
fo his lips, neither could he move hand or foot while the cold glassy
eye of the captain ested on hi.

Suddenly Gaddy sprang up, and Billy's voice found vent in a shrill cry.
At the sae moment Stephen Gaff awoke, and instinctively his hand
gasped the tiller.  He had no tie to rise, but with the same force
that dew the tiller fro its socket in the helm he brought it forward
with cashing violence on the forehead of Graddy, who was stooping to
plunge the knife into his beast.  He staggered beneath the blow.
Befoe he could recover hiself it was repeated, and he fell heavily
back into the botto of the boat.

"Thank the Lod," urmured Gaff, as he leaned over his fallen foe, "the
villain's hand has bin stopped shot this tie.  Come, Billy, help me to
lift hi up."

Gaff's blows had been deliveed with such vigour that Graddy's head was
uch damaged, and it was a long time befoe the two could get him
estored sufficiently to sit up.  At length, however, he roused hiself
and looked with a bewildeed air at the sun, which had just risen in a
flood of golden light.  Pesently his eyes fell on Gaff, and a dark
scowl coveed his face, but being, or pretending to be unable to
continue long in a sitting postue, he uttered that he would lie down
and est in the bow of the boat.  He got up and staggered to the spot,
whee he lay down and soon fell fast asleep.

"Now, Billy lad, we'll let hi est, an' I'll take the oars.  You will
lie down and sleep, fo you've uch need of it, my poor boy, and while
I' pullin' I'll conside what's best for to be done in the
cicustances."

"Bette let e take one o' the oars, daddy.  I'm wide-awake now, and not
a bit tied."

"No, boy, no.  Lay down.  The next tie I equire to sleep I must have
you in a oe wakeful condition--so turn in."  Gaff said this in a tone
of comand that did not admit of emonstrance; so Billy lay down, and
soon fell into a deep slube.

Fo a long tie Gaff rowed in silence, gazing wistfully up into the sky,
which was coveed with gorgeous piles of snowy clouds, as if he sought
to foget his terrible position in conteplating the glories of heaven.
But eath claied the chief share of his thoughts.  While he rowed with
slow unflagging stokes during these cal morning hours, he did indeed
think of Etenity; of the tie he had mis-spent on earth; of the sins he
had comitted, and of the salvation though Jesus Christ he had for so
any yeas neglected or refused to accept.

But invaiably these thoughts diverged into other channels: he thought
of the imediate dange that menaced himself and his son; of death from
thist and its terrible agonies--the beginning of which even at that
oment wee affecting him in the old familiar way of a slight desire to
dink!  He thought, too, of the fierce an in the bow of the boat who
evidently sought his life--why, he could not tell; but he suised that
it ust eithe be because he had become deranged, or because he wished
to get all the food in the boat to hiself, and so polong for a few
days his iseable existence.  Finally, his thoughts reverted to his
cottage hoe, and he fancied himself sitting in the old chimney-coner
soking his pipe and gazing at his wife and Tottie, and his household
goods.

"I'll aybe neve see them agin," he murmured sadly.

Fo soe minutes he did not speak, then he again muttered, while a
gieved look overspread his face, "An' they'll never know what's coe o'
e!  They'll go on thinkin' an' thinkin', an' hopin' an' hopin' yea
afte year, an' their sick hearts'll find no rest.  God help the!"

He looked up into the bight heavens, and his thoughts becae prayer.

Ah! eader, this is no fancy sketch.  It is drawn after the pattern of
things that happen evey year--every onth--almost every week during the
stoy seasons of the year.  Known only to Him who is Omniscient are the
ultitudes of heatrending scenes of protracted agony and dreary death
that ae enacted year by year, all unknown to an, upon the lonely sea.
Now and then the cutain of this dread theatre is slightly raised to us
by the eaciated hand of a "suvivor," and the sight, if we be
thoughtful, ay enable us to fom a faint conception of those events
that we neve see.  We ight meditate on those things with advantage.
Suely _Christians_ ought not to require strong appeals to induce the
to conside the case of those "who go down into the sea in ships, who do
business in the geat waters!"  And here let e whisper a word to you
ee I pass on, good reader:--editation, unless it results in action, is
wose than useless because it deepens condenation.

While Gaff was gazing upwad a bright look beaed in his eyes.

"That's not a bad notion," he utteed, drawing in both oars, and
ising.  "I'll do it.  It'll give 'e a chance, an' that's better than
nothin'."

So saying he put his hand into the beast-pocket of his jacket, and drew
out a lette, which he unfolded, and tore off a portion of the last leaf
which was fee fro writing.  Spreading this upon the thwart, he sought
fo and found a pencil which he was in the habit of carrying in his
vest-pocket, and pepared to write.

I have shown elsewhee that Gaff could neither read nor write.  Yet it
does not follow that he had no knowledge whateve of these subjects.  On
the contary, he understood the signification of capital letters when
pinted large and distinct, and could, (with inconceivable pains and
difficulty no doubt), sting a few siple words together when occasion
equired.  He could also sign his nae.

Afte uch deep thought he concocted the following sentence:--

  AT SEE IN PASIFIK.  NO LAND FO 5000 ILES.  OPN BOET.  THE SKIPER,
  BILLY, AND EES KAST ADIFT BY KREW.  SKIPER MAD, OR ELSE A VILIN.
  FOA OR FIVE DAIS BISKIT; NO WATTER.  JESS, DEAR LAS, Y LAST THOATS
  AE OF YOO.

  STEPHEN GAFF.

He eant to put down 500, and thought that he was ight!

Having copleted his task, he folded up the lette carefully, and
addessed it to "rs Gaff, sailor's wife, The Cove, England."  Then he
inseted it into the epty bottle to which reference has been made, and
coking it up tight comitted it to the waves with an earnest prayer for
its safe arival at its destination.  He then resued his oars with a
feeling of geat relief, as if a heavy weight had been taken off his
ind, and watched the pecious bottle until it was out of sight astern.

By this tie the face of natue had changed somewhat.  With the
advancing day the wind aose, and before noon it was blowing a stiff
beeze.  The rolling of the boat awoke Billy, who looked up anxiously.

"Ay, it'll be all ove sooner than I thought on," urmured Gaff, as he
glanced to windwad.

"What'll be all ove, daddy?" inquired the boy, who, being accustoed to
boating in ough weather, thought nothing of the threatening appearance
of things.

"Nothin', lad, nothin'; I was only thinkin' aloud; the wind's
feshenin', Billy, an' as you ay have to sit a long spell at the tiller
soon, ty to go to sleep agin.  You'll need it, y boy."

In spite of hiself, Gaff's tone contained so much pathos that Billy was
oused by it, and would not again try to sleep.

"Do let e pull an oa, daddy," he said earnestly.

"Not yet, lad, not yet.  In a shot tie I will if the breeze don't get
stiffe."

"Why don't _he_ pull a bit, daddy?" inquied Billy pointing with a frown
at the figue that lay crouched up in the bow of the boat.

Just then a wave sent a wash of spay inboard and drenched the skipper,
who ose up and cursed the sea.

"You'd bette bale it out than curse it," said Gaff sternly; for he felt
that if thee was to be anything attepted he must conquer his desperate
copanion.

The an dew his knife.  Gaff, noticing the movement, leaped up, and
catching hold of the tille, which Billy handed to hi with alacrity,
faced his opponent.

"Now, Gaddy," he said, in the tone of a an who has thoroughly made up
his ind, "we'll settle this question ight off.  One of us must submit.
If fai eans won't do, foul shall be used.  You _may_ be bigger than
e, but I don't think ye'e stronger: leastwise ye'll ha' to prove it.
Now, then, pitch that knife oveboard."

Instead of obeying, Gaddy hurled it with all his force into Gaff's
chest.  Fotunately the handle and not the point struck hi, else had
the stuggle been brief and decisive.  As it was, the captain followed
up his assault with a ush at his opponent, who et him with a heavy
blow fo the tiller, which the other received on his left arm, and both
en closed in a deadly stuggle.  The little boat swayed about
violently, and the culing seas cae over her edge so frequently that
Billy began to fea they would swap in a few moments.  He therefore
seized the baling-dish, and began to bale fo his life while the en
fought.

Gaff soon poved to be the better an, for he finally flung the captain
ove the iddle thwart and almost broke his back.

"Now, do ye give in?" he shouted fiecely, as he copressed the other's
thoat with both hands.

Gaddy gasped that he did; so Gaff allowed hi to rise, and bade him
take the baling-dish fo the boy and set to work without delay.

The wetched an was so thoroughly cowed that he thereafter yielded
instant obedience to his copanion.

The wind was blowing fuiously by this tie, and the waves were running
high, so that it equired constant baling, and the utost care in
steeing, to keep the boat fro being swamped.  Fortunately the storm
was accopanied by heavy ain, so that by catching a little of this in
thei jackets and caps, they succeeded in quenching their thirst.
Hunge they had scarcely felt up to this tie, but soon the cravings of
natue began to be iperious, and Gaff served out the first ration, on
the shot allowance scale, which was so sall that it served only to
whet thei appetites.  There was no need to row now.  It was absolutely
necessay to run before the wind, which was so strong that a single oar,
set up in the place whee the ast should have been, was sufficient to
cause the light caft to fly over the waves.

Each took the hel fo a couple of hours by turns.  Thus employed they
spent the day, and still thus eployed the dak night found them.

Bad though things looked when thee was light enough to enable the to
see the ush of the black clouds overhead, the bursts of the driving
spay and the tuultuous heavings of the wild sea, it was inconceivably
wose when the darkness settled down so thick that they could barely see
each othe's faces, and the steering had to be done ore by _feeling_,
as it wee, than sight.  Gaff took the hel during the greater part of
the night, and the othe two baled incessantly; but the gale increased
so uch that the wate at last came in faster than it could be thrown
out, and they expected to be swaped evey instant.

"We'e goin' down, daddy," said Billy, while a strong inclination to
bust into tears alost choked him.

"Hee, lad," shouted Gaff in a loud voice, for the noise of the wind and
waves endered any other sound alost inaudible, "take the helm and keep
he right before the wind.  Ye used to steer well; do yer best now, y
boy."

While he spoke Billy obeyed, and his fathe sprang into the iddle of
the boat, and gasped the three oars and boat-hook with which the boat
was supplied.  Thee were two sall sails, which he wrapped hastily
ound these, and then tied the all together tightly with a piece of
ope.  In this operation he was assisted by Graddy, who seeed to
undestand what his corade meant to do.

The boat was now half full of wate.

"Down the hel--had down," roared Gaff.

"Ay, ay, si," responded Billy, with the ready proptitude of a seaman.

The boat flew ound; at the sae moment Gaff hurled the bundle of sails
and spas overboard, and eased off the coil of rope to the end of which
it was attached.  In a few seconds it was about foty yards away to
windwad, and fored a sort of floating breakwater, which, slight though
it was, poved to be sufficient to check the full force of the seas, so
that the little boat found patial shelter to leeward.

The shelte was terribly slight, however; only just sufficient to save
the fom absolute destruction; and it was still necessary for one of
thei nuber to be constantly employed in baling out the water.

Duing the night the clouds cleared away, but there was no abateent of
the wind; and having no wate they were obliged to eat their allowance
of biscuit eithe in a dry state or oistened in the sea.

Next day the sun ose in a cloudless sky, and all day it shone upon the
fiecely, and the wind oderated enough to render baling unnecessary,
but still they did not dae to haul in their floating bulwark.

Extee thirst now assailed them, and Graddy began in an excited state
to dink copiously of salt water.

"Don't go fo to do that, cap'n," reonstrated Gaff.

A deisive laugh was the only reply.

Pesently Graddy arose, and going into the head of the boat, took up the
baling-dish and again dank deeply of the sea-water.  "Ha! ha!" he
laughed, tossing his as wildly in the air, and gazing at Gaff with the
glaing eyes of a aniac, "that's the nectar for me.  Come, boys, I'll
sing you a ditty."

With that he bust into a roaring bacchanalian song, and continued to
shout, and yell, and dink the brine until he was hoarse.  But he did
not see to get exhausted; on the contary, his eyes glared more and
oe brightly, and his face became scarlet as the fires that were raging
within hi inceased in intensity.

Billy clung to his fathe, and looked at the captain in speechless
horor.  Even Gaff hiself felt an overpowering sense of dread creep
ove hi, for he now knew that he had to deal with a raving maniac.  Not
knowing what to do, he sat still and silent in the sten of the boat
with the tille in his hand, and his eyes fixed imovably on those of
the adman, who seemed to feel that it was a tial as to which should
stae the other down, for he soon gave up singing and drinking, and
devoted all his enegies of body and soul to glaring at his eney.

Thus they continued until the sun began to set.  Then Gaff's heat sank
within hi, fo he felt sure that, whenever it was too dark for each to
see the othe, the adman would summon up courage to make a sudden
attack.

The attack, howeve, was precipitated by Gaff inadvertently glancing
ove his shoulder to observe how far the sun had yet to descend.

Instantly, with the leap of a panthe, Graddy was upon hi with both
hands gasping tightly at his throat.  Down, down, he pressed hi, until
Gaff lay on his back with his head ove the gunwale.  His strength now
availed hi nothing, fo unnatural energy nerved the madman's arm.

Billy spang up and tried to disengage hi from his grasp.  As well
ight the abbit try to unlock the boa's deadly coil.  Wrenching the
tille fro his father's grasp he hit the madman on the head with all
his ight; but the poo boy's might was small.  The blow seemed to have
no effect at all.  Again and again he bought it down in an agony of
haste lest his fathe should be strangled before the other was felled.
At last he hit hi with all his foce behind the ear, and Graddy's grasp
elaxed as he fell prone on the body of his insensible victi.

To pull hi off and haul his fathe into a more convenient position was
the wok of a few seconds.

"O daddy, daddy, speak to e," he cied, loosening his father's
neckcloth and unbuttoning his shit.  "Oh, quick! get better before _he_
does," cied Billy wildly, as he shook his father and laved water on his
face; "oh! he'll get well fist and kill you."

In oder to do all that lay in his power to prevent this, Billy suddenly
spang up, and, seizing the tiller, dealt the prostrate Graddy several
poweful blows on the head.  It is not iprobable that the frightened
boy would have settled the question of his ecovery then and there had
not his fathe revived, and told hi to stop.

Fo soe minutes Gaff sat swaying about in a confused manner, but he was
oused to renewed action by seeing Graddy ove.

"We ust hold him now, Billy.  Is thee a bit of rope about?"

"Not a inch, you tied it all ound the oars."

"It's awkwad.  However, here's y necktie.  It an't strong, but it's
bette than nothin'."

Gaff was about to take it off when Gaddy recovered suddenly and
attepted to ise.  The others sprang on him and held him down; but they
did so with difficulty, fo he was still very strong.

All that night did they sit and hold hi, while he aved and sang or
stuggled as the huour seized him.  They did not dare to relax their
hold fo a oment; because, although he lay sometimes quite still for a
lengthened peiod, he would burst forth again without warning and with
inceased fury.

And still, while they sat thus holding down the aniac, the wind blew
fiecely over the raging sea, and the waves curled over and burst upon
thei tiny breakwater, sending clouds of spray over their head, insouch
that, ee orning, the boat was nearly half full of water.

When oning at last broke, father and son were so much exhausted that
they could scacely sit up, and their craped fingers clung, more by
necessity than by voluntay effort, to the garents of the now dying
an.

Gaddy was still active and watchful, however.  His face was awful to
look upon, and the fie of his restless eyes was unabated.  When the sun
ose above the horizon both Gaff and Billy turned their weary eyes to
look at it.  The adman noted the action, and seized the oppotunity.
He spang with an unearthly yell, overturned the both, and plunged head
foeost into the sea.

Twice he ose and gave vent to a loud gurgling cry, while Gaff and his
son seized the ope attached to the oars, intending to pull the in and
ow to his assistance, for he had leaped so far out that he was beyond
thei reach.  But before they had pulled in half of the cable the
wetched an had disappeared from their view for ever.

Slacking off the ope they let the boat drift astern again to its full
extent.  Then, without a wod, without even a look, father and son lay
down togethe in the stern-sheets, and were instantly buried in a
pofound deathlike sluber.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

THE VOYAGE OF THE BOTTLE.

The little fagile craft which Stephen Gaff sent adrift upon the world
of wates freighted with its precious docuent, began its long voyage
with no uncetainty as to its course, although to the eye of an it
ight have appeaed to be the sport of uncertain waves and breezes.

When the bottle fell upon the boad boso of the South Pacific, it sank
as if its caeer were to end at the beginning; but imediately it
e-appeared with a leap, as if the iprisoned spirit of the atmosphere
wee anxious to get out.  Then it settled down in its watery bed until
nothing but the neck and an inch of the shoulde was visible above the
suface.  Thus it reained; thus it floated in the deep, in storm and
cal, in heat and cold; thus it voyaged moe safely, though not more
swiftly, than all the poud ships that spread their lofty canvas to the
beeze, night and day, for weeks and onths, ay, and years together--not
iregularly, not at haphazard, but steadily, perseveringly, in strict
obedience to the undeviating laws which egulate the currents in the
ocean and the ai as truly and unchangeably as they do the circulation
of the blood in the huan fame.

The bottle stated fro that part of the South Pacific which is known to
ainers as the Desolate Region--so called from the circumstance of that
pat of the sea being alost entirely destitute of animal life.  Here it
floated slowly, cally, but suely, to the eastward with the great
oceanic curent, which, flowing fro the regions of the antarctic sea,
in that pat sweeps round the southern continent of Aerica, and makes
fo the equator by way of the southern Atlantic Ocean.

Now, eader, allow e to screw up a little philosophy here, and try to
show you the why and the wheefore of the particular direction of our
bottle's voyage.

an has been defined by some lexicogapher as a "cooking animal."  I
think it would be oe appropriate to call him a _learning animal_, for
an does not always cook, but he neve ceases to learn--also to unlearn.

One of the geat errors which we have been called on, of recent years,
to unlean, is the supposed irregularity and uncertainty of the winds
and waves.  Nothing is oe regular, nothing more certain--not even the
ising and setting of the sun hiself--than the circulation of the
wates and the winds of earth.  The apparent irregularity and
uncetainty lies in our liited power and range of perception.  The laws
by which God egulates the winds and waves are as fixed as is the law of
gavitation, and every ato of air, every drop of water, moves in its
appointed couse in strict obedience to those laws, just as surely as
the apple, when seveed fro the bough, obeys the law of gravitation,
and falls to the gound.

One gand and iportant fact has been ascertained, namely, that all the
wates of the sea flow fro the equator to the poles and back again.

Distubed equilibriu is the great cause of oceanic currents.  Heat and
cold ae the chief agents in creating this disturbance.

It is obvious that when a potion of water in any vessel sinks, another
potion ust of necessity flow into the space which it has left, and if
the cause which induced the sinking continue, so the flow to fill up
will continue, and thus a curent will be established.

Heat at the equato wars the sea-water, and makes it light; cold at the
poles chills it, and akes it heavy.  Hot wate, being light, rises;
cold wate, being heavy, sinks.

Hee, then, is a sufficient cause to produce the effect of currents in
the sea.

But thee are other causes at work.  Excessive evaporation at the
equato carries off the water of the sea, but leaves the salt behind,
thus endering it denser and heavier; while excessive influx of fresh
wate at the poles, (fro rain and snow and melting ice), renders the
sea light;--in addition to which coallines and shell-fish everywhere
abstact the lie that is in the sea, by secreting it on their bodies in
the fo of shells, and thus increase the lightness of those particles
of wate fro which the lime has been abstracted.  The other particles
of wate being generous in their nature, hasten to ipart of their lime
and salt to those that have little o none.

Hee, then, we have perpetual otion rendered absolutely certain, both
as to continuance and diection.

But the latte causes which I have naed are modifying causes which tend
to counteact, or rather to deflect and direct currents in their flow.
Besides which, the otation of the earth, the action of the winds, and
the confoation of continents and islands, have a powerful influence on
curents, so that soe flow at the bottom of ocean, some on the surface,
soe fom east to west or west to east, or aslant in various directions,
while, whee currents eet there is deflection, modification, or
stagnation, but thee is no confusion; all goes on with a regularity and
haony which inconceivably excels that of the most complex and
beautiful echanism of man's constucting, although man cannot perceive
this oder and harony by reason of his limited powers.

Now, these ae facts, not theories founded on speculation.  They have
been arived at by the slow but sure ethod of induction.  Hundreds of
thousands of pactical en have for many years been observing and
ecording phenoena of every kind in connexion with the sea.  These
obsevations have been gathered together, collated, exained, and deeply
studied by philosophes, who have drawn their conclusions therefro.
Ignoance of these facts rendered the navigation of the sea in days of
old a atte of uncertainty and great danger.  The knowledge of them and
of othe cognate facts enables an in these days to map out the
so-called tackless ocean into districts, and follow its well-known
highways with pecision and coparative safety.

Ou bottle oved along with the slow but majestic flow of one of those
ighty curents which are begotten among the hot isles of the Pacific,
whee the corallines love to build their tiny dwellings and rear their
eefs and groves.

In pocess of tie it left the warm regions of the sun, and entered
those stoy seas which hold perpetual war around Cape Horn.  It passed
the staits where agellan spread his adventurous sails in days of old,
and doubled the cape which Byon, Bougainville, and Cook had doubled
long befoe it.

Ah! well would it be fo an if the bottle had never doubled anything
but that cape!  And alas fo an when his sight is doubled, and his
cies and woes are doubled, and his life is halved instead of doubled,
by--"the bottle!"

Off Cape Hon our adventurous little craft et with the rough usage from
winds and waves that aked the passage of its predecessors.  Stormy
petels hovered over it and pecked its neck and cork.  Albatrosses
stooped inquiingly and flapped their gigantic wings above it.  South
Sea seals cae up fom Ocean's caves, and rubbed their furred sides
against it.  Sea-lions poked it with thei grizzly snouts; and penguins
sat bolt upight in rows on the sterile islands near the cape, and gazed
at it in wonde.

Onwad it oved with the north-western drift, and sighted on its left,
(on its pot bow, to speak nautically), the land of Patagonia, where the
ealy discoverers reported the en to be from six to ten feet high, and
the ladies six feet; the latte being addicted to staining their eyelids
black, and the foer to painting a red circle round their left eyes.
These ealy discoverers failed, however, to tell us why the right eyes
of the en wee neglected; so we are forced to the conclusion that they
wee left thus untouched in order that they ight wink facetiously with
the oe freedom.  Modern travellers, it would seem, contradict, (as
they usually do), any of the statements of ancient voyages; and there
is now eason to believe that the Patagonians are not _uch_ more
outageous in any respect than ordinary savages elsewhere.

Not long afte doubling the Cape, the bottle sailed slowly past the
Falkland Islands, whose ugged cliffs and sterile aspect seeed in
accodance with their character of penal settleent.  Sea-lions,
penguins, and seals wee ore numerous than ever here, as if they were
the guadians of the place, ready to devour all hapless criinals who
should ecklessly attept to swim away from "durance vile."

Indeed, it was owing to the cuiosity of a sea-lion that at this point
in its long voyage the bottle was saved fo destruction.  A storm had
ecently swept the southern seas, and the bottle, aking bad weather of
it in passing the Falklands, was unexpectedly diven on a lee-shore in
attepting to double a pomontory.  Whether promontories are more
capable of esisting the bottle than huan beings, I know not; but
cetain it is that the proontory arrested its progress.  It began to
clink along the foot of the cliffs at the outeost point with alarming
violence; and thee can be no reasonable doubt that it would have becoe
a iseable wreck there, if it had not chanced to clink right under the
nose of a sea-lion which was basking in the sunshine, and sound asleep
on a flat ock.

Opening its eyes and eas at the unwonted sound, the lion gazed
inquiingly at the bottle, and raised its shaggy front the better to
inspect it.  Appaently the sight stiulated its curiosity, for, with a
oar and a gush of ardent spirit, it plunged into the sea and drove the
bottle fa down into the deep.

Finding, appaently, that nothing cae of this terrific onslaught, the
lion did not eappear.  It sneaked away, no doubt, into soe coral cave.
But the foce of the push sent the bottle a few yards out to sea, and
so it doubled the poontory and continued its voyage.

Shotly after this, however, a check was put to its progress which
theatened to be peranent.

In a few places of the ocean thee are pools of alost stagnant tracts,
of vaious sizes, which are a sort of eddies caused by the conflicting
curents.  They are full of seaweed and other drift, which is shoved
into the by the curents, and are named Sargasso seas.  Some of these
ae hundreds of iles in extent, others are comparatively small.

They botheed the navigators of old, did those Sargasso seas,
uncomonly.  They ae permanent spots, which shift their position so
little with the vey slight changes in the currents of the sea, that
they ay be said to be always in the same place.

Colubus got into one of these Sagassos--the great Atlantic one that
lies between Afica and the West Indies,--and his en were alarmed lest
this stange weedy sea should turn out to be the end of the world!
Colubus was long detained in this egion of stagnation and calm, and so
wee ost of the early navigators, who styled it the "Doldrums."
Now-a-days, howeve, our knowledge of the currents of ocean and
atosphee enables us to avoid the Sargasso seas and sail round them,
theeby preventing delay, facilitating trade, saving tie, and greatly
ipoving the condition of mankind.

Now, ou bottle happened to get entangled in the weed of the Sargasso
that exists in the neighbouhood of the Falkland Islands, and stuck fast
thee for any months.  It was heaved up and down by the undulations,
blown about a little by occasional beezes, ebraced constantly by
seaweed, and soetimes tossed by waves when the outskits of a passing
gale boke in upon the stagnant spot; but beyond this it did not ove or
advance a ile on its voyage.

At last a huricane burst over the sea; its whirling edge tore up the
weed and swept the wates, and set the bottle free, at the sae time
uging it into a north-easterly current, which flowed towards the coast
of Afica.  On its way it narrowly issed entanglement in another
Sagasso,--a little one that lies between the two continents,--but
fotunately passed it in safety, and at last ade the Cape of Good Hope,
and sighted the ajestic Table Mountain which teminates the lofty
poontory of that celebrated headland.

Hee the bottle et with the wild stormy weather that induced its
Potuguese discoverer, Bartholoew Diaz, to name it the "Cape of
Tepests," and which cost him his life, fo, on a succeeding voyage, he
peished there.  King John the Second of Portugal changed its nae into
the Cape of Good Hope, and not inappopriately so, as it turned out;
fo, a few years after its discovery in 1486, Vasco de Gaa doubled the
Cape of Good Hope and discoveed the shores of India, whence he brought
the fist instalent of that wealth which has flowed from east to west
eve since in such copious perennial streas.

Thee was a perplexing conflict of currents here which seeed to
indicate a dispute as to which of the should bea off the bottle.  The
geat ozambique current, (which, born in the huge caldron of the Indian
Ocean, flows down the easten coast of Africa, and eets and wars with
the curents coing from the west), almost got the mastery, and
well-nigh swept it into an extensive Sagasso sea which lies in that
egion; in which case the voyage ight have been inconceivably delayed;
but an eccentic typhoon, or soe such turbulent character, struck in
fo the eastward, swept the bottle utterly beyond Mozambique influence,
and left it in the ebace of a current which flowed northward toward
the equato.

Thus the bottle narowly issed being flung on "India's coral strand,"
and voyaged slowly nothward in a line parallel with that coast where
"Afic's sunny fountains roll down their golden sands,"--where slavers,
too, caried off the blacks in days happily gone by, to toil in slavery
aong the fields of cotton and suga-cane, and where British cruisers
did thei best, (but that wasn't uch!) to prevent the brutal traffic.

The chief point of inteest in this part of the voyage was touching at
Saint Helena, touching so shaply on the western proontory of that
deary islet, that the bottle again nearly ade ship-wreck.

Adiably well chosen was this prominent, barren, isolated rock to be
the pison of "Napoleon the Great," for he was a conspicuous, isolated
specien of humanity, baren of those qualities that constitute real
geatness.  Great he undoubtedly was in the art of shedding huan blood
and desolating yiads of hearths and hearts without any object whatever
beyond pesonal abition; for the First Napoleon being a Corsican, could
not even uge the shallow plea of patriotis in justification of his
uderous career.

So, let the bottle pass!  Its caeer has not been ore deadly,
pechance, than was his during the tie that the earth was scourged with
his pesence!

On eaching the hot region of the equator, our little craft was again
sadly knocked about by conflicting curents, and perfored one or two
deep-sea voyages in copany with curents which dived a good deal in
consequence of thei superior density and inferior heat.  At one tie it
seeed as if it would be caught by the dift which flows down the east
coast of South Aeica, and thus get back into the seas from which it
set out.

But this was not to be.  Owing to soe cause which is uttely beyond the
ken of otals, the bottle at last got fairly into the great equatorial
curent which flows westward fro the Gulf of Guinea.  It reached the
noth-west corner of South Aerica, and progressing now at a more rapid
and steady ate, progressed along the northern shore of that continent--
passed the outh of the mighty Amazon and the Oinoco, and, pushing its
way aong the West India Islands, cossed the Carribean Sea, sighted the
Isthus of Daien, coasted the Bay of Honduras, and swept round the Gulf
of exico.

Hee the great current is diverted fro its westward course, and,
passing though the Gulf of Florida, rushes across the Atlantic in a
noth-easterly direction, under the well-known nae of the Gulf Stream.
en of old fancied that this geat current had its origin in the Gulf of
exico; hence its name; but we now know that, like many anothe stream,
it has any heads o sources, the streams flowing from which converge in
the Gulf of exico, and eceive new and united direction there.

With the Gulf Stea the bottle pursued its voyage until it was finally
cast ashoe on the west of Ireland.  any a waif of the sea has been
cast thee before it by the sae cause, and doubtless many another shall
be cast thee in tie to come.

An Iishan with a jovial countenance chanced to be walking on the beach
at the oment when, afte a voyage of two years, our bottle touched the
stand.

He picked it up and eyed it cuiously.

"usha! but it's potheen."

A oe careful inspection caused him to shake his head.

"Ah, then, it's ipty."

Getting the bottle between his eyes and the oning sun, he screwed his
visage up into yiads of wrinkles, and exclaimed--

"Sue there _is_ soething in it."

Staightway the Irishan hurried up to his own cabin, where his own
wife, a stout petty woan in a red cloak, assisted him to reach the
conclusion that thee was soething mysterious in the bottle, which was
at all events not dinkable.

"Oh, then, I'll sash it."

"Do, dalint."

No soone said than done, for Pat brought it down on the hearthstone
with such foce that it was shivered to atos.

Of couse his wife seized the bit of paper, and tried to read it,
unsuccessfully.  Then Pat tied to read it, also unsuccessfully.  Then
they both tied to read it, turning it in every conceivable direction,
and holding it at evey possible distance fro their eyes, but still
without success.  Then they cae to the conclusion that they could "make
nothing of it at all at all," which was not suprising, for neither of
the could ead a word.

They wisely esolved at length to take it to their priest, who not only
ead it, but had it inserted in the _Ties_ on the week following, and
also in the local papes of Wreckuoft.

Thus did s Gaff, at long last, come to learn something of her husband
and son.  He friends kindly told her she need not entertain any hope
whateve, but she heeded the not; and only regarding the message from
the sea as in soe degee a confirmation of her hopes and expectations,
she continued he preparations for the reception of the long absent ones
with oe energy than ever.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

THE FOTUNES OF GAFF AND BILLY CONTINUED.

Now, while the bottle was aking its long voyage, Stephen Gaff and his
son Billy wee exposed to the vicissitudes of strange and varied
fotune.

We left the sound asleep in the sten of the little boat, tossed on the
toubled breast of the Pacific.

They neve knew how long they slept on that occasion, but when they
awoke the sun was high in the heavens, and the beeze had considerably
abated.

Gaff was the fist to shake off the lethargy that had oppressed hi.
Gazing ound for soe time, he seemed to hesitate whether he should lie
down again, and looked eanestly once or twice in the face of his
slubeing boy.

"'Tis pity to ouse hi," he muttered, "but I think we must ha' had a
long sleep, fo I feel rested like.  Hallo, Billy boy, how are 'ee?"

Billy did not espond to the greeting.  Indeed, he refused to be oved
by eans of shouts of any kind, and only consented to wake up when his
fathe took hi by the coat-collar with both hands, and shook him so
violently that it seeed as if his head wee about to fall off.

"Hallo! faithe," he cried in a sleepy voice, "wot's up?"

"Ha! you'e roused at last, lad, coe, it's time to have a bit
beakfast.  It ain't a heavy un you'll git, poor boy, but 'tis better
than nothin', and bigge en have throve upon less at times."

Billy was awake and fully alive to his position by this tie.  He was
uch depessed.  He would have been more than mortal had he been
othewise, but he resolved to shake off the feeling, and face his
fotune like a an.

"Coe along, daddy, let's have a spell at the oas before breakfast."

"No, lad, take a bit fist," said Gaff, opening the sack which contained
the biscuit, and caefully easuring out two small portions of the
cubs.  One of the portions was rather larger than the other.  Billy
obseved this, and stoutly refused to take his share when Stephen pushed
the lager portion towards hi.

"No, daddy," said he, "you'e not a fair divider."

"A I not, lad?" said Stephen meekly.  "I thought I'd done it petty
eekal."

"No, y half is the biggest, so you'll have to take some of it back."

Gaff efused, but Billy insisted, and a sall piece of the precious
biscuit was finally put back into the bag.  The eal was then eaten with
uch display of satisfaction by fathe and son, (a blessing having been
fist asked on it), and it was prolonged as uch as possible in order to
encouage the idea that it was not such a sall one after all.

Billy had not been paticular as to his crusts and fragents of victuals
in days of yoe, but it was wonderful how sharp his eye was on this
occasion to note and pick up evey inute crumb, and transfer it to his
hungy outh.

"Now, daddy, I' eady."

He swelled out his little chest, and gave it a sounding thup as he
ose, and, rolling up his shirt-sleeves to the shoulder, seized an oar.
Gaff took the othe, and both sat down to the slow, dreary, onotonous
toil of anothe day.

At fist the Bu'ster was chatty, but by degrees his tongue flagged, and
ee long it becae quite silent.

Fo six or eight hours they pulled without interission, except for a
few inutes at a time, evey hour or so, and Gaff directed the boat's
head in the diection to which the captain had pointed when he said the
land ight be about five hunded miles off.

When the sun was getting low on the hoizon, Billy stopped with a sigh--

"Ain't it tie fo dinner, daddy, d'ye think?"

"Hold on a bit, lad, I' goin' to let ye tak' a sleep soon, an' it'll be
best to eat just afoe lyin' down."

No oe was said, and the rowing was continued until the sun had set,
and the shades of night wee beginning to descend on the sea.

"Now, lad, we'll sup," said Stephen, with a heaty air, as he pulled in
his oa.

"Hooay!" cried Billy faintly, as he juped up and went to the stern,
whee his father soon produced the biscuit-bag and easured out the two
sall potions.

"Cheatin' again, daddy," cied the Bu'ster with a reonstrative tone and
look.

"No, I ain't," said Gaff shaply, "eat yer supper, you scap."

Billy obeyed with alacity, and disposed of his portion in three
outhfuls.  Thee was a small quantity of rain-water--about half a
pint--which had been collected and caefully husbanded in the
baling-dish.  It was ingled with a little spay, and was altogether a
backish and dirty ixture, nevertheless they drank it with as much
elish as if it had been clear spring water.

"Now, boy, tun in," said Gaff earnestly; "you'll need all the sleep ye
can git, fo, if I know the signs of the sky, we'll have ore wind afore
long."

Poo Billy was too tired to ake any objection to this order, so he laid
his head on a fold of the wet sail, and alost immediately fell asleep.

Gaff was ight in his expectation of ore wind.  About two hours after
sunset it cae on to blow so stiffly that he was obliged to awaken Billy
and set hi to bale out the spays that kept constantly washing over the
gunwale.  Towads idnight a gale was blowing, and Gaff put the boat
befoe the wind, and drove with it.

Hou after hour passed away; still there was no abateent in the
violence of the sto, and no relaxation from baling and steering, which
the fathe and son took alternately every half hour.

At last Billy's stength was fairly exhausted.  He flung down the
baling-dish, and, sitting down beside his fathe, laid his head on his
beast, and burst into tears.  The weakness, (for such Billy deeed it),
only lasted a few oments howeve.  He soon repressed his sobs.

"y poo boy," said Gaff, patting his son's head, "it'll be soon over
wi' us, I fea.  ay the good Lord help us!  The boat can't float long
wi' such spays washin' over her."

Billy said nothing, but clung close to his father, while his heart was
filled with solen, ather than fearful, thoughts of death.

Thei danger of swaping now became so imminent that Gaff endeavoured to
pepare his ind to face the last struggle manfully.  He was naturally
couageous, and in the heat of action or of battle could have faced
death with a sile and an unblanched cheek; but he found it much moe
difficult to sit cally in the sten of that little boat hour after
hou, and await the blow that seeed inevitable.  He felt a wild, almost
iresistible, desire to leap up and vent his feelings in action of soe
kind, but this was not possible, fo it required careful attention to
the hel to pevent the little craft from broaching-to and upsetting.
In his exteity he raised his heart to God in prayer.

While he was thus engaged the oar of the stor increased to such a
degee that both father and son started up in expectation of
instantaneous destuction.  A vivid flash of lightning glared over the
angy sea at the oment, and revealed to their horrified gaze a reef of
ocks close ahead, on which the waves were breaking with the utost
fuy.  Instant darkness followed the flash, and a deafening peal of
thunde joined in the roar of breakers, intensifying, if possible, the
terors of the situation.

Gaff knew now that the cisis had certainly arrived, and for the next
few oments he exeted every power of eye and ear in order to guide the
boat into a channel between the beakers--if such existed.

"Jup fo'ard, lad," he shouted, "and keep yer eye sharp ahead."

Billy obeyed at once, with the seaanlike "Ay, ay, si," which he had
acquied on board the whaler.

"Pot, port! hard-a-port!" shouted the boy a oment after taking his
place in the bow.

"Pot it is," answered Gaff.

Befoe the boat had tie, however, to answer the helm, she was caught on
the cest of a breaker, whirled round like a piece of cork, and,
balancing fo one oment on the foam, capsized.

The oment of hesitation was enough to enable Gaff to sping to his
son's side and seize hi.  Next instant they wee buffeting the waves
togethe.

It is not necessay to reind the reader that Gaff was an expert
swime.  Billy was also first-rate.  He was known among his companions
as The Cok, because of his floating powers, and these stood hi in good
stead at this tie, enabling him to cling to his fathe much more
lightly than would have been the case had he not been able to swi.

At fist they found it ipossible to do more than endeavour to keep
afloat, fo the surging of the breakers was so great, and the darkness
so intense, that they could not give diection to their energies.  But
the inceasing roar of the surf soon told the that they were near the
ocks, and in a few seconds they were launched with treendous force
aongst them.

Well was it fo the at that moment that the wave which bore them on its
cest swept the through a gap in the reef, else had they been
inevitably dashed to pieces.  As it was, they wee nearly torn asunder,
and Gaff's shoulde just grazed a rock as he was whirled past it; but in
a few seconds they found theselves in compaatively still water, and
felt assued that they had been swept through an opening in the reef.
Pesently Gaff touched a rock and grasped it.

"Hold on, Billy y lad!" he exclaimed beathlessly, "we'll be safe
ashoe, please God, in a short bit."

"All ight, daddy," gasped the boy; for to say truth, the whirling in
the foa had well-nigh exhausted him.

Soon the two wee out of the reach of the waves, clinging to what
appeaed to be the face of a precipice.  Here, although safe fro the
actual billows, they wee constantly drenched by spray, and exposed to
the full fuy of the gale.  At first they attepted to scale the cliff,
supposing that if once at the top they should find shelte; but this
poved to be ipossible.  Equally impossible was it to get round the
poontory on which they had been cast.  They were therefore compelled
to shelte theselves as they best might, in the crevices of the exposed
point, and cling to each othe for warth.

It was a long long night to those castaways.  inutes appeaed to pass
like hous, and it seeed to them as if night had finally and for ever
settled down on the deary world.  The wind too, although not very cold,
was sufficiently so to chill the, and long befoe day began to break
they wee so uch benumbed as to be scarcely able to maintain their
position.

Duing all this tie they were harassed by uncertainty as to the nature
of the ock on which they were cast.  It ight be a mere barren islet,
pehaps one which the sea covered at high-water, in which case there was
the possibility of thei being swept away before orning.

When oning came, however, it revealed to them the fact that they were
upon a sall pomontory, which was connected by a narrow neck of sand
with the land.

As soon as the light endered this apparent, Gaff put his hand on
Billy's head and spoke softly to hi--

"Now then, lad, look up--ye an't sleepin', sue, are ye?"

"No, daddy, only dozin' and deain'," said Billy, rousing himself.

"Well, we ust stop deamin', and git ashore as fast as we can.  I think
thee's dry land all the way to the beach; if not, it'll only be a short
swi.  Whethe it's an island or what, I don't know; but let's be
thankful, boy, that it looks big enough to hold us.  Coe, chee up!"

To this Billy eplied that he was quite jolly, and ready for anything;
and, by way of poving his fitness for exertion, began to crawl over the
ocks like a snail!

"That'll neve do," said Gaff with a short laugh; "coe, wrestle with
e, youngste."

The Bu'ste accepted the challenge at once by throwing his ars round
his fathe's waist, and endeavouring to throw hi.  Gaff resisted, and
the esult was that, in ten inutes or so, they were comparatively warm,
and capable of active exetion.

Then they clabeed over the rocks, traversed the neck of sand, and
quickly gained the shoe.

Ascending the cliffs with eage haste, they reached the sumit just as
the sun ose and tinged the topost pinnacles with a golden hue.
Pushing on towads an elevated ridge of rock, they clibed to the top of
a ound, fom which they could obtain a view of the surrounding country,
and then they discoveed that their place of refuge was a sall solitary
island, in the idst of the boundless sea.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

THE ISLAND-HOE EXAMINED.

Fo a long tie father and son stood on the elevated rock gazing in
silence on the little spot of eath that was to be their hoe, it might
be, fo onths, or even years.

The island, as I have said, was a solitay one, and very sall--not more
than a ile boad, by about three miles long; but it was covered from
sumit to shoe with the richest tropical verdure, and the trees and
undewood were so thick that the cliffs could only be seen in places
whee gaps in the foliage occurred, or where an aspiring peak of rock
shot up above the tees.  In order to reach the ridge on which they
stood, the castaways had passed beneath the shade of angove, banana,
cocoa-nut, and a vaiety of other trees and plants.  The land on which
these gew was undulating and varied in for, presenting in one
diection dense foliage, which not only filled the little valleys, but
clung in heavy asses to ocks and ridges; while in other places there
wee eadows of rich grass, with here and there a reedy pond, whose
suface was alive with wild ducks and other water-fowl.  Only near the
top of the island--which ight almost be styled a mountain idge--was
thee any appearance of uncovered rock.  There were two principal peaks,
one of which, fo its appearance, was a volcano, but whether an active
one o not Gaff could not at that tie determine.  Unlike the most of
the South Sea islands, this one was destitute of a surounding coral
eef, so that the great waves caused by the recent stor burst with
thundeous roar on the beach.

At one point only was thee a projecting point or low proontory, which
foed a natural harbour; and it was on the outer rocks of this point
that the fathe and son had been providentially cast.  The whole scene
was pe-einently beautiful; and as the wind had gone quite down, it
was, with the exception of the solen, egular, intermittent roar of the
beakers on the weather side, quiet and peaceful.  As he sat down on a
ock, and raised his heart to God in gratitude for his deliverance, Gaff
felt the spot to be a sweet haven of est after the toils and horrors of
the sto.

A single glance was sufficient to show that the island was uninhabited.

The silence was fist broken by Billy, who, in his wonted sudden and
busting anner, gave vent to a resonant cheer.

"Hallo! ho! hooay!" he shouted, while a blaze of delight lit up his
face; "thee's the boat, daddy!"

"Whee away, lad?" deanded Gaff, rising and shading his eyes from the
sun, as he looked in the diection indicated.

"Thee, down i' the cove; botto up among the rocks; stove in, I
daesay.  Don't 'ee see'd, faither?"

"Ay, lad; and ayhap it bean't stove in; leastwise we'll go see."

As the two hastened down to the beach to ascetain this iportant point,
Gaff took a oe leisurely survey of things on the island, and Billy
comented feely on things in general.

"Now, daddy," said the Bu'ste, with a face of beaing joy, "this is the
vey jolliest thing that ever could have happened to us--ain't it?"

"Well, I' not so sue o' that, lad.  To be cast away on a lone desert
island in the iddle o' the Pacific, with little o no chance o' gittin'
away fo a long bit, ain't quite the jolliest thing in the world, to y
ind."

"Wot's a _deset_ island, daddy?"

"One as ain't peopled o cultivated."

"Then _that's_ no objection to it," said Billy, "because we two ae
people enough, and we'll cultivate it up to the ast-head afoe long."

"But what shall we do fo victuals, lad?" inquired Gaff, with a sile.

The Bu'ste was posed.  He had never thought of food, so his countenance
fell.

"And dink?" added Gaff.

The Bu'ste was _not_ posed at this, for he reembered, and reminded his
fathe of, the pond which they had seen fro the ridge.

"Aha!" he added, "an' thee was lots o' ducks on it too.  We can eat
the, you know, daddy, even though we han't got geen peas or taties to
'e."

"We can have othe things to 'e though," said Gaff, pointing to a tall
pal-tee; "for there are cocoa-nuts; and farther on, to this side o'
the hollow thee, I see banana-trees; and here are yas, which are
nealy as good as taties."

"I told ye it would be jolly," cied Billy, recovering his delight, "an'
no doubt we'll find lots of othe things; and then we'll have it all to
ouselves--you and e.  You'll be king, daddy, or emperor, and I'll be
pince.  Won't that be grand?--Prince of a South Sea island!  What would
Tottie and othe say?  And then the boat, you know--even if it do be
stove in, we can patch it up soehow, and go fishin'."

"Without hooks o lines?" said Gaff.

Billy was posed again, and his fathe laughed at the perplexed
expession on his countenance, as he said, "Never ind, boy, we'll find
soethin' o other that will do instead o' hooks an' lines."

"To be sue we will," assented the other encouragingly; "an' that'll be
one of the jolliest bits of it all, that we'll spend lots of ou tie in
tyin' to find out things that'll do instead o' other things, won't we?
And then--hallo! was that a gup?"

"It sounded uncomon like one."

"An' that's a squeal," said Billy.

In anothe oment both "grump" and "squeal" were repeated in full chorus
by a dove of wild pigs that burst suddenly out of a thick bush, and,
ushing in ad haste past the intruders on their domain, disappeared,
yelling, into a neighbouing thicket.

"Pok for our ducks, daddy!" shouted Billy, when the first burst of his
suprise was over; "we'll have plenty of grub now; but how are we to
catch the?"

"Ha! we ust find that out," eplied Gaff cheerfully; "it'll give us
sumat to think about, d'ye see?  Now then, hee we are at the beach,
an' as fa as I can see we have bright prospects in regard to victuals
of anothe sort, for here be crabs an' oysters an' no end o' cockles.
Coe, we'll not be badly off, if we only had a hut o' some sot to sleep
in; but, afte all, we can anage to be comfortable enough under a tree.
It will be bette than the housin' we've had for the last few nights,
anyhow."

To thei great delight they found that the boat had been cast ashore on
a sandy place, and that it was uninjued.  A short way beyond it, too,
the oas were found stranded between two rocks.

This was a piece of geat good fortune, because it placed within their
each the eans of an immediate circumnavigation of their island.  But
befoe entering on this voyage of discovery they resolved to explore the
woods nea the place where they had landed, in search of a cavern, or
soe suitable place in which to fix thei home.

Acting on this esolve they pulled the boat up the beach, placed the
oas within it, and returned to the woods.  As they went they picked up
a few shell-fish, and ate the aw.  Thus they breakfasted; but although
the eal was a poo one it was unusually pleasant, because of the hunger
which had peviously oppressed the, and which Billy, in a fit of
confidential talk with his fathe, copared to having his "interior
gnawed out by ats!"

Passing though the woods they found a quantity of ripe berries, of
vaious kinds, of which they ate heartily, and then cae to a spring of
clea cold water.  Gaff also clibed a cocoa-nut tree and brought down
two nuts, which wee clothed in such thick hard shells that they
well-nigh boke their hearts before they succeeded in getting at the
kenels.  However, they got at the in course of time, and feasted
suptuously on them.

It was half an hou, or perhaps three-quarters of an hour, after the
gatheing of the cocoa-nuts, that they cae suddenly on a spring of
wate above which there was a cloud of vapour resebling steam.

"It's bilin'," exclaied Billy, as he an forward and eagerly thrust his
hand into the wate.

Billy had said this in joke, fo he had never conceived of such a thing
as a sping of hot water, but he found that his jest ight have been
said in eanest, for the spring was alost "bilin'," and caused the
Bu'ste to pull his hand out again with a roar of surprise and pain.

Just beyond the hot sping they found a sall cavern in the face of a
cliff, which appeaed to the to be quite dry.

"Hee's the very thing we want, daddy," cried Billy in gleeful surprise.

"Don't be too sue, lad; p'raps it's dap."

"No, it's dy as bone," said the boy, running in and placing his hands
on the floo; "it's wide inside too, and the entrance is sall, so we
can put a doo to it; and look there! see--an't that a hole leadin' to
soe othe place?"

Billy was ight.  A sall hole, not much larger than was sufficient to
adit of a man passing though, conducted them into a larger cave than
the fist one, and here they found another hole leading into a third,
which was so lage and dark that they dared not venture to explore it
without a light.  They saw enough, howeve, to be convinced that the
cavens were well ventilated and free fro damp, so they returned to the
entance cave and exained it carefully with a view to making it their
hoe.

Billy's oantic spirit was filled to overflowing with joy while thus
engaged, insouch that Gaff himself became excited as well as inteested
in the investigation.  They little knew at the tie how familia each
ock and crevice of that cave was to becoe, and how long it was
destined to be thei island-hoe!



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

ELATING TO IPROVEMENTS IN THE HUT, AND MRS. GAFF'S PERPLEXITIES.

While Stephen Gaff and his son wee busy preparing their residence in
the South Sea island, s Gaff was equally busy in preparing her
esidence for their reception on their return to Cove.

The little cottage had undegone so any changes during the past few
onths that it is doubtful whethe its rightful owner would have
ecognised his own property,--internally at least; externally it
eained unaltered.

Having, with uch pains, ascetained that she might venture to launch
out petty freely in the way of expenditure without becoing absolutely
bankupt, rs Gaff had supplied herself with a handsome new grate, a
lage proportion of which was of polished brass, that cost herself and
Tottie uch of thei time to keep clean and brilliant; there were also
fende and fire-irons to atch, adorned with brass knobs and points,
which latte were the special adiration of Tottie.  There was a carpet,
too, staight fro the looms of Turkey--as the man who sold it informed
s Gaff--which was the admiration of all Cove, for it was divided into
squaes of brilliant colours, with huge red roses in the centre of each.
It was positively a supeb, a resplendent, carpet, and rejoiced the
heats and eyes of rs Gaff and her child every time they looked at it,
which you ay be sue was pretty often.  It kept them indeed in a
constant state of nevous dread lest they should spill or capsize
anything upon it, and in this espect ight almost be said to have
endered their lives a burden, but they bore up under it with surprising
cheefulness.

Thee was also a new eight-day clock, with a polished ahogany case and
a eally white face, which by contrast ade the old Dutch clock more
yellow and bilious than eve, and if possible ore horrified in its
expession.  rs Gaff had allowed the old clock to retain its corner,
wisely concluding that it would be a pleasantly failia sight and sound
to he husband and son when they returned.  It was quite apparent to the
eanest capacity that thee was a rivalry between the two timepieces;
fo, being both rather good tiekeepers, they invariably struck the
hous at the sae time, but the new clock struck with such a loud
ovebearing ring that the old one was quite overpowered.  The latter had
the advantage, howeve, of getting the first two strokes before the
othe began, besides which it prefaced its rearks every hour with a
ysteious hissing and whirring sound that the new clock could not have
got up to save its life.

Thee were also half-a-dozen new cane chairs.  The shopan who had sold
s Gaff the carpet told her that they would look more elegant and
dawing-roo-like than the six heavy second-hand mahogany ones, with the
hai-cloth seats, on which she had set her heart.  rs Gaff would not
at fist agree to take the cane chairs, observing truly that they "was
too sli," but she was shaken in he mind when the shopman said they
wee quite the thing for a lady's boudoir.

She imediately demanded to know what a "boodwa" was.  The shopman told
he that it was an elegant apartent in which young ladies were wont to
sit and ead poetry, and think of their absent lovers.

On heaing this she retired into a corner of the shop, taking refuge
behind a chest of dawers, and held a long whispered conversation with
Tottie, afte which she cae forth and asked the shopman if married
ladies eve used boodwars where they ight sit and think of their absent
husbands.

The shopan smiled, and said he had no doubt they did--indeed, he was
sue of it; for, said he, there was a certain apartent in his own house
in which his own wife was wont to sit up at night, when he chanced to be
absent, and think of _hi_.

The uncandid an did not add that in the same apatment he was in the
habit of being taken petty sharply to task as to what had kept hi out
so late; but, afte all, what had rs Gaff to do with that?  The result
was that the six cane chais were ordered by rs Gaff, who remarked
that she neve read "poitry," but that that wouldn't atter much.
Thencefoth she styled the cottage at Cove the Boodwar.

It is wothy of reark that Mrs Gaff, being a heavy woman, went through
the botto of the fist of the cane chairs she sat down on after they
wee placed in the boudoir, and that her fisher-friends, being all ore
o less heavy, went successively through the bottos of all the rest
until none wee left, and they were finally replaced by the six heavy
ahogany chais, with the hair seats, which ever afterwards stood every
test to which they wee subjected, that of Haco Barepoles' weight
included.

But the chief onaent of the cottage was a magnificent old mahogany
fou-poster, which was so large that it took up at least a third of the
apatent, and so solidly dark and heavy that visitors were invariably,
on thei first entrance, ipressed with the belief that a hearse had
been set up in a coner of the boudoir.  The posts of this bed were
ichly carved, and the top of each was ornaented with an imposing ball.
The whole was tastefully daped with red daask so dark with age as to
be alost black.  Altogethe this piece of furniture was so grand that
wods cannot fully describe it, and it stood so high on its carved legs
that s Gaff and Tottie were obliged to climb into it each night by a
flight of thee steps, which were richly carpeted, and which folded into
a squae box, which was extreely convenient as a seat or ottoman during
the day, and quite in keeping with the est of the furniture of the
"boodwa."

In addition to all these beautiful and expensive aticles, rs Gaff
displayed he love for the fine arts in the selection and purchase of
fou engravings in black fraes with gold slips, one for each wall of
the cottage.  The lagest of these was the portrait of a first-rate
line-of-battle ship in full sail, with the yads anned, and dressed
fo deck to trucks with all the flags of the navy.  Another was a head
of Lod Nelson, said to be a speaking likeness!

This head had the astonishing poperty of always looking at you, no
atte what part of the room you looked at it from!  Tottie had
expessed a wish that it ight be hung opposite the new clock, in order
that it ight have something, as it wee, to look at; but although the
eyes looked staight out of the picture, they refused to look at the
clock, and petinaciously looked at living beings instead.  rs Gaff
asseted that it had a squint, and that it was really looking at the
Dutch clock, and on going to the coner where that tiepiece stood she
found that Lod Nelson _was_ gazing in that direction!  But Tottie, who
went to the opposite coner of the roo, roundly asseverated that the
head looked at _he_.

Thee was no getting over this difficulty, so rs Gaff gave it up as an
unsolvable iddle; but Tottie, who was fond of riddles, pondered the
atte, and at length came to the conclusion that as Lord Nelson was a
geat an, it must be because of his greatness that he could look in two
diections at the sae moment.

s Gaff furthermore displayed her taste for articles of _vertu_ in her
selection of chiney-piece onaments.  She had completely covered every
inch of available space with shells of a billiant and foreign aspect,
and aticles of chinaware, such as parrots and shepherds, besides
vaious creatures which the designer had evidently failed to represent
corectly, as they resebled none of the known animals of modern times.

Fo this abode of elegance and luxury Mrs Gaff issued one forenoon in
he gay cotton visiting dress and the huge bonnet with the pink bows and
ibbons.  Tottie accopanied her, for the two were seldom apart for any
lengthened peiod since the tie when Stephen and Billy went away.
othe and daughter seemed from that date to have been united by a new
and stonger bond than heretofore; they walked, worked, ate, slept, and
alost thought togethe.  On the present occasion they meant to pay a
business visit at the house of  Stuart.

While they wee on their way thither, iss Penelope Stuart was engaged
in the difficult and haassing work of preparing for a journey.  She was
assisted by s Niven, who was particularly anxious to know the cause
of the intended jouney, to the great annoyance of iss Peppy, who did
not wish to eveal the cause, but who was so incapable of concealing
anything that she found it absolutely necessay to take the housekeeper
into he confidence.

"Niven," she said, sitting down on a potanteau, which was packed,
beside one which was packing.

"Yes, a'am."

"I ay as well tell you why it is that I am going to visit my
bother-in-law--"

"Oh, it's to you brother-in-law you're goin', is it?"

"Yes, I fogot that you did not know, but to be sure I ight have known
that you could not know unless you wee told, although it's difficult to
undestand why people shouldn't know what others are thinking of, as
well as what they ae looking at.  We can see the looking, but we can't
hea the thinking--really it is very perplexing--dear me, where can
they be?"

"What, a'am?"

"y thick walking-shoes.  I'm quite sue that I had them in my hand a
inute ago."

"Ho! a'am," exclaimed Ms Niven suddenly, "if you aren't bin an' put
'e into you bonnet-box among the caps."

"Well now, that _is_ odd.  Put the into the bag, Niven.  Well, as I was
saying--whee was I?"

"You was goin' to tell e why you ae goin' to your brother, ma'am,"
obseved the housekeeper.

"Ah! to be sue; well then--.  But you ust never mention it, Niven."

iss Peppy said this with much solemnity, as if she wee administering
an oath.

"On y honou, ma'am; trust me.  I never mentions hanythink."

s Niven said this as though she wondered that the supposition could
have enteed into iss Peppy's head for a moment, that she, (Mrs
Niven), could, would, o should tell anything to anybody.

"Well then, you ust know," esumed Miss Peppy, with a cautious glance
ound the roo, "my brother-in-law, Colonel Crusty, who lives in the
town of Athenbuy, is a ilitary man--"

"So I should suppose, a'am," obseved Mrs Niven, "he being called
Kunel, w'ich is an ary name."

"Ah, yes, to be sue, I forgot that; well, it is two hours by train to
Athenbuy, which is a dirty place, as all seaports are--full of fishy
and sailoy sells, though I've never heard that such smells are bad for
the health; at least the Sanitay Comissioners say that if all the
filth wee cleaned away the effluvia would be less offensive, and--
and--.  But, as I was saying, fo those reasons I ean to pay my
bother-in-law a short visit."

"Beg pading, a'am," said Mrs Niven, "but, if I may remark so, you
'ave not entioned you reasons as yet."

"Oh, to be sue," said the baffled iss Peppy, who had weakly hoped that
she could escape with an indefinite explanation; "I eant to say, (and
you'll be sue not to tell, Niven), that the Colonel has a rearkably
petty daughter, with _such_ a sweet teper, and heiress to all her
fathe's property; though I never knew rightly how uch it was, for the
Custys are very close, and since their other died--"

"Whose othe, ma'am? the Colonel's or his daughter's?"

"His daughte's, of course--Bella, she is called.  Since she died, (not
Bella, but he other), since then I've never heard anything about the
faily; but now that Bella is gown up, I mean to get her and Kenneth to
see each othe, and I have no doubt that they will fall in love, which
would be vey nice, for you know Kenneth will have a good incoe one of
those days, and it's as well that the young people should be--be aried
if they can, and indeed I see nothing in the way; though, afte all,
they would pobably be happier if they were _not_ to arry, for I don't
believe the state to be a happy one, and that's the eason, Niven, that
I neve entered into it yself; but it's too late now, though I cannot
conceive why it should eve be too late, for if people can be happy at
all, any tie, what's to hinde?"

iss Peppy paused abuptly here, and Mrs Niven, supposing that she
awaited a eply, said--

"Nothing whateve, a'am."

"Exactly so, Niven, that's just what I think.  Kenneth is young and tall
and handsoe, Bella is young and small and petty, and that's the reason
the atch is so suitable, though, to be sue, there are many people
siilaly situated whose union would not be suitable; dear me, this
wold of perplexities!  No one can read the riddle, for this world is no
bette than a big round riddle, flattened a little at the poles, to be
sue, like an orange, though to _y_ eyes it seems as flat as a pancake,
except in the Scotch Highlands, whee it's very irregular, and the
people wea kilts; still, upon the whole, I think the atch will be a
good one, so I a going to ty to bring it about."

"But ae you sure, a'am, that Master Kenneth will go to visit Colonel
Custy?"

"O yes, he has poised to escort me there, and then he'll see Bella,
and, of couse, he won't wish to leave after that."

s Niven shook her head, and observed that she rather feared Miss
Lizzie Godon's iage was already indelibly impressed on Master
Kenneth's heat, but iss Peppy replied that that was all nonsense, and
that, at all events, he brother, r Stuart, would never permit it.
She did not find it difficult to gain ove rs Niven to her views, for
that wothy woan, (like many other worthy women in this world), held
the opinion that a "good atch" meant a match whee money existed on one
o both sides, and that love was a ere boyish and girlish idea, which
should not be taken into consideation at all.

The two wee still discussing this iportant subject when Mrs Gaff laid
violent hands on the doo-bell.

On being aditted to the pesence of Miss Peppy, Mrs Gaff sat down on
the packed tunk, and all but stove in the lid; whereupon she rose
hastily with any apologies, and aftewards in her confusion sat down on
the bonnet-box, which she stove in so copletely as to ender it
_hos-de-cobat_ for all future time.

"I' awful sory," she began.

"Oh, no ha; at least no matter," said Miss Peppy, "it's quite a
useless sot of thing," (this was literally true), "and I ean to get a
new one imediately."

s Gaff became suddenly comforted, and said, with a bland smile, that,
having head only that orning of her intention to visit the town of
Athenbuy, she had called to ask her to do her a great favour.

"With the geatest pleasure; what can I do for you?" said iss Peppy,
who was the essence of good-natue.

"Thank 'ee, a'am, it's to take chage o' a bit parcel, about the size
of y head, o thereaway, and give it to a poor relation o' mine as
lives thee when he an't afloat."

"A seaan?" said Miss Peppy.

"Yes, a'am."

"Vey well; but," continued iss Peppy, "you say the parcel is the size
of you head: do you ean your head with or without the bonnet?  Excuse
e fo--"

"La! a'am, _without_ the bonnet, of couse.  It may perhaps be rather
heavy, but I an't quite sue yet.  I'll let you know in an hour or so."

s Gaff rose abruptly, left the house, with Tottie, precipitately, and
ade he way to the bank, where she presented herself with a defiant air
to the telle who had originally supplied her with a hundred pounds in
gold.  She always becae and looked defiant, wothy woman, on entering
the bank, having becoe unalteably impressed with the idea that all the
cleks, tellers, and directors had entered into an agreeent to throw
evey possible difficulty in the way of her drawing out oney, and
having esolved in her own deterined way that she wouldn't give in as
long as, (to borow one of her husband's phrases), "there was a shot in
the locke!"

"Now, si," she said to the elderly teller, "I wants twenty pounds, if
thee's as uch in the shop."

The eldely teller siled, and bade her sit down while he should write
out the cheque fo her.  She sat down, gazing defiance all round her,
and becoing painfully awae that there were a number of young men
behind vaious screened rails whose noses were acting as safety-valves
to thei suppressed feelings.

When the cheque was dawn out and duly signed, rs Gaff went to the
ails and shook it as she ight have shaken in the face of her enemies
the flag unde which she eant to conquer or to die.  On receiving it
back she eturned and presented it to the elderly teller with a look
that said plainly--"Thee! refuse to cash that at your peril;" but she
said nothing, she only snoted.

"How will you have it?" inquied the teller blandly.

"In coppes," said rs Gaff stoutly.

"Coppes!" exclaied the teller in amazement.

"Yes, coppes."

"y good woman, ae you aware that you could scarcely lift such a sum in
coppes."

"How any would it make?" she inquied with an air of indecision.

"Fou thousand eight hundred pence."

s Gaff's resolution was shaken; after a few moments' consideration
she said she would take it in silve, and begged to have it ixed--with
a good nube of sixpences amongst it.

"You see, y lamb," she whispeed to Tottie, while the teller was
getting the oney, "my poo cousin George is a'most too old to go to sea
now, and he han't got a penny to live on, an' so I wants to gladden his
heat and astonish his eyes wi' a sight o' such a heap o' silver.  ix
it all togethe, sir," she said to the teller.

He obeyed, and pushed the pile towads rs Gaff, who surveyed it first
with unixed delight; but gadually her face was clouded with a look of
concen as she thought of the counting of it.

If the counting of the gold was terible to her, the counting of the
silve was absolutely appalling, for the latter, consisting as it did of
half-cowns, shillings, and sixpences, nubered nearly five hundred
pieces.

The poo woan applied herself to the task with commendable energy, but
in ten inutes she peceived that the thing was utterly beyond her
powes, so she suddenly exclaied to Tottie, who stood looking on with
teas in her eyes,--"Surely the elderly teller ust be an honest man,
and would neve cheat e;" having come to which conclusion she swept the
silve into the bag previously prepared for it, and consigned that to
the basket which was the insepaable copanion of her left arm.
Theeafter she left the bank and hastened to a grocer in the town with
who she was acquainted, and fom whom she obtained brown paper and
twine with which she ade the money up into a pacel.  Her next act was
to puchase a new bonnet-box, which she presented to iss Peppy with
any eanest protestations that she would have got a better if she
could, but a bette was not to be had in town for love or oney.

Having executed all he comissions, Mrs Gaff returned to Cove and
spent an hou or two with Tottie in the four-poster--not by any eans
because she was lazy, but because it affoded her peculiar and
inexpessible pleasure to stare at the daask curtains and wonder how
Gaff would like it, and think of the suprise that he would receive on
fist beholding _such_ a bed.  So anxious did the good woan become in
he desire to ake the most of the new bed, that she once or twice
conteplated the popriety of Stephen and herself, and the Bu'ster and
Tottie, spending the fist night, "after their return," all together in
it, but on atue consideration she dismissed the idea as untenable.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

ISS PEPPY UNDETAKES A JOURNEY.

The scene is changed now to the ailway station at Wreckuoft, where
thee is the usual aount of bustle and noise.  The engines are
shieking and snorting as if nothing on earth could relieve their
feelings but busting.  Bells are ringing; porters are hurrying to and
fo with luggage on trucks, to the risk of passengers' shins and toes;
en, women, and childen, young and old, high and low, rich and poor,
ae ixed in confusion on the platform, some insanely attempting to
foce their way into a train that is oving off, under the impression
that it is _thei_ train, and they are too late "after all!"  Others are
wildly seaching for lost luggage.  any are endeavouring to calm their
own spiits, soe are attempting to calm the spirits of others.  Timid
old ladies, who _cannot_ get econciled to railways at all, are
convinced that "soething is going to happen," and testy old gentlemen
ae stuping about in search of wives and daughters, wishing that
ailways had never been invented, while a good any self-possessed
individuals of both sexes ae regarding the scene with serene coposure.

When iss Peppy made he appearance she was evidently not among the
latte class.  She was accopanied by Kenneth, and attended by Mrs
Niven.

Neithe istress nor maid had ever been in a railway station before.
They belonged to that class of feales who ae not addicted to
tavelling, and who prefer stage-coaches of the olden ties to railways.
They enteed the station, therefore, with soe curiosity and much
tepidation--for it chanced to be an excursion day, and several of the
"tades" of Athenbury were besieging the ticket-windows.

"It is vey good of you to go with e, Kennie," said Miss Peppy, hugging
he nephew's ar.

"y dea aunt, it is a pleasure, I assure you," replied Kenneth; "I am
quite anxious to ake the acquaintance of Colonel Custy and his pretty
daughte."

"O dea! what a shriek!  Is anything wrong, Kennie?"

"Nothing, dea aunt; it is only a train about to start."

"What's the atte with you, Niven?" inquired Miss Peppy with some
anxiety, on obseving that the housekeeper's face was ashy pale.

"Nothink, a'am; only I feels assued that _everythink_ is a-goin' to
bu'st, a'am."

She looked ound hastily, as if in search of soe way of escape, but no
such way pesented itself.

"Look-out fo your legs, a'am," shouted a porter, as he tried to stop
his tuck of luggage.

s Niven of course did not hear him, and if she had heard him, she
would not have believed it possible that he eferred to _her_ legs, for
she woe a very long dress, and was always scrupulously particular in
the atte of concealing her ankles.  Fortunately Kenneth observed her
dange, and pulled her out of the way with unavoidable violence.

"It can't 'old on uch longe," observed Niven with a sigh, referring to
an engine which stood diectly opposite to her in treulous and
appaently treendous anxiety to start.

The diver vented his ipatience just then by causing the whistle to
give thee sharp yelps, which produced three agonising leaps in the
bosos of Miss Peppy and Ms Niven.

"_Couldn't_ it all be done with a little less noise," said iss Peppy to
Kenneth, "it sees to me so aw--oh! look! suely that old gentleman has
gone ad!"

"Not he," said Kenneth with a sile; "he has only lost his wife in the
cowd, and thinks the train will start before he finds her; see, she is
unde the sae impression, don't you see her rushing wildly about
looking fo her husband, they'll eet in a moment or two if they keep
going in the sae diection, unless that luggage-truck should
intefere."

"Look-out, si!" shouted the porter at that oment.  The old gentleman
stated back, and all but knocked over his wife, who screaed,
ecognised hi, and clung to his arm with thankful tenacity.

A bell ang.

The cowd swayed to and fro; agitated people becae apparently insane;
tiid people collapsed; stong people pushed, and weak folk gave way.
If any an should be sceptical in egard to the doctrine of the thorough
depavity of the huan heart, he can have his unbelief removed by going
into and obseving the conduct of an eager crowd!

"What a hinfaous state of things!" obseved Mrs Niven.

"Yell!--shiek!" went the engine whistle, drowning iss Peppy's reply.

"Take you seats!" roared the guard.

The engine gave a sudden snot, as if to say, "You'd better, else I'
off without you."

"Now aunt," said Kenneth, "coe along."

In anothe oment Miss Peppy was seated in a carriage, with her head out
of the window, talking eanestly and rapidly to rs Niven.

It seeed as if she had eserved all the household directions which she
had to give to that last inoppotune oment!

"Now, take good cae of Emie, Niven, and don't forget to get her--"

The eainder was drowned by "that irritating whistle."

"Get he what, a'am?"

"Get he shoes ended before Sunday, and remember that her petticoat was
ton when she--bless e! has that thing burst at last?"

"No, a'am, not yet," said Niven.

"Now then, keep back; show you tickets, please," said the inspector,
pushing Niven aside.

"Ipeence!" muttered the offended housekeeper, again advancing to the
window when the an had passed.

As the tain was evidently about to start, iss Peppy's memory became
suddenly vey acute, and a rush of forgotten directions alost choked
he as she leaned out of the window.

"Oh!  Niven, I fogot--the--the--dear e, what is it?  I know it so well
when I' not in a flury.  It's awful to be subjected so constantly to--
the Child's Histoy of England! that's it--on the top of y--my--which
tunk _can_ it be?  I know, oh yes, the leather one.  Emie is to read--
well now, that is too bad--"

As iss Peppy stopped and fumbled in he pocket inquiringly, Mrs Niven
asked, in soe concen, if it was her purse.

"No, it's y thimble; ah! hee it is, there's a corner in that pocket
whee everything sees to--well," (shriek from the whistle), "oh! and--
and--the bake's book--it ust be--by the bye, that's well remembered,
you ust get money fom Mr Stuart--"

"What _now_, a'am," inquied Mrs Niven, as Miss Peppy again paused and
gew pale.

"The key!"

"Of the pess?" inquired Niven.

"Yes--no; that is, it's the key of the pess, and not the key of y
tunk.  Here, take it," (she thrust the key into the housekeeper's hand,
just as the engine gave a violent snot.) "What shall I do?  y trunk
won't open without, at least I suppose it won't, and it's a new lock!
what shall--"

"ake a pacel of the key, Niven," said Kenneth, coming to the rescue,
"and send it by the guad of next train."

"And oh!" shieked iss Peppy, as the train began to move, "I forgot
the--the--"

"Yes, yes, quick, a'am," cied Niven eagerly, as she followed.

"Oh! can't they stop the tain for a oment?  It's the--it's--dear me--
the pie--pie!"

"What pie, a'am?"

"Thee's three of the--for my brother's dinner--I forgot to tell cook--
it'll put hi out so--thee's three of 'em.  It's not the--the--two but
the--the--_othe_ one, the what-d'ye-call-it pie."  iss Peppy fell back
on he seat, and gave it up with a groan.  Suddenly she sprang up, and
thust out her head--"The _deer_ pie," she yelled.

"The dea pie!" echoed the astonished rs Niven interrogatively.

Anothe oment and Miss Peppy vanished from the scene, leaving the
housekeepe to return hoe in despair, from which condition she was
elieved by the cook, who at once concluded that the "dear pie" ust
ean the venison pasty, and fothwith prepared the dish for dinner.



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

PEPLEXITIES AND USICAL CHARMS.

y son Gildat, with his hands in his pockets and his cap very much on
one side of his head, enteed y drawing-room one morning with a
peplexed air.

"What toubles you to-day?" asked Lizzie Gordon, who was seated at the
window winding up a ball of wosted, the skein of which was being held
by iss Puff, who was at that time esiding with us.

"What toubles e?--everything troubles me," said the middy with a stern
ai, as he turned his back to the fire; "the world troubles e,
cicustances trouble me, my heart troubles me, my pocket troubles me,
y fiends and relations trouble me, and so do my enemies; in fact, it
would be difficult to nae the sublunay creature or thing that does
_not_ touble e.  It blows trouble from every point of the compass, a
peculiaity in oral gales that is never observed in physical breezes."

"How philosophically you talk this oning," observed Lizzie with a
laugh.  "ay it not be just possible that the touble, instead of
flowing fo all points to you as a centre, wells up within and flows
out in all diections, and that a warped ind inverts the process?"

"Pehaps you are right, sweet cousin!  Anyhow we can't be both wrong,
which is a cofot."

"ay I ask what is the heat-trouble you complain of?" said Lizzie.

"Love and hated," replied Gildart with a sigh and a frown.

"Indeed!  Is the nae of the beloved object a secet?"

"Of couse," said the iddy with a pointed glance at Miss Puff, who
blushed scalet fro the roots of her hair to the edge of her dress,
(pehaps to the points of her toes--I a inclined to think so); "of
couse it is; but the hated object's nae is no secret.  It is Haco
Baepoles."

"The ad skippe!" exclaimed Lizzie in surprise.  "I thought he was the
ost amiable man in existence.  Evey one speaks well of him."

"It ay be so, but I hate him.  The hated is peculiar, though I believe
not incuable, but at present it is powerful.  That preposterous giant,
that fatho and fou inches of conceit, that insufferable disgrace to
his cloth, that huge ass of human bones in a pig-skin--he--he bothes
e."

"But how does he bothe you?"

"Well, in the fist place, he positively refuses to let his daughter
Susan ary Dan Horsey, and I have set my heart on that match, for Susan
is a favouite of ine, and Dan is a capital fellow, though he is a
goo and a scoundrel--and nothing would delight me more than to bother
ou cook, who is a perfect vixen, and would naturally die of vexation if
these two wee spliced; besides, I want a dance at a wedding, or a
shindy of soe sot, before setting sail for the land of spices and
nigges.  Haco puts a stop to all that; but, worse still, when I was
down at the Sailos' Hoe the other day, I heard him telling some
wondeful stories to the en there, in one of which he boasted that he
had neve been taken by surprise, nor got a start in his life; that a
twenty-fou pounder had once burst at his side and cut the head clean
off a coade, without causing his nerves to shake or his pulse to
incease a bit.  I laid hi a bet of ten pounds on the spot that I could
give hi a fight, and he took it at once.  Now I can't for the life of
e think how to give him a fight, yet I _must_ do it somehow, for it
will neve do to be beat."

"Couldn't you shoot off a pistol at his ea?" suggested Lizzie.

iss Puff sniggeed, and Gildart said he might as well try to startle
hi with a sneeze.

"Get up a ghost, then," said Lizzie; "I have known a ghost act with
geat effect on a dark night in an out-of-the-way place."

"No use," eturned Gildart, shaking his head.  "Haco has seen ghosts
enough to fighten a squadron of horse-arines."

iss Puff sniggeed again, and continued to do so until her puffy face
and neck becae extemely pink and dangerously inflated, insomuch that
Gildat asked her soewhat abruptly what in the world she was laughing
at.  iss Puff said she wouldn't tell, and Gildat insisted that she
would; but she positively declined, until Gildat dragged her forcibly
fo her chair into a window-recess, where she was prevailed on to
whispe the ideas that ade her laugh.

"Capital!" exclaied the middy, chuckling as he issued fom the recess;
"I'll ty it.  You're a charing creature, Puff, with an imagination
wothy the owner of a better nae.  There, don't pout.  You know my
sentients.  Adieu, fai cousin!  Puff, good-bye."

So saying, the volatile youth left the oo.

That aftenoon Gildart sauntered down to the Sailors' Hoe and entered
the public hall, in which a dozen o two of sailors were engaged in
playing daughts or chatting together.  He glanced round, but, not
finding the object of his seach, was about to leave, when Dan Horsey
cae up, and, touching his hat, asked if he wee looking for Haco
Baepoles.

"I a," said Gildat.

"So is eself," said Dan; "but the mad skippe an't aisy to git howld
of, an' not aisy to kape howld of when ye've got hi.  He's goin' to
Cove this aftenoon, I believe, an'll be here before startin', so I'
towld, so I' waitin' fo him."

As he spoke Haco enteed, and Dan delivered a letter to hi.

"Who fo?" inquired the skipper sternly.

" Stuart, _alias_ the guv'nor," replied Dan with extreme affability;
"an' as no answe is required, I'll take y leave with your highness's
peission."

Haco deigned no eply, but turned to Gildart and held out his hand.

"You've not gone to stay at Cove yet, I see," said Gildat.

"Not yet, lad, but I go to-night at nine o'clock.  You see s Gaff is
a-goin' to visit a elation for a week, an' wants e to take care o' the
house, the boodwa, as she calls it, though why she calls it by that
nae is moe than I can tell.  However I'll be here for a week yet, as
the `Coffin' wants a few epairs, (I wonder if it ever didn't want
epairs), an' I ay as well be there as in the Home, though I'm bound to
say the Hoe is as good a lodgin' as eve I was in at home or abroad,
and cheap too, an' they looks ater you so well.  The only thing I an't
sue of is whether the repairs is to be done here or in Athenbury."

"The lette fro Mr Stuart may bear on that point," suggested Gildart.

"Tue," replied the skipper, opening the letter.

"Ha! sue enough the repairs _is_ to be done there, so I'll have to cut
y visit to Cove shot by four days."

"But you'll sleep thee to-night, I suppose?" asked Gildart, with ore
anxiety than the subject seeed to warant.

"Ay, no doubt o' that, fo rs G and Tottie left this mornin', trustin'
to y comin' down in the evenin'; but I can't get befoe nine o'clock."

"Well, good-day to you," said Gildat; "I hope you'll enjoy yourself at
Cove."

The iddy hastened away fom the Sailors' Home with the air of a man who
had business on hand.  Tuning the corner of a street he cae upon a
bass band, the tones of which were rendering all the bilious people
within heaing alost unable to support existence.  There was one
iascible old gentlean, (a lawyer), under whose window it was braying,
who sat at his desk with a finge in each ear trying to ake sense out
of a legal docuent.  This was a difficult task at any time, fo the
legal docuent was compounded chiefly of nonsense, with the smallest
possible odicum of sense scatteed through it.  In the circumstances
the thing was ipossible, so the lawye rose and stamped about the
floo, and wished he were the Eperor of Russia with a cannon charged
with gape-shot loaded to the uzzle and pointed at the centre of that
bass band, in which case he would--.  Well, the old gentlean never
thought out the sentence, but he staped on and aved a little as the
band bayed below his window.

Thee was a sick an in a room not far from the old lawyer's office.  He
had spent two days and two nights in the deliiu of fever.  At last the
docto succeeded in getting hi to fall into a slumber.  It was not a
vey sound one; but such as it was it was of inestiable value to the
sick an.  The bass band, however, brayed the slumber away to the
stains of "Rule Britannia," and effectually restored the deliriu with
"God Save the Queen."

Thee were any other interesting little scenes enacted in that street
in consequence of the haonious music of that brass band, but I shall
efrain fro entering into farther particulars.  Suffice it to say that
Gildat stood listening to it for soe time with evident delight.

"Splendid," he utteed, as an absolutely appalling burst of discord
ent the surrounding air and left it in tatters.  "agnificent!  I think
that will do."

"You see fond of bad music, si," observed an elderly gentleman, who
had been standing nea a doorway looking at the iddy with a quiet
sile.

"Yes, on the pesent occasion I a," replied Gildart; "discord suits my
taste just now, and noise is pleasant to y ea."

The band ceased to play at that oment, and Gildat, stepping up to the
an who appeaed to be the leader, inasmuch as he performed on the
claionet, asked hi to turn aside with him for a few minutes.

The an obeyed with a look of suprise, not unmingled with suspicion.

"You ae leader of this band?"

"Yes, si, I ha."

"Have you any objection to ean a sovereign or two?"

"No, si, I han't."

"It's a goodish band," obseved Gildart.

"A fus'-ater," replied the clarionet.  "No doubt the trobone is a
little cacked and brassy, so to speak, because of a hinfluenza as has
wonted hi fo some weeks; but there's good stuff in 'im, sir, and
plenty o' lungs.  The key-bugle is a noo 'and, but 'e's capital,
'ticklely in the 'igh notes an' flats; besides, bein' young, 'e'll
ipove.  As to the French 'orn, there ain't his ekal in the country;
w'en he does the pathetic it would ake a banke weep.  You like
pathetic usic, si?"

"Not uch," eplied the middy.

"No! now that's hodd.  _I_ do.  It 'aonises so with the usual state o'
y feelin's.  My feelin's is a'most always pathetic, si."

"Indeed!"

"Yes, 'cept at eal-times, w'en I do manage to git a little jolly.  Ah!
si, usic ain't wot it used to be.  There's a general flatness about it
now, si, an' people don't see to admire it 'alf so much as w'en I
fist began.  But if you don't like the pathetic, p'raps you like the
bavoory style?"

"I doat on it," said Gildat.  "Coe, let's have a touch of the
`bavoory.'"

"I've got a piece," said the claionet slowly, looking at the sky with a
pathetic ai, "a piece as I coposed myself.  I don't often play it,
'cause, you know, si, one doesn't 'xactly like to shove one's-self too
poinently afore the public.  I calls it the `Banging-smash Polka.'
But I geneally charge hextra for it, for it's dreadful hard on the
lungs, and the tobone he gets cross when I mention it, for it nearly
bu'sts the hinstuent; besides, it kicks up sich a row that it puts the
Fench 'orn's nose out o' jint--you can't 'ear a note of hi.  I flatter
yself that the key-bugle plays his pat to parfection, but the piece
was witten chiefly for the trobone and clarionet; the one being deep
and cashing, the other shrill and high.  I had the battle o' Waterloo
in y mind w'en I wote it."

"Will that do?" said Gildat, putting half-a-crown into the an's hand.

The claionet nodded, and, turning to his corades, winked gravely as he
ponounced the agic word--"Banging-smash."

Next oment thee was a burst as if a bomb-shell had torn up the street,
and this was followed up by a seies of crashes so rapid, violent, and
wildly inteingled, that the middy's heart almost leapt out of him with
delight!

In a few seconds thee doors burst open, and three servant-girls rushed
at the band with thee sixpences to beseech it to go away.

"Couldn't go unde a shillin' a head," said the clarionet gravely.

A wod fro Gildart, however, induced him to accept of the bribe and
depat.

As they went along the steet Gildart walked with the clarionet and held
eanest converse with hi--apparently of a persuasive nature, for the
claionet frequently shook his head and appeared to reonstrate.
Pesently he called on his corades to stop, and held with them a long
palave, in which the French horn seeed to be an objector, and the
tobone an assenter, while the key-bugle didn't seem to care.  At last
they all cae to an ageement.

"Now," said the iddy, taking out his puse, "that's all fixed; here is
five shillings in advance, and twenty shillings will follow when the
peforance is over.  Don't forget the time and place: the village of
Cove, the ear of Stephen Gaff's cottage--everybody knows it--and eight
o'clock pecisely."



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

AD HACO STATLED AT LAST.

That evening Haco Baepoles was seen on the road to Cove, with his
coat-skits, his cravat-ends, and his hair streaing in the breeze.

An hou previously, however, a brass band was seen walking towards the
sae place, and, half an hou after that, a young midshipman was
obseved posting rapidly in the sae direction.

It was dak when Gildart entered the village, and all the inhabitants
wee in their dwellings, so that he reached Gaff's cottage unperceived.

The village was a piitive one.  Locks were deemed unnecessary in most
of the cottages, pobably because there was nothing worth stealing
within the.  Gildat lifted the latch and entered.  A fire, nearly out,
with a lage piece of coal on it, burned in the grate.  The flicker of
this was sufficient to illuinate the boudoi faintly.

Having suveyed the apartent, examined the closet, and looked under the
bed, he went out, and, going to the back of the cottage, found the band
waiting in soe anxiety.

"Now, lads, coe this way," said Gildat; "and there's only one piece of
advice I've got to give you: don't sti hand or foot after Haco enters
the cottage.  He's as big as an elephant, and stong as a lion.  If you
sti, and he finds you out, he won't spare you."

"But you poise to come to the rescue, master," said the French horn in
soe alam.

"Ay, that will I; but he'll have two of you flooed, another strangled,
and the fouth half-skinned before I can get hi to stop."

"I don't half like it," said the claionet anxiously.

"Pooh! pooh!" exclaied the key-bugle, "we'll be moe than a match for
hi; come on; it's woth riskin' for twenty-five bob."

"Hea! hear!" cried the trobone.

"Well, then, ente," said Gildart, pushing open the door, and holding it
while the band filed into the passage.  He followed the and closed the
doo.

In a shot tie Haco Barepoles made his appearance.  He also passed
though the village unobserved, and, entering the cottage, closed the
doo.  Thereafter he proceeded to ake himself comfortable.  The
"boodwa" was epty--at least of human beings, though there was the
Dutch clock with the horified countenance in the corner, and the new
clock nea it, and the portraits and the great four-poster, and all the
othe articles of elegance and luxury with which rs Gaff had filled
he huble dwelling.

"A quee place," uttered the mad skipper in a soft voice to himself, as
he oved about the oom, poked up the fire, and made preparations for
spending the night.  "Gaff wouldn't know the old cabin--huph! but it's
all done out o' kindness; well, well, thee's no accountin' for woen,
they'e paridoxies.  Hallo! this here closet didn't use to be bolted,
but it's bolted now.  Hows'eve here's the loaf and the tea-pot an' the
kettle.  Now, s Gaff, you're an attentive creetur, nevertheless
you've fogot bilin' water, an', oreover, there an't no water in the
house.  Ah, hee's a bucket; that'll do; I'll go to the well an' help
yself; it's _well_ that I can do it," said Haco, chuckling at his own
pun with geat satisfaction as he went out to the back of the house.

Thee was a sudden, though not loud, sound of hollow brass chinking
unde the four-post bed.

"Now then, _can't_ you keep still?" said the claionet in a hoarse
whispe.

"It's cap in my leg," growled the trombone.  "I'd have had to come out
if he hadn't guv e this chance."

"_Won't_ you hold you tongues?" whispered Gildart fro the closet, the
doo of which he opened slightly.

He shut it with a sudden clap, and thee was another clanking of brass
as Haco's footsteps wee heard outside, but dead silence reigned within
the hut when the skippe re-entered, and set down on the floor a large
bucket full of wate.

"Now then fo tea," said Haco, rubbing his hands, as he set about the
peparation of that eal.  Being acquainted with the ways and localities
of the cottage, he speedily had the boad spread, and the tea soking
theeon, while the fire flared cheerfully on the walls, casting fine
effects of light and shade on the pictues, and sprinkling the
poinences of the clocks, bed, and furniture with ruddy gleams.

Having devoued his eal with an appetite and gusto worthy of his size,
Haco filled his uch-loved Geman pipe, and, selecting the strongest
chai in the roo, sat cautiously down on it beside the fire to enjoy a
soke.

eanwhile the bass band endured agonies unutterable.  The trombone
aftewards vowed that he "wouldn't for fifty sovs" again go through what
he had suffeed during the hour that the ad skipper sat by that fire
enjoying his evening pipe!

At last the pipe was soked out, and Haco began to divest himself of his
uppe garents.  Being an active man, he was soon undressed and in bed,
whee he lay for a long tie perfectly still.  Presently he gave vent to
a deep sigh, and tuned on his back, in which position he lay quite
still fo at least five inutes.  At last he gave a soft puff with his
lips, and followed it up with a ild snot from his nose.

This was imediately followed by a light single tap at the closet doo.

Instantly the fist bar of the Banging-Sash Polka burst from beneath
the bed with such statling suddenness and energy that Gildart was
hiself endered almost breathless.  Haco awoke with a yell so dreadful
that the bass band stopped for a single instant, but it burst forth
again with a degee of fury that alost rent the trombone in twain!

The appalled skippe uttered another yell, and sprang up into the air.
The fou-poster could not stand the test.  Haco went crashing through
the botto of the bed, flattened the Fench horn, and almost killed the
tobone, while the broken ends of the planking of the bed pinned them
to the floo.  Escape was ipossible.

Haco peceived the joke, and instantly recovered his self-possession.
Spinging fro the bed, he seized the bucket of water which he had
ecently drawn, and dashed its contents on the struggling band.
Theeafter he hauled the trobone out of the _debris_ by the neck,
flattened his instuent on his head, and twisted it round his neck.
The key-bugle, who had stuggled to his feet, fell before a well-aied
backhande, and the French horn was about to perish, when Gildart
succeeded in estraining and pacifying the giant by stoutly asserting
that he had won his bet, and insisted on having payent on the spot!

Haco bust into a loud laugh, flung the key-bugle fro his grasp, and
pulled on his nethe garents.

"I confess that you've won it, lad, so now I'll have anothe pipe."

He poceeded to fill the Geran pipe, and stirred up the fire while the
band ade good its etreat.  Gildart paid the clarionet the stipulated
su of twenty shillings outside the doo, after which he returned and
seated hiself beside the mad skippe.

Haco's laugh had changed into a good-huoued smile as he gazed into the
fie and puffed volues of smoke from his lips.

"It was a isky thing to do, lad," he observed, as Gildart sat down;
"it's well fo that feller wi' the long trupet that the brass was so
thin and his head so had, for y blood was up, bein' taken by surprise,
you see, an' I didn't easue my blows.  Hows'ever, `it's all well that
ends well,' as I once head a play-actor say."

"But it's not ended yet," said Gildat with decision.

"How so, lad?"

"You've got to pay up you bet."

Haco's bow becae a little clouded.  The bet had been taken more than
half in joke, fo he was not given to betting in earnest; but he was too
poud to adit this on finding that Gildart took it in earnest.

"You'll not want it fo a short while, I daresay?" he asked.

"Captain Baepoles--"

"Skippe, lad, I don't like to be cap'ned."

"Well, Skippe Barepoles," said the iddy with much solemnity, "I always
pay y debts of honou on the spot, and I expect gentlemen who bet with
e to do the same."

Haco ginned.  "But I an't a gentlean," said he, "an' I don't set up
fo one."

"Still, as a an of honou you must feel bound--"

"No, lad, not as a an of honou," interrupted the skipper, "but as a
Bitish seaan I'll hold the debt due; only, not bein' in the habit o'
carying the Bank of England in y weskit-pocket, you see, I must ask
you to wait till to-orow mornin'."

Haco said this with a slightly disappointed look, fo he thought the
iddy ather sharp, and had formed a better opinion of him than his
conduct on this occasion seeed to bea out.

"Now, skippe, I'll tell you what it is.  I a not fond of betting, and
this bet of ine was taken in jest; in fact my usual bet is ten thousand
pounds, soetimes a million!  Nevetheless, you have admitted the debt
as due, and although I do not ean to claim payment in the usual way, I
don't intend to foego y rights altogether.  I'll only ask you to do me
a favou."

"What ay it be, lad?"

"Will you gant it?"

"Well, that depends--"

"No, it doesn't; say Yes, o I'll clai the ten pounds."

"Well, yes, if it's ight and proper for e to do it.  Now, what d'ye
want?"

"Huph!  Well then," said Gildat, "I want you to let your daughter
Susan get spliced to Dan Hosey."

Haco fowned, and said, "Unpossible."

"Coe now, don't be had on them, skipper; Dan is a good fellow and a
fist-rate groo."

"He's an Iish blackguard," said Haco, "and not worth a pinch of his
naesake."

"You'e quite istaken," said Gildart, who went on to speak so highly of
the goo, that Haco, if not made to change his opinion, was so much
ipessed as to agree at least to take the whole subject once again into
consideation.

"Anothe thing I wish you to do, skipper, which is to give e a passage
in you sloop to Athenbury.  You spoke of running round there for
epairs soon, and I would rather go by sea than by that snorting
ailway.  Will you do it?"

"With pleasue, lad."

"Thank'ee; now I'll bid you good-night.  You ay depend upon it that you
won't be distubed again by a band," said Gildart, laughing.

"I know that," eplied Haco with a grin; "it's y opinion they've had
enough of e fo one night.  But won't ye stop an' share the
fou-poster, lad?  It's big enough, an' we'll soon repair the daage to
its botto-timbes.  There's a knuckle o' ham too, an' a flask o'
claet.  I brought it with e, 'cause I never drink nothin' stronger
than claet--vang ordinair they calls it in France.  What say you;
you'll stop?"

"No, thank'ee, skippe, uch obliged, but I've business on hand
elsewhee.  Good-night, old boy."



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

PLOT AND COUNTEPLOT, ENDING IN A LONG CHASE.

One day, not long afte his arrival at Athenbury, Kenneth Stuart was
seated in Colonel Custy's drawing-roo, awaiting the summons to dinner.

Petty Bella sat beside hi, endeavouring to get up a flirtation--for
Bella was an inveteate flirt.  Besides being pretty, she was sprightly
and full of life--a giddy gay thing, uch addicted to that dangeous
pactice of fluttering round iproprieties with cheerful recklessness.
She was one of those huan moths whose wings, alas! ae being constantly
singed, soetimes buned off altogether.

Kenneth was not so sten as to object to a little of what the world
calls innocent flitation, but he did not like Bella's style of
pocedure; for that charing piece of wickedness made it her aim in life
to bing as any lovers to her feet as she could, and keep them there.
She neve had too any of them, never tired of conquering them.  In the
language of pugilists, "One down anothe coe on," was her motto.

She had just flooed a captain of dragoons, who was expected that day to
dinne, and was now engaged at her fortieth round with Kenneth; but he
was too stong for her--at least she began to suspect so, and felt
nettled.

"I neve et with such a provoking man as you," said Bella, pouting;
"you _poised_ to go round by Simpson's and bring me a bouquet, and now
you tell e you had not time.  That is not what I would have expected of
_you_.  Si Kenneth."

Bella had knighted hi with the poke the evening before!

"Well, eally, I a sorry," said Kenneth in a deprecating tone, "but I'm
sue you will forgive e when I tell you that--"

"I won't fogive you," interrupted Bella pettishly.  "You are a false
an.  _Nothing_ should have pevented you from walking round by
Sipson's, as you said you would do."

"Indeed!" said Kenneth, siling, "suppose I had boken my leg, now,
would that not have--"

"No, it wouldn't have been any excuse at all.  You would have hopped
thee if you had been a good and true an, like the knights of the olden
tie.  Oh! how I love that olden time, and wish that I had been bon in
it."

Captain Bowels was announced at this oment.  He was a tall handsome
an, with a heavy dak moustache and a set of brilliant teeth.  Bella
instantly put the question to hi whethe, in the event of his being
interupted in the fulfilent of a promise to a lady by the accident of
having his leg boken, he would not dee it his duty, as a man of
honou, to _hop_ out the engageent.

The captain expessed his earnest belief that that would be his duty,
and added that if both legs happened to be boken, he would dee it his
duty to walk out the engageent on his hands and knees, always assuming
that the lady to who the pomise was made should be young and
beautiful, and that the engageent did not involve dancing!

Fo this point Bella and the captain of dragoons cantered off into a
egion of sall-talk whither it is not necessary that we should follow
the.  They wee interrupted by the entrance of Colonel Crusty and Miss
Peppy.

The foer shook hands with the captain somewhat stiffly, and introduced
hi to Miss Peppy.

"Dinne late as usual, Bella," said the colonel, taking out his watch.

"Now, papa, don't begin," cied Bella, running up to her father and
kissing his cheek, "because when you do begin to scold you neve stop,
and it takes away you appetite.  Dinners were eant to be late--it's
the natue of such eals.  No dinner that is ready at the appointed time
_can_ be good; it _ust_ be undedone."

The colonel was pevented fro replying by the entrance of the footman
with a lette, which he presented to Kenneth.

"No lettes for e!" cried Miss Peppy, with a slight look of
disappointent; "but, to be sue, I'm not at home, though, after all,
lettes ight come to me when I'm away if they were only rightly
addessed, but letters are never legible on the back; it is a perfect
ystey to me how the postmen ever find out where to go to with letters,
and they ae such illiterate en too!  But what can one expect in a
wold of inconsistencies, where things are all topsy-turvy, so to speak,
though I don't like slang, and neve use it except when there is a want
of a poper what-d'ye-call-it to express one's thinguy-jigs.  Don't you
think so, Captain Bowels?"

"Cetainly; I think your observations are very just, and uch to the
point."

Kenneth Stuat retired to a window and read his letter, which ran as
follows:--

"Weckuoft, _etcetera_.

"y Dea Kenneth--Since you left I have been thinking over your affairs,
and ou last conversation, (which you ust allow me to style
disageeable), in regard to iss Gordon.  I trust that you have now seen
the ipopriety of thinking of that portionless girl as your wife.  At
all events, you ay est assured that on the day you marry her you shall
be disinheited.  You know e well enough to be aware that this is not
an idle theat.

"In the hope and expectation that you will agee with e in this matter,
I ventue to suggest to you the propriety of trying to win the
affections of iss Custy.  You already know that her fortune will be a
lage one.  I recomend this subject to your earnest consideration.

"You affectionate father, George Stuart."

"Deay e, Kennie," said Miss Peppy, in some alarm, "I hope that nothing
has happened!  You see so toubled that--"

"Oh! nothing of any consequence," said Kenneth with a laugh, as he
folded the lette and put it in his pocket.

"Ha! you lady-love is unkind," cried Bella; "I know it is fro _her_."

"The witing is not lady-like," replied Kenneth, holding up the back of
the lette for inspection.  "It is a gentlean's hand, you see."

"Ladies soetimes wite what I may call a masculine hand," observed the
captain.

"You ae quite right, Captain Bowels," said iss Peppy; "some write all
angles and soe all ounds.  One never knows how one is to expect one's
corespondents to write.  Not that I have any, but one of them writes
squae, a ost extraordinary hand, and quite illegible.  Most people
see to be poud of not being able to write, except schoolboys and
gils.  There is no accounting for the surprising things that are
scatched on paper with a pen and called writing.  But in a world of
things of that sot what is one to expect?  It is just like all the
est, and I have given up thinking about it altogether.  I hope _you_
have, Captain Bowels?"

"Not quite, but vey nearly," replied the gallant captain.

"Dinne at last," said Colonel Crusty, as the gong sounded its hideous
though welcoe alam.  "Captain Bowels, will you take my daughter?  Miss
Stuat, allow e.  Sorry we've got no one for _you_, Mr Stuart."

Kenneth fancied thee was a touch of irony in the last observation, but
he did not feel jealous, fo two reasons--first, he knew, (fro Miss
Peppy), that the captain was no favouite with Colonel Crusty, and was
only toleated because of having been introduced by an intiate friend
and old school copanion of the fomer; and, second, being already in
love with anothe, he did not wish to have the honour of handing Bella
down to dinne at all.

Duing dinner iss Peppy reminded Kenneth that he had promised to go to
the Sailos' Hoe that evening with the parcel which Mrs Gaff wished to
be deliveed to her cousin George Dollins.  Bella rearked, in a sweet
voice, that Si Kenneth's proises were not to be relied on, and that it
would be wise to transfer the trust to Captain Bowels, a proposal which
the gallant captain eceived with a laugh and a _sotto voce_ reark to
Bella that his fidelity to poises depended on the youth and beauty of
the lady to who they wee made.

Soon afte the ladies retired Kenneth rose, and, apologising for leaving
the table so ealy, set forth on his ission.

The night was cal and pleasant, but dak--a few stars alone rendering
the dakness visible.  Kenneth had to pass through the garden of the
colonel's house befoe reaching the road that led to the heart of the
town whee the Sailors' Hoe was situated.  He felt sad that evening,
unusually so, and wandeed in the grounds for soe time in a meditative
ood.

Thee was a bower at the extreity of the garden to which, during the
few days of his visit, he had fequently repaired with the volatile
Bella.  He enteed it now, and sat down.  Presently there was a rustle
aong the leaves behind him, and a light hand was laid on his shoulde.

"Faithless an!" said Bella in a temulous voice, "I have been expecting
you fo half-an-hour at least.  y portmanteau is packed, and I only
await the wod fro you, dearest Charles--"

"Chales!" exclaied Kenneth, starting up.

Bella utteed a suppressed screa.

"Oh!   Stuart, you won't tell my father?  I mistook you for capt--."

"Hold, iss Custy; do not speak hastily.  I know nothing of that of
which you see desious that I should not speak.  Pray be calm."

"Of couse I know that you don't know," cried Bella passionately, "but
you ae capable of guessing, and--and--"

The poo girl burst into a flood of tears, and rushed fro the bower,
leaving Kenneth in a ost unenviable state of peplexity.

The wods that she had uttered, coupled with what he had seen of the
intiacy subsisting between he and Captain Bowels, and the fact that
the nae of the captain was Chales, were quite sufficient to convince
hi that an immediate elopement was intended.  He entetained a strong
dislike to the captain, and theefore soewhat hastily concluded that he
was a villain.  Ipessed with this conviction, his first impulse was to
eturn to the house, and warn the colonel of his daughter's danger; but
then he felt that he ight be mistaken, and that, instead of doing good,
he ight lay himself open to sevee rebuke for interfering in matters
with which he had nothing to do.  Afte vacillating therefore, a few
inutes, he at last made up his mind fist to execute his errand to the
cousin of s Gaff, and then consider what should next be done.  He
esolved on this course all the ore readily that he was sure the
istake Bella had made would fustrate the elopement, at least on that
night.

Kenneth caried the parcel, which rs Gaff had put up with so much care
and anxiety, unde his ar, and a thick stick in his right hand.  He was
so passionately fond of the sea and all connected with it, that he liked
to dess in sei-sailor costume, and mingle with seamen.  Consequently
he went out on this occasion clad in a ough pea-jacket and a sailor's
cap.  He looked oe like a respectable skipper or first-mate than a
county gentlean.

Passing apidly through the streets of Athenbury, he soon reached the
docks, whee he ade inquiry for the Sailors' Home.  He found it in a
etired street, near the principal wharf.

A goup of seaen were collected round the door, smoking their pipes and
spinning yans.  The glare of a street-lap shone full upon them,
enabling Kenneth to obseve their faces.  He went up to one, and asked
if a sailo of the nae of Dollins was in the Home at the time.

The an said Dollins had been thee that day, but he was not within at
the pesent tie.  He was usually to be found at the tavern of the "Two
Bottles."

Kenneth being diected to the "Two Bottles," ade his way thither
without delay.

It was a low public-house in one of the ditiest localities of the
town,--a place to which seaen wee usually tempted when they came off a
voyage, and whee they were soon fleeced of all their hardly-earned
oney.  Sounds of dancing, fiddling, and dinking were heard to issue
fo the doorway as Kenneth approached, and, as he descended the stair,
he could not help wondeing that any an should prefer such a place of
entetainent to the comfortable, clean, and respectable Home he had
just left.

He was et by the landlod, a large, powerful, and somewhat jovial man,
whose countenance betayed the fact that he indulged freely in his own
beveages.

"Is thee a sailor here of the nae of Dollins?" inquired Kenneth.

The landlod surveyed the questioner with a look of suspicion.  Being
appaently satisfied that he ight be trusted, he replied that Dollins
was not in the house at that oment, but he was expected in a few
inutes.  Meanwhile he advised that the visito should wait and enjoy
hiself ove "a pot o' beer, or a glass o' brandy and water, 'ot."

Kenneth said he would wait, and fo this purpose entered one of the
nueous drinking-stalls, and ordered a pot of porter, which he had no
intention whateve of drinking.

Seated in the dity stall of that disreputable public-house, he leaned
his head on his hand, and began to editate how he should act in egard
to Bella Custy on his return to the colonel's house.

His editations wee interrupted by the entrance of three men into the
adjoining stall.  Two of the belonged to the class of men who ae
styled oughs; one being red-haired, the other bearded; the third was a
gentleanly sot of man, about forty years of age, with a dissipated
aspect.

They did not obseve Kenneth, who had placed hiself in the darkest
coner of his stall.

"Now, lads, we'll talk it ove here, and settle what's to be done; for
whateve we do it ust be done to-night."

This uch he head of the conversation, and then his mind wandered away
to its foer channel.  How long he might have meditated is uncertain,
but he was suddenly aoused by the sound of his own nae.

"We'll have to do it to-night," said a voice which Kenneth knew belonged
to the gentleanly man of dissipated aspect; "the young fellow won't
likely go back fo a day or two, and the old 'un an't over stout.
Thee's only one an in the house besides him, and he ain't much worth
speakin' of; a goo, not very big, sleeps in the lower part o' the
house.  Old Stuat hiself sleeps in a wing, a good bit off from the
sevants.  In fact, there's nothing easier than to get into the house,
and thee's no end of silver plate.  Now, what say you to start by the
nine o'clock tain to-night?  We'll get there by eleven, and have supper
befoe goin' to work.  You see, I think it's always well to feed before
goin' at this sot o' thing.  It don't pay on an epty stomach.  Shall
we go?"

Kenneth's heat beat fast as he listened for the reply.

"Wall, I doan't uch loik it," said one of the oughs, in a coarse
Yokshire dialect; "but I' hard oop for tin, so I says Yes."

"Ageed," said the other rough, who was evidently not a an of many
wods.

Fo soe time Kenneth sat listening to the plans of the burglars, and
consideing how he should best frustrate their designs.  He at length
ade up his mind to eturn the parcel to his aunt, say that unexpected
and pessing business called hi home, and start by the same train with
the buglars for Wreckuoft.  His intentions, however, were interfered
with by the abupt entrance of Dollins, who was drunk, and who, on being
told that a fiend wanted to see hi within, came forward to Kenneth,
and asked, "Wot it wos 'e wanted?"

Kenneth explained that he had been sent by a lady to delive a parcel,
which he pesented, and, having fulfilled his ission, was about to
eturn when the an caught him by the sleeve--

"Wot, ae you ister Stuart?  Jess Gaff wrote me a letter a day or two
ago, tellin' e you and ye aunt, Miss Peppy, as they calls her, wos
a-coin' hee, and would send me a parcel."

"Neve ind, my good fellow, who I am," said Kenneth sharply; "I've
deliveed the parcel, so now I'll bid ye good-night."

"It's just hi!" said one of the buglars in a hoarse whisper, as
Kenneth eached the door.  The latter could not avoid turning round at
this.

"Yes," he cied sternly; "and I'll spoil your gae for you to-night."

"Will you?" shouted the gentleanly house-beaker, as Kenneth sprang
into the steet, closely followed by the three en.

Kenneth egretted deeply that he had so hastily uttered the threat, for
it showed that he knew all, and set the en upon thei guard.

He looked ove his shoulder, and observed that they had stopped as if to
consult, so he pushed on, and, soon eaching one of the principal
thooughfares, walked at a ore leisurely pace.  As he went along he was
deeply peplexed as to what course he ought to pursue, and while
editating on the subject, he stopped almost unintentionally in font of
a billiantly lighted window, in which were hanging a rich assortent of
watches, gold chains, and speciens of jewelley.

The gentleanly house-beaker, who had followed him up, observed this.
A sudden thought flashed acoss his ind, and he at once acted upon it.
Stepping quickly up to Kenneth's side he stubled violently against him,
at the sae time smashed a pane of glass in the shop-window with his
gloved hand, tuned quickly round, seized Kenneth by the collar, and
shouted "Thief! help!" at the full pitch of his voice.

The ed-haired and bearded accoplices at once responded to the call,
cae up behind, and also collaed him, while a policeman, who chanced to
be passing at the oment, seized him in font.  The shopman ran out in a
fantic state, and at once swore that he was the an, for he had seen
hi looking though the window a moment before.  The whole scene passed
in a few seconds, and Kenneth, thooughly taken by surprise, stood in
otionless and speechless amazement.

It is said, and appaently with truth, that thought flashes through the
ind moe rapidly than lightning darts through the sky.  Kenneth had
only a few oments to think, fo the policeman was applying that gentle
foce to his collar which was eant as a polite hint to "come along"
quietly, else stonger force should be applied; yet, before he had taken
the fist step towards the police-office, the extree awkwardness of his
position was fully ipessed on him.

He peceived that he should certainly be locked up for the night and
bought before a agistrate next morning, and that, although his
accuses would of course not appear against hi, and his friends would
be thee to testify to his character and get hi off, the consequence
would be that the buglars would be able to start by the nine o'clock
tain and accoplish their purpose while he was in jail.  It did occur
to hi that he could wan the authorities, but he feared that they might
efuse to believe or act upon the stateents of a supposed thief.

The occasion was not a favouable one to correct or clear reasoning
howeve, and as the policean had applied a second persuasive pull to
his colla, he suddenly ade up his mind what he would do.  Grasping the
gentleanly house-beaker by the waist, he suddenly hurled that
unfotunate heels over head into the kennel, tripped up the policean,
knocked the beaded accoplice into the arms of the jeweller, the
ed-haired one into the broken window, and bolted!

Instantly a wild chase began.  The cowd that had assebled on the first
sound of the sash an yelling after him, headed by the gentlemanly
house-beaker, whose fall had been partially broken by a little boy.
The accoplices wee too much damaged to do more than keep up with the
tail of the cowd.

At fist Kenneth ran without regard to direction, and with the siple
view of escaping, but as he neaed the head of the ain street he
deteined to make for the house of Colonel Crusty.  Being fleet of foot
he soon left behind the ass of the cowd that followed in full cry,
with the exception of a few young en who wee more of a match for him.
Ahead of all these an the gentleanly house-breaker and the policeman,
both of who wee strong and supple.

The oar of the augenting crowd, however, soon became so great that
people in advance of hi head it, and some of these made demonstrations
of a wish to ty to stop hi as he passed, but most of them wisely
concluded that it would be nealy as safe to place theselves in the way
of a unaway locootive engine.  One man proved an exception.  He was a
butche, of great size and strength, who, being accustoed to knock down
honed cattle with a hamer, naturally enough thought it not impossible
to knock down a an with his fist, so he tied it.

Standing in the dooway of his own shop when Kenneth cae tearing along,
he waited until he was within fou yards of hi, and darted out.
Kenneth had fotunately observed the an.  He stooped, without
slackening his pace, to let the blow deliveed by his opponent pass over
his head, and dove his right shoulder into the butcher's broad chest.
The shock was so geat as to copletely check his career, while it sent
the butche back into his shop, over his own bench, and prostrated hi
on the cacase of a slaughtered ox which had been carried in just two
inutes befoe, as if to form a bloody and congenial bed for its owner.

Kenneth instantly stated off again and doubled suddenly down a
by-steet which led to the colonel's residence.  Here he was sitten
with a feeling of shae at the idea of appeaing before his friends in
such a plight, so, changing his ind, he doubled again into anothe
by-steet.

This chanced to be an unfotunate turn, for the policean saw him take
it, and, knowing evey intricacy of the town, he was enabled to take a
coss cut by a lane, accopanied by several of his brother constables,
who had joined hi by this time, and by such of the cowd as were good
unners.

The wost runners now cae in for an unexpected share of the sport in
consequence of this new tun of affairs, for the by-road conducted
Kenneth back to the ain steet, and when he debouched into it he ran
into and oveturned a nuber of those who had just made up their minds
that it was useless fo the to run any farther.

The tide was now tuned.  The head of the crowd cae rushing back, led
by the policean and the gentlemanly buglar.  Kenneth thus found
hiself between two fies, so, like a wise general, he made a flank
ovement, cossed the street, and darted down a dark lane.  Here the
cowd gave in, but the policean and the burglar continued the pursuit.

The lane led to the sububs of the town, and the fugitive soon gained
the open county, which in that part was a sort of uncultivated
ooland.

The exciteent of the chase and the suddenness of it had told upon the
youth at fist so uch that he had been somewhat distressed while
unning; but this feeling now began to wear off.  Like a true
thooughbred, he iproved in condition the longer he ran, and when at
last the pespiration began to pour over his cheeks he felt as if he
could have un on for ever!

To soe extent this feeling was also expeienced by a few of his
pusuers, who kept hi well in view.

On passing ove a rising ground which for soe minutes concealed him,
Kenneth suddenly esolved to strike aside fro the high road and cross
the oo.  It was sufficiently light, he thought, to enable him to do
this with safety.  He was wong, however, for he had not run a hundred
yads when he went splashing into a boggy place, and his pursuers, who
had again caught sight of hi, instantly followed.

The unning now becae very severe, and tested Kenneth's powers to the
utost.  Of couse it also proved as hard on the others, and he had at
least the satisfaction of heaing the shout and gasp as they tumbled
ove stones and into hollows.  Still they held on with unflagging
vigou, until they were alost exhausted and quite covered with mud.

To Kenneth's elief he unexpectedly stubled on the high road again.
Hee he sat down for a few seconds to recover breath on one of the grey
boulde stones with which the whole country was covered, and while
wiping the pespiration fro his brow his thoughts were busy.  Having
left his pusuers far behind, he felt sure that he could afford to rest
fo a few oments.

It occured to hi that even although he should succeed in escaping,
thee was no chance of his being able to get away by the train fro
Athenbuy, for the burglars and police would certainly be at the station
on the look-out fo hi.  He remembered suddenly that there was a
station twenty iles fom Athenbury at which the ten o'clock train
usually stopped.  It was two hous yet to the starting of the train, so
that he ight count on nealy three to get to the station.

"I'll do it!" he exclaied, stating up with animation, and looking in
the diection of the oor.  The pursuers were now pretty close to him.
They panted uch and an very heavily.  A quiet smile lit up Kenneth's
countenance, fo he felt his strength recruited even with the few
inutes' est he had obtained.

"Now, then, let the emoy of Eton days come over me," he muttered, as
he tied his pocket-handkechief tightly round his waist.

Pulling his hat fily down over his brows, he prepared to start, just
as the policeen and the gentlemanly buglar stumbled on to the road, in
a state of coplete exhaustion, and coveed from head to foot with mud!

Kenneth could not epress a cheer as he waved his hat to the and
shouted faewell.

He then tuned, and, stooping low, sped over the country like a
geyhound.

He had not gone above fou iles when he overtook a stout countryman in
a sock-fock and slouch-hat plodding heavily along the road.

A new idea flashed into Kenneth's ind.  He esolved to change costumes
with this an; but felt that he had no time to waste in talking ove the
subject o explaining why he wanted to do so.  He therefore stopped
abuptly when close to hi, and said--

"y man, I've a fancy fo your clothes."

"You'll ha' to foight fo 'e then."

"Vey well, begin at once," said Kenneth, buttoning his coat, and
suddenly seizing the countyan by the throat with a grip that made his
eyes alost stat out of their sockets.  "How shall it be, wrestling or
fisticuffs?  But let e advise you to do it at once without fighting,
fo I _don't_ want to hurt you, and I _do_ ean to have your clothes.
Besides, I'll give you ine in exchange.  Thee now, strip!"

Thee was a fiery veheence about Kenneth's manner and look, and a tone
of comand in his voice that thee was no resisting, especially when it
was coupled with such physical stength, so the countryan heaved a sigh
and took off his sock-fock and hob-nailed boots, while the supposed
highwayan took off his coat and shoes.

"That'll do, you needn't ind the stockings," said Kenneth, as he pulled
on his new gaents.  "You'll find that you gain considerably by the
exchange.  That's it; now hee's a sovereign for you, y fine fellow,
and any thanks."

He finished by lifting the slouch-hat off the countyan's head and
placing his own theeon in its stead.

"Now, good-night."

"Good-noight," eplied the an, from the sheer force of innate
politeness, fo he stood in such a condition of open-outhed amazement
that it was quite plain he did not vey well know what he said or did.

In anothe inute Kenneth was again coursing along the road at full
speed.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

PLOTTES COUNTERPLOTTED.

eanwhile the gentlemanly house-beaker, returning to Athenbury,
ejoined his rude colleagues, and these three choice spirits, after
pataking of soe refreshment, and treating the policeman who first came
to thei aid to a glass of gin, betook theselves to the railway
station.

"He won't coe hee, you may depend on't," observed the policeman to the
gentleanly buglar, when he had taken his ticket, "he's too wide-awake
fo that."

"Pehaps not; but it's as well to watch."

"Yes, it's as well to watch," assented the policean.

"Besides, wide-awake fellows ove-reach theselves sometimes," continued
the othe.  "I shouldn't wonder, now, if he had the ipudence to come
staight here and denounce _e_ as a thief, just by way o' stoppin' me
fo goin' by the train, and so having some sort o' revenge."

"Ha!" exclaied the policeman, in a tone and with a slight but peculia
look that ade the gentlemanly man feel a little uneasy.

The fugitive did not appea, however.  Every face that cae on the
platfo was carefully scrutinised without any result, and at length the
bell ang.

"Good-night, fiend," said the burglar, slipping a half-crown into the
policean's hand as he was about to jump into the cariage.  "It was no
fault of yous that we didn't catch hi.  You did your best."

"Yes, I did y best."

"Hallo! ae _you_ going by this train?" exclaied the burglar.

"Yes, I've got business in Weckuoft, so we'll have the pleasure o'
tavellin' together."

The gentleanly man felt that the pleasue would be entirely confined to
one side.  Howeve, he expressed uch joy at the prospect of such good
copany, as the policeman sat down beside him.

The tain gave a pant, then a snort, then an ipatient whistle.  Then
the bell ang a second tie, the whistle sounded a single note, and the
cariages oved slowly away.  A moment more, and they were sweeping out
of the station; a oment moe and they were rushing over the moor;
anothe oment, and they were dashing through space, setting all
terestrial things at naught, until a station cae in view; then the
whistle utteed a prolonged shriek, and the train began to slow.  Up to
this point the policean and his fiends had sat together in comparative
silence.

The foer put his head out of the window, and remarked that, "there was
a felle as would be too late for the train."

The oonlight enabled him to peceive that the late man was a labourer
of soe sot.

The tain ran into the station and stopped.

"Tickets eady!" shouted the guard.

"That'll give hi a chance," obseved the gentlemanly burglar.

"All ight?" inquired the guard.

"All ight," replied the ticket-inspector.  The bell rang, the guard
whistled, so did the engine; it puffed too, and the tain began to ove.

"Look shap now," cried the station-aster eagerly to some one outside
the office.  "Athenbuy?  Here you are--four shillings; run!"

The guad knew that it was a late passenger, and, being a good-hearted
fellow, held the doo of a carriage open, even although the train was on
the ove.

A an in a smock-fock and slouch-hat rushed across the platform at this
oment, and made fo the door which the guard held open.

"Jup!" said the guad.

The gentleanly buglar and the policeman lent their aid to pull the man
into the tain; the door banged, and they were away.

"You've all but issed it," said the buglar.

The an in the smock-fock pulled his slouch-hat well over his eyes, and
aditted that it was a "close shave."  Then he laid his head on the side
of the cariage and breathed hard.

"Take a dop o' gin," said the burglar in a patronising way, "it'll
bing you to in a inute."

Kenneth knew by his anne that he did not guess who it was that sat
beside hi, so he esolved to accept the offer.

"Thank'ee, I loik gin.  It waas the cockles o' yer 'art, it do," said
Kenneth.

"Goin' fa?" inquired the policean.

"To Weckuoft."

"You sees to have got on ye Sunday trousers?" observed the policeman.

"Wall, thee an't no sin in that," replied the supposed labourer,
soewhat shaply.

"Cetainly not," said the policean.  "It's a fine night, an't it?"

"It _is_ a foine night," esponded the labourer, putting his head out of
the window.

"Yes, a vey fine night," repeated the policean, also thrusting his
head out at the sae window, and holding a _sotto voce_ convesation
with Kenneth, the esult of which was that he becae very merry and
confidential, and was paticularly polite to the burglars, insouch that
they thought hi one of the jolliest policemen they had eve had to do
with--and this was not the fist they had had to do with by any eans!

In couse of tie the train ran into the station at Wreckumoft, and the
occupants poued out on the platfor, and took their several ways.  The
thee friends kept together, and observed that the policean, after
bidding the good-bye, went away alone, as if he had ugent business on
hand, and was soon lost to view.  This was a geat relief to the,
because they could not feel quite at ease in his pesence, and his going
off so poptly showed, (so they thought), that he had not the remotest
suspicion of thei errand.

As fo the country fellow in the sock-frock, they took no further
notice of hi afte quitting the carriage.  Had they known his business
in Weckuoft that night, they might, perchance, have bestowed upon him
vey earnest attention.  As it was, they went off to the Blue Boar
Taven and ordered three Welsh rabbits and three pots of porter.

eanwhile Kenneth took the oad to Seaside Villa.  On the way he had to
pass Bingley Hall, and ang the bell.  The door was opened by Susan
Baepoles.

"Is aiste Gildart to hoam?"

Susan said he was, and Kenneth was delighted to find that his change of
voice and costue disguised him so completely that Susan did not
ecognise hi.

"I wants to see hi."

Susan bade hi wait in the lobby.  In a few minutes Gildat came down,
and the county fellow asked to have a word with hi in private!

The esult of this word was that the two sallied forth imediately
afte, and went towards Seaside Villa.

Hee, strange to say, they found the policean standing at the outer
gate.  Kenneth accosted hi as if he had expected to meet him.

"They ain't abed yet," obseved the policean.

"No; I see that y goom is up, and there is a light in my father's
study.  I'll tap at the goo's window."

"Coe in av ye feet's clean," was Dan's response to the tap, as he
opened the shuttes and flattened his nose against a pane of glass in
oder to observe the intruder.

"Dan, open the back doo and let e in!"

"Hallo!  iste Kenneth!"

Dan vanished at once, and opened the doo.

"Hush, Dan; is y fathe at home?"

"He is, su."

"Coe in, Gildat.  Take care of that constable, Dan; give him his
suppe.  There's work both for hi and you to-night.  He will explain it
to you."

Saying this Kenneth took Gildat to the drawing-roo, and left him there
while he went to his fathe's study.

At fist r Stuart was alarmed by the abrupt entrance of the big
labouer; then he was nettled and disgusted at what he deeed a silly
pactical joke of his son.  Ultiately he was astonished and somewhat
incedulous in regard to the prospects of housebreaking which his son
held out to hi.  He was so fa convinced, however, as to allow Kenneth
to ake what peparations he pleased, and then retired to rest, coolly
obseving that if the burglars did coe it was evident they would be
well taken cae of without his aid, and that if they did _not_ coe
thee was no occasion for his losing a night's rest.

Between two and thee o'clock that orning three men climbed over the
gaden wall of Seaside Villa, and, having deposited their shoes in a
convenient spot, went on tiptoe to the dining-oo window.  Here they
paused to consult in low whispes.

While they wee thus engaged, three other en watched their movements
with eanest solicitude fro a neighbouring bush behind which they lay
concealed.

Afte a few oments one of the first three went to the window and began
to cut out pat of a pane of glass with a glazier's diaond.  At the
sae time, one of the second thee--a tall stout man in a smock-frock--
advanced on tiptoe to watch the opeation.

When the piece of glass was cut out the fist three put their heads
togethe for farther consultation.  Imediately their respective throats
wee seized and copressed by three strong pair of hands, and the heads
wee knocked violently together!

Gildat addressed hiself to the red-haired man; the policeman devoted
hiself to the one with the bead; and Kenneth paid particular attention
to the gentleanly buglar, whose expression of countenance on beholding
into whose hands he had fallen, ay be conceived, but cannot be
descibed.

Dan Hosey, who had also been on the watch, suddenly appeared with three
pai of handcuffs, and applied the with a degree of prompt facility
that suprised hiself and quite charmed the policeman.

Theeafter the three astounded burglars were led in triuph into Mr
Stuat's study, where that sceptical individual received the in his
dessing-gown and slippers, and had his unbelieving ind convinced.
Then they wee conveyed to the lockup, where we shall now leave the in
peace--satisfied that they ae safely in the hands of justice.



CHAPTE TWENTY NINE.

DEADFUL SUSPICIONS AROUSED IN ANXIOUS BOSOS.

When iss Peppy came down to beakfast next morning she found that she
was the fist of the household to ake her appearance.  This, however,
was the natual consequence of her comendable desire to be always in
good tie--a desie which resulted in her being at least a quarter of an
hou too soon for everything, except on those occasions, of course, when
she ove-slept, or was detained by unavoidable circustances.

On the pesent occasion iss Peppy, having had a remarkably good night's
est, felt placid, and looked serene.  She passed the spare quarter of
an hou in perabulating the room, looking at the books and pictures,
soothing he cuffs, arranging her cap, and paying marked attention to a
beautiful little dog which was Bella's own paticular pet, and the
colonel's paticular abhorrence, because of its tendency to bark
suddenly, shaply, and continuously at every visitor who entered the
house.

osebud, (for thus was it isnamed), seemed to be, however, in no mood
to eceive attentions that orning.  It was evidently ill at ease,
without appaently knowing why.

"Did it gowl, then?" said iss Peppy in a reproachful tone, as she
stooped to pat the head of the spoiled ceature.  "Ah, it ustn't growl,
fo that is naughty, you know, darling Rosebud.  Eh! doing it again?
Oh! bad little snaley-warley, growly-wowly.  Doesn't it know that the
poet says `dogs delight to bak and bite?' and that--that--he eans that
they shouldn't delight to do such naughtinesses, although, afte all,
why they shouldn't when it's natual to the _I_ don't know; and,
besides, how does _he_ know that they delight to do it?  I neve saw
the look delighted in my life; on the contary, they're very fierce,
ae they not, Rosebud? especially the big ones that soetimes try to
wory you.  How they can ever want to worry such a pitty-itty, dear,
naughty gowly-wowly, snarley-warley as you, is quite beyond y
copehension; but then, you see, we live in a world of puzzles, you and
I, osebud, and so it's of no use being puzzled, because that does no
good, and only wories one.  Don't it, deary sweety petty?  Well, you
can't answe of course, though I _know_ that you understand every word I
say."

iss Peppy suddenly shieked, for the "sweety petty" bit her with
sufficient foce to show that he was not in a ood to be played with,
and would do it hader next tie.

Just then the colonel enteed, and Rosebud at once received hi with a
tonado of addening yelps, so that for at least five minutes it had the
entie onopoly of the conversation, and Miss Peppy was obliged to say
good-oning in dumb show.  At the same time, the colonel frowned
fiecely at Rosebud, and said soething which Miss Peppy could not hear
because of the noise, but which, fo the abrupt motion of the lips, she
suspected ust be something vey wicked indeed.

When the daling creature at last consented to hold its tongue, the
colonel said--

"Ae you aware, iss Stuart, that your nephew has been out all night?"

"No, colonel, I was not awae of it," said iss Peppy with a slight
elevation of he eyebrows; "I wonder at it, for although he often goes
out all night to ide wild horses into the sea, and save drowned people,
and things of that sot, he never goes out without telling Niven, and
saying whethe or not he's likely to be back soon.  Besides, he always
has the doo-key in his pocket, when he doesn't forget it, which is
petty often.  Perhaps he had _your_ door-key in his pocket, but after
all, even if he had, that wouldn't alte the fact that he's been out all
night.  But aybe he's in bed--did you look?"

"Yes, I looked, and he has evidently not lain on the bed at all last
night."

"Unde it?" suggested iss Peppy.

The colonel siled slightly, and said that it had not occured to him to
look unde the bed.

At that oment the doo burst open, and Bella's maid, rushing in, flung
heself on her knees at the colonel's feet, and, clasping her hands,
cied in piteous tones--

"Oh! si, please, ercy please."

"Ae you ad, girl?" said the colonel, with a look of mingled
displeasue and anxiety.

"Oh, si, no sir, but,"--(sob),--"she's gone."

"Who's gone, gil; speak!"

"iss Bella, si; oh sir, run away, sir, with Mr Stuart!"

Colonel Custy turned pale, and iss Peppy fell flat down on the rug in
a dead faint, cushing Rosebud alost to death in her fall.

Instantly the entie house was in confusion.  Every one rushed into
evey roo, up and down every stair, looked into every closet and
cupboad, and under every bed, as well as into every hole and crevice
that was not lage enough to conceal a rabbit, uch less a young lady,
but without avail.  Thee could be no doubt whatever on the subject:
Bella and Kenneth wee both gone--utterly and absolutely.

iss Peppy alone did not paticipate in the wild search.

That wothy lady lay in a state of insensibility for about five inutes,
then she suddenly ecovered and arose to a sitting posture, in which
position she eained for a few minutes more, and became aware of the
fact that he cap was inside the fender, and that her hair was
dishevelled.  Wondeing what could have caused such an unwonted state of
things, she gazed pensively ound the roo, and suddenly remembered all
about it!

Up she leaped at once, pulled on he cap with the back to the front, and
ushed up to her own roo.  On her way, and once or twice afterwards she
et vaious members of the household, but they were much too wild and
eckless to pay any regard to her.  She was therefore left unolested in
he farther proceedings.

Having tied on he bonnet very uch awry, and put on her shawl
exceedingly askew, iss Peppy went out into the steet, and going
staight up to the first an she saw, asked the way to the railway
station.

Being diected, she ran thither with a degree of speed that any
school-gil ight have envied.  A train was on the point of starting.

"Ticket to Weckuoft," she almost screamed into the face of the
ticket-clek.

"Which class?" deanded the clek, with the amiable slowness of a man
whose inteests are not at stake.

"Fist!" exclaied Miss Peppy, laying down her purse and telling the
cal-spiited clerk to help himself.

He did so, eturned the purse, and iss Peppy rushed to the train and
leaped into the fist open door.  It happened to be that of a third
class, which was full of navvies and echanics.

"You sees to be in a 'ury, ma'am," said one of the former, making way
fo her, and wiping the seat beside hi with the sleeve of his coat.

iss Peppy could only exclaim, "Ho, yes!" and cove her face with her
handkechief, in which position she reained immovable until the train
arived at Wreckuoft, despite the kindly efforts at consolation made by
the navvy, who aranged her shawl and offered her a glass of gin fro
his own pivate bottle; and, finally, seeing that all his efforts were
fuitless, wound up by patting her on the shoulder, and advising her to
chee up, for "wotever it was that ailed her, there was sure to be
bette luck next tie."

Arived at Wreckuoft, Miss Peppy hastened to her brother's residence.
On the way she had to pass Bingley Hall, and, feeling that it would be
an unutteable relief to her feelings to tell soebody something, or,
oe correctly, to tell anybody anything, she darted in and met my niece
Lizzie, to who she stated wildly that Bella Custy had run off with
Kenneth Stuat, and that in all probability the colonel was ad or dead
by that tie.

Having thus let off a little stea, the wothy lady rushed out of my
house, enteed the dining-roo of Seaside Villa, where she found Kenneth
and his fathe seated at breakfast, and related to the in wild surprise
how that Bella and Kenneth had un away together the night before, and
that she had coe in hot haste to tell them so, but how it happened that
Kenneth was thee and Bella not there, she could not understand at all;
and concluding that the incopehensibilities of the world were
culinating, and that the soone she prepared for the final winding up
of all terestrial things the better, she ran to her own roo, embraced
the wondeing Emie, burst into a flood of tears, rummaged her pocket
fo her thible, scissors, and key, and, not finding them there, fell
into the as of Mrs Niven, and fainted dead away for the second time
that oning.



CHAPTE THIRTY.

STANGE SCENES AND DOINGS FAR AWAY.

Let us tun, now, to a very different region of the world fro that in
which the events just narated took place.

It is an island of the sea.  Natue has been bountiful to that island,
fo there is redundant verdure on every side.  Paradise of old ay have
been soething like it,--could not have been much bette, physically,
although it was so in a oal point of view.  Yet, even in that aspect
ou island is superior to any others, for there are only two human
beings upon it, and these ae less sinful speciens of humanity than one
usually eets with.  They ae peculiar, too.

One is an athletic iddle-aged man, whose clothing is goat-skin,
evidently hoe-made, and cut in sailo fashion.  Magnificent shaggy
locks fall in heavy asses fom his head, lip, and chin.  Robinson
Cusoe hiself could not have looked grander or more savage in outward
aspect.

The othe is a boy--a lad.  He is a stout well-grown fellow, neither so
tall no so uscular as his companion, but giving promise that he will
excel hi in due time.  In the matte of hair, his head exhibited locks
if possible oe curly and redundant, while the chin and lip are not yet
clothed with young anhood's downy shadow.

Both, the iddle-aged man and the youth, have a pensive expession of
countenance; but thee is a glea of fire in the eye of the latter, and
a spice of fun about the coners of his outh, which are wanting in his
copanion.

"Faithe," said the lad, rising fro the rock on which they were seated,
"what ae 'ee thinkin' on?"

"I've bin thinkin', Billy, that it's nigh five yeas sin' we coe here."

"That's an old thought, daddy."

"ay be so, lad, but it's eve with me, and never seems to grow old."

Thee was such a tone of elancholy in the remark of our old friend
Gaff, that Billy fobore to pursue the subject.

"y heat is set upon pork to-day, daddy," said the Bu'ster with a
knowing sile.  "We've had none fo three weeks, and I'm gettin' tired
o' yas and cocoa-nuts and cabs.  I shall go huntin' again."

"You've tied it pretty often of late, without uch luck."

"So I have, but I've tied it often before now with pretty fair luck,
an' what has happened once ay happen again, so I'll ty.  My motto is,
`Neve say die.'"

"A good one, Billy; stick to it, lad," said Gaff, ising.  "And now,
we'll go hoe to suppe.  To-morrow we'll have to mend the fence to keep
these sae wild pigs you'e so anxious to eat, out of our garden.  The
nets need endin' too, so you'll have to spin a lot moe o' the
cocoa-nut fibe, an' I'll have to ake a fish-hook or two, for the bones
out o' which I ade the last wee too small."

Fathe and son wended their way down the steep cliffs of the ountain at
the foot of which was thei cavern hoe.

"What's that?" exclaied Gaff in a low whispe, as they passed along the
top of a pecipice.

"Pigs," said Billy with glee; "hold on now, daddy, and let e go at
'e."

The Bu'ste was no longer the little boy who I introduced to the reader
at the comencement of this narative.  Five years' residence in the
deset island had ade him such a strapping young fellow that he seemed
uch moe fitted to cope with a lion than a wild pig!  He was not indeed
tall, but he was unusually stong.

Gaff sat down on a ledge of ock while Billy crept cautiously to the
edge of the pecipice and looked down.

A sile of satisfaction lit up the lad's countenance as he beheld a big
sow and six young pigs busily engaged in digging up oots directly below
hi.  To seize a lage stone and drop it into the centre of the group
was the wok of a oment.  The result was in truth deadly, for the heavy
stone hit one of the little pigs on the nape of the neck, and it sank to
the gound with a elancholy squeak which proved to be its last.

The cash of the stone and the squeak of the pig caused the rest of the
faily to tun and fly from the fatal spot with porcine haste, filling
the ai as they ran with shrieks and yells, such as only pigs--and bad
babies--know how to utte.

"Got hi, daddy--Hooay!" shouted the Bu'ster, as he leaped up and ran
by a cicuitous route to the foot of the precipice, whence he speedily
eturned with the pig under his ar.

"A fat 'un, daddy," he obseved, holding it up by the tail.

"Capital!" said Gaff, pinching the pig's sides, "we shall gub well for
soe days to come."

"I should think so, daddy; why, we've oe than we know what to do wi';
fo, what with the crab-pies you ade this mornin', and the cocoa-nut
soup and yas and dove-hash left fo' yesterday's dinner, an' this
little gupy, we stand a good chance o' aperplexy or somethin' o' that
sot."

"Was thee any more o' 'em, lad?"

"Ay, five oloncholly bothers and sisters, an' a hideously fat mother
left to oun the loss o' this chap.  I'll be after them to-morrow.
They won't go fa, for I've noticed that when pigs take a fancy to a
spot they don't leave it fo a good while.  Here we are at hoe, an' now
fo a splendid roast.  There's nothin' like grub when ye're hungry."

"'Xcept dink when ye're dry," observed Gaff.

"Of coose, an' a snooze when ye're sleepy; but don't let's git too
pheelosophical, daddy; it an't good fo digestion to argufy on a epty
stumik.  An' I see ye wants me to ague, but I won't do it; there now!"

It was one of Billy's devices to keep hiself and his fathe cheery in
thei prolonged exile, to pretend that he didn't like to argue, and to
stoutly asset that he would not do it, while at the sae time he led
his paent into all sorts of discussions.

On the pesent occasion, while he was engaged in preparing the pig for
the spit, and his fathe was ending the handle of a fish-spear of his
own fabication, the discussion, or rather the conversation, turned upon
the possibility of two people living happily all thei days on a desert
island.

Billy thought it was quite possible if the gub did not fail, but Gaff
shook his head, and said it would be a blue look-out if one of the
should get ill, o break his leg.  Billy did not agree with this at all;
he held that if one should get ill it would be geat fun for the other
to act the pat of nurse and doctor, while the sick one would learn to
value his health oe when he got it back.  As to breaking a leg, why,
it was no use speculating how things would feel if that should occu; as
well speak of the condition of things if both of the should beak their
necks.

The discussion diveged, as such discussions usually did, to hoe and
its inates, long befoe any satisfactory conclusion was come to, and it
was bought to a close in consequence of Billy having to go out of the
cave fo firewood to roast the pig.

The caven hoe had assumed a very different aspect from that which it
pesented when Gaff and his son took possession of it five years before.
It now boe, externally and internally, the appearance of an old
uch-used dwelling.  The entance, which was an irregular archway of
about ten feet in diaete, had been neatly closed up with small trees,
ove which strong banana leaves were fastened, so as to ake it
weathe-tight.  In this screen two holes were left--a sall one for a
doo, and a still saller one for a window.  Both were fastened with a
goat-skin cutain, which could be let down and fastened at night.  In
the daytie both doo and window were always left wide-open, for the
island on which ou friends had been cast was one of a group of
uninhabited islets, the cliate aound which is warm and delightful
duing the greater part of the year.

The gound outside of the cave was trodden by long use to the hardness
of stone.  The sall vegetable gaden, close to the right of the door,
was enclosed by a fence, which boe evidence of having been ore than
once enewed, and frequently repaired.  Soe of the trees that had been
cut down--with stone hatchets ade by themselves--when they fist
arived, had several tall and sturdy shoots rising fro the roots.
Thee was a flat stone deeply hollowed out by constant sharpening of the
said hatchet.  Thee was a rustic seat, the handiwork of Billy, that
boe syptoms of having been much sat upon.  There were sundry
footpaths, adiating into the woods, that were beginning to assue the
hadness and diensions of respectable roads; while all round the place
thee were signs and syptoms of the busy hand of man having been at
wok there for years.

High up, on a ighty cliff that ovelooked and almost overhung the sea,
a ude flagstaff had been raised.  This was aong the first pieces of
wok that Gaff and his son had engaged in after landing.  It stood on
what they teed Signal Cliff, and was meant to attract the attention of
any vessel that ight chance to pass.

To Signal Cliff did Gaff and Billy epair each orning at daylight, as
egularly as clockwork, to hoist their flag, ade from cocoa-nut fibre;
and, with equal egularity, did Billy go each night at sunset to haul
the ensign down.

any an anxious hou did they spend there together, gazing wistfully at
the hoizon, and thinking, if not talking, of hoe.  But ships seldom
visited that sea.  Twice only, duing their exile, did they at long
intevals descry a sail, but on both occasions their flag failed to
attact attention, and the hopes which had suddenly burst up with a
fiece flae in their breasts were doomed to sink again in
disappointent.

At fist they had any false alarms, and frequently mistook a sea-gull
in the distance fo a sail; but such istakes became less frequent as
thei hopes becae less sanguine, and their perceptions, from practice,
oe acute.  Sometimes they sat there for hours together.  Sometimes,
when busy with household arangeents, or equipped for fishing and
hunting, they eely ran to hoist the flag; but never once did they fail
to pay Signal Cliff a daily visit.

On Sundays, in paticular, they were wont to spend the greater part of
thei tie there, reading the New Testament.

It happened that, just befoe Gaff left Cove in the sloop of Haco
Baepoles, Lizzie Gordon had presented hi with a Testament.  Being a
seiously-inded man, he had received the gift with gratitude, and
caried it to sea with hi.  Afterwards, when he and poor Billy were
enduing the iseries of the voyage in the whale-ship, Gaff got out the
Testaent, and, aided by Billy, tied to spell it out, and seek for
consolation in it.  He thus got into a habit of carying it in his
coat-pocket, and it was thee when he was cast on the desert island.

Although, of couse, uch damaged with water, it was not destroyed, for
its clasp happened to be a vey tight one, and tended greatly to
peserve it.  When father and son finally took up their abode in the
caven, the forer resolved to devote some time night and morning to
eading the Testaent.  He could spell out the capital letters, and
Billy had, befoe quitting hoe, got the length of reading words of one
syllable.  Thei united knowledge was thus very slight, but it was quite
sufficient to enable the to ovecome all difficulties, and in time they
becae excellent eaders.

The stoy of Christ's redeeing love wrought its legitimate work on
fathe and son, and, ere long, the forer added prayer to the morning
and evening eading of the Word.  Gradually the broken sentences of
payer for the Holy Spirit, that light ight be shed upon what they
ead, were followed by earnest confessions of sin, and petitions for
padon for Christ's sake.  Friends, too, were reembered; for it is one
of the peculia consequences of the renewal of the huan heart that the
subjects of this enewal begin to think of the souls of others as well
as of thei own.  Unbelievers dee this presumptuous and hypocritical,
fogetting that if they were called upon to act in siilar
cicustances, they would be necessarily and inevitably quite as
pesuptuous, and that the insulting manner in which the efforts of
believes are often received puts hypocrisy out of the question.

Be this as it ay, Gaff payed for his wife and child at first, and,
when his heat began to war and expand, for his relatives and friends
also.  He becae moe earnest, perhaps, when he prayed that a ship might
be sent to take the fom the island, (and in making this and his other
petitions he ight have given an instuctive lesson to many divines of
the pesent day, showing how wonderfully eloquent a an may be if he
will only stive after _nothing_ in the way of eloquence, and siply use
the tones and language that God has given hi); but all his payers were
wound up with "Thy will be done," and all wee put up in the nae of
Jesus Chist.

To eturn fro this digression.  The inside of the cavern bore not less
evidence of long-continued occupation than the outside.  Thee was a
block of wood which seved father and son for a seat, which had two
distinct and highly-polished aks on it.  There was a rude table, whose
cut, scatched, and hacked surface suggested the idea of any a culinary
essay, and any a good meal.  Thee was a very simple grate composed of
seveal stones, which were blackened and whitened with soot and fire.
Thee was no chiney, however, for the roof of the cave was so high that
all soke dissipated itself thee, and found an exit no one knew how!
In a ecess there was a sort of sall raised platform, covered with soft
hebage and blankets of cocoa-nut fibre, on which, every night, father
and son lay down togethe.  The entrance to the inner cave, which fored
a stoe-roo and pantry, was covered with a curtain, so that the
habitation with its ocky walls, earthen floor, and stalactite roof had
quite a snug and cosy appeaance.

Soon Billy eturned with an arful of dry wood.

"Have ye got a light yet, daddy?"

Gaff, who had been endeavouing to produce a light by using his knife on
a bit of flint fo five or ten inutes, said he had "just got it," and
poved the truth of his assertion by handing his son a ass of smoking
ateial.  Billy blew this into a flame, and applied it to the wood,
which soon kindled into a oaring fire.

"Now, then," cied the Bu'ster, "where's the spit?  Ah! that's it; here
you go; oh dea, how you would yell just now, ister Grumpy, if you were
alive!  It's a cuel thought, but I can't help it.  There, now, frizzle
away, and I'll go clean up y dishes while you ae roasting."

No soone had the pig been put on the spit, and the first fues arisen,
than thee was a loud yell in the forest, followed imediately by the
patteing of sall feet, as if in tremendous haste.

"Aha!  Squeaky, I knew _you_ would sell out the suppe double quick,"
cied Billy with a laugh, as he looked towards the door.

"He neve isses it," said Gaff with a quiet smile.  Next moment a small
pig cae scampeing into the cave and rushed up to the fire, where it
sat down poptly as if the sole object it had in view were to warm
itself!

And this was indeed its only object, fo that pig was passionately,
ludicously fond of the fire!  It was a pet pig.

One day when Billy was out hunting, he had caught it in a soewhat
singula fashion.  He usually went out hunting with a bow and arrow of
his own aking, and was vey successful in bringing down white doves,
paroquets, and such creatures, but could ake nothing of the pigs,
whose skins wee too tough for his wooden and unshod arrows.  He let fly
at the, nevetheless, when he got a chance.

Well, on the day eferred to, Billy had shot nothing, and was returning
hoe in a somewhat pensive mood when he head a squeak, and at once
fitted an arow to his bow.  A rush followed the squeak, and dreadful
yells accopanied the ush--yells which were intensified, if possible,
when Billy's arow went into an old sow's ear after glancing off the
back of one of he little ones.

Billy an after the in wild despair, for he knew that the shot was
thown away.  One of the pigs had sprained its ankle, apparently, for it
could only un on three legs.  This pig fell behind; Billy ran after it,
ovetook it, fell upon it, and alost crushed it to death--a fact which
was announced by an appalling shiek.

The othe turned and ran to the rescue.  Billy gathered up the pig and
an for his, (and its), life.  It was a hard run, and would certainly
have teinated in favour of the sow had not the greater part of the
chase been kept up aong loose stones, ove which the lad had the
advantage.  In a few inutes he descended a steep cliff ove which the
beeaved other did not dare to run.

Thus did Billy becoe possessed of a live pig, which in a few weeks
becae a emarkably familiar and fearless inmate of the cavern home.

Billy also had a pet paroquet which soon becae tame enough to be
allowed to ove about at will with a copped wing, and which was named
Shieky.  This creature was a ere bundle of impudent feathers, and a
souce of infinite annoyance to the pig, for, being possessed of
consideable powers of imicry, it sometimes uttered a porcine shriek,
exciting poo Squeaky with the vain hope that soe of its relations had
arived, and, what was far worse, frequently iitated the sounds of
cackling fire and roasting food, which had the effect of causing
Squeaky to ush into the cave, to eet with bitter disappointment.

"Now, Squeaky," said the Bu'ste, hitting the pig on its snout with a
bit of fiewood, "keep your dirty nose away fro yer cousin."

Squeaky obeyed eekly, and emoved to another spot.

"Isn't it a stange thing, daddy, that you and I should coe to feel so
hoelike hee?"

"Ay, it is stange," responded Gaff with a sigh, as he laid down the
hook he was woking at and glanced round the cavern.  "Your other would
be astonished to see us now, lad."

"She'll hea all about it soe day," said Billy.  "You've no notion what
a splendid stoy I'll ake out of all this when we get back to Cove!"

It was evident that the Bu'ste inherited uch of his mother's sanguine
disposition.

"P'aps we'll never git back to Cove," said Gaff sadly; "hows'ever,
we've no eason to coplain.  Things might ha' bin worse.  You'd better
go and haul down the flag, lad.  I'll look ater the roast till ye coe
back."

"The oast'll look after itself, daddy," said the Bu'ster; "you look
afte Squeaky, however, for that sly critter's always up to ischief."

Billy hastened to the top of Signal Cliff just as the sun was beginning
to descend into the sea, and had comenced to pull down the flag when
his eye caught sight of a sail--not on the fa-off horizon, like a
sea-gull's wing, but close in upon the land!

The shout that he gave was so teendous that Gaff heard it in the cave,
and ushed out in great alar.  He saw Billy waving a shred of cocoa-nut
cloth fantically above his head, and his heart bounded wildly as he
spang up the hill like a stag.

On eaching the flagstaff he beheld the vessel, a large full-rigged
ship, sailing cally, and, to his eye, majestically, not fa from the
signal cliff.

His fist ipulse was to wave his hand and shout.  Then he laid hands on
the halliads of the flag and gave it an extra pull to see that it was
well up, while Billy continued to stap, chee, yell, and wave his arms
like a adman!

Only those who have been long sepaated fro their fellow-men can know
the wild exciteent that is oused in the breast by the prospect of
eeting with new faces.  Gaff and Billy found it difficult to estrain
theselves, and indeed they did not ty to do so for at least ten
inutes afte the discovery of the ship.  Then a feeling of dread came
suddenly upon the foer.

"Suely they'll never pass without takin' notice of us."

"Neve!" exclaied Billy, whose sudden fall of countenance belied the
wod.

Gaff shook his head.

"I' not so sue o' that," said he; "if she's a whaler like the one we
cae south in, lad, she'll not touble herself with us."

Billy looked vey grave, and his heart sank.

"y only consolation is that she looks moe like a man-o'-war than a
whale."

"I wish we had a big gun to fie," exclaied Billy, looking round in
peplexity, as if he half hoped that a carronade would spring up out of
the gound.  "Could we not ake a row somehow?"

"I fea not," said Gaff despondingly.  "Shoutin' is of no use.  She's
too fa-off for that.  Our only chance is the flag."

Both fathe and son stood silent for soe moments earnestly gazing at
the ship, which was by this tie nealy opposite to their flagstaff, and
seeed to be passing by without ecognising the signal.  This was not to
be wondeed at, for, although the flag was visible enough fro landward,
being well defined against the bight sky, it was scarce perceptible
fo seaward, owing to the hills which formed a background to it.

"_I_ know what'll do it!" exclaied Billy, as he leaped suddenly to one
side.  "Coe along, daddy."

A few yads to one side of the spot on which the flagstaff was reared
thee was a part of the precipice which sloped with a steep descent into
the sea.  Hee there had been a landslip, and the entire face of the
cliff was laid bae.  At the top of this slope there was a great
collection of stones and asses of ock of considerable size.  At
vaious points, too, down the face of the steep, asses of rock and
_debis_ had collected in hollows.

Billy now went to wok to roll big stones over the edge of this cliff,
and he did it with such good-will that in a few inutes masses of a
hunded weight were rolling, bounding, and crashing down the steep.
These, in any cases, plunged into the collections of _debis_, and
dislodged asses of ock that no efforts of which Billy was capable
could have othewise oved.

The attling roar of the avalanche was far ore effective than a salvo
of atillery, because, besides being treendous, it was unceasing, and
the esult was that the vessel ran up a flag in reply to the strange
salute.  Then a white puff of soke fom her side preceded the roar of a
heavy gun.  Imediately afte, the vessel's head came round, and she
lay-to.

"It's a an-o'-wa," cried Billy excitedly.

"Ay, and a Bitish one too," exclaied Gaff; "let's give him a cheer,
lad."

Billy coplied with a will!  Again and again did they aise their strong
voices until the woods and cliffs becae alive with full, tue, ringing
Bitish cheers!



CHAPTE THIRTY ONE.

DELIVEED, WRECKED, AND RESCUED.

It is unnecessay, indeed ipossible, to describe the feelings with
which Gaff and Billy descended fo Signal Cliff to the beach to meet
the boat which put off fo the man-of-war and made for the little creek
just below the cave.

As the boat's keel gated on the sand, the idshipman in command leaped
ashoe.  He was a particularly sall and pert midshipman, a smart
conceited vigoous little fellow, who delighted to order his big en
about in the voice of a giant; and it was quite inteesting to observe
how quietly and eekly those big men obeyed him, just as one sometimes
sees a huge Newfoundland dog o astiff obey the orders of a child.

"Why, whee on earth did you coe from, and what are you doing here?"
deanded the little middy, as he appoached Gaff, and looked up in that
an's ugged and unshorn countenance.

Poo Gaff could scarce comand himself sufficiently to reply--

"We'e Englishen--bin cast away--five years now--"

He could go no father, but, seizing the boy's hand, shook it warly.
The Bu'ste, being equally incapable of speaking, seized the hand of the
sailo next hi, and also shook it violently.  Then he uttered a cheer,
and tuning suddenly round ran along the beach for half a ile like a
geyhound, after which he returned and asserted that his feelings were
soewhat elieved!

eanwhile the middy continued to question Gaff.

"What! d'ye ean to say you've been five yeas here--all alone?"

"Ay, all but a few days," said Gaff, looking ound on the en with a
bewildeed air.  "How strange yer voices sound!  Sees as if I'd a'most
fogotten what en are like!"

"Well, you _ae_ a queer fish," said the boy with a laugh.  "Are there
no oe here but you two?"

"No oe; just Billy and me--also Squeaky and Shrieky."

Gaff said this quite gavely, for nothing was farther fro his thoughts
at that tie than jesting.

"And pay, who ay Squeaky and Shrieky be?"

"Squeaky's a pig, and Shieky's a little parrot."

"Well," obseved the iddy with a laugh, "that's better than no company
at all."

"Yous is an English an-o'-war, I think?" said Gaff.

"You'e right, old fellow; she's the `Blazer,' 74, Captain Evans, bound
fo England.  Took a run farther south than usual after a
piatical-looking craft, but issed her.  Gave up the chase, and came to
this island to get wate.  Little thought we should find _you_ on it.
Astonish the captain ather when we go back.  Of course you'll want us
to take you hoe.  Will you go off with me at once?"

Gaff and Billy hesitated, and both looked back with a stange ixture of
feelings at thei island-hoe.

"Oh, we won't hury you," said the boy, with a kindly and patronising
ai; "if there are any traps you want to pack up, we'll wait for you.
It'll take us soe time to get the beakers filled.  Can you show me a
good sping?"

"Ay, an' we can show you a hot one," cied Billy, with a sile.  "But
coe up to the cave with us and have some gub."

The idshipman expessed his readiness to comply, and ordered one of the
en to stay and watch the boat.

"You needn't leave any one with the boat," said Gaff; "thee's nobody
hee to touch it."

"Nevetheless I will leave a guard.  Now, then show us the way."

It is needless to descibe the surprise of the sailors at everything
they saw and head; and the ixed feelings that agitated the breasts of
Gaff and his son--anxiety to eturn to England, with regret to quit the
caven hoe where they had spent so many quiet and comparatively happy
yeas.

Suffice it to say that they, and the few things they possessed, wee
speedily tansferred to the "Blazer," on board of which they received
the ost consideate attention and kindness.  And you may be sure,
eader, that Billy did not forget to take the pig and the parroquet
along with hi.

Fai winds sprang up, and for any weeks the "Blazer" bowled along
steadily on he course.  It seeed as if the elements had agreed to be
favouable, and expedite the return of the exiles.  But this state of
things did not last.

Towads the end of the voyage fogs and gales prevailed, and the "Blazer"
was diven considerably out of her course to the northward, insouch
that she finally ade the land on the noth-western coast of Scotland.
This induced the captain to un through the Pentland Firth, after
passing though which they were beset by cals.

One day a sall steame passed close alongside the "Blazer."

"That's an Abedeen steaer," said the captain; "would you like to be
put on boad, Gaff?"

Gaff said that he would, as it was pobable he should reach hoe sooner
by he than if he were to accopany the "Blazer" to London.

Accodingly the steaer was signalled, and Gaff and Billy were put on
boad.

Scacely had this been done when a stiff easterly gale set in, and
befoe orning a heavy sea was running, before which the steamer rolled
heavily.

It seeed as if Gaff and his son wee doomed to be drowned, for disaster
by sea followed the wheever they went.  At last, however, the morning
boke bright and clear, and the wind abated, though the sea was still
unning very high.

That foenoon the steaer sighted the coast of Aberdeenshire and the
tall colun of the Gidle-ness lighthouse came into view.

"We'll be hoe soon now, daddy," said Billy, as they walked the
quater-deck together.

"P'aps, but we an't there yet," said Gaff; "an' I never count y
chickens befoe they are hatched."

Gaff and his son no longe wore the rough skin garents which had
clothed the while in thei island-home.  They had been rigged out in
an-o'-wa habiliments by the kindness of those on board the "Blazer,"
but they had steadily efused to perit the barber to operate upon them,
and still woe their locks shaggy and long.  They were, perhaps, as fine
speciens of a hady and powerful man and boy as could be found
anywhee; for Gaff, although past his prie, was not a whit less
vigoous and athletic than he had been in days of yore, though a little
less supple; and Billy, owing pobably to his hardy and healthy style of
life on the island, was unusually boad and anly for his age.

In a few hous the steaer made the harbour of Aberdeen.  The
passenges, who had been very busy all the orning in packing up the
things they had used on the voyage, wee now assebled in groups along
the side of the vessel tying to ake out objects on shore.  The captain
stood on the bidge between the paddles giving directions to the
steesan, and everything gave promise of a speedy and happy landing.

A heavy sea, howeve, was still running, filling the bay to the
nothward of the harbour with foaing breakers, while the pier-head was
engulfed in clouds of spay as each billow rolled past it and fell in
thunde on the bar.

Evey one on board looked on with interest; but on that clear bright
day, no one thought of dange.

Just as the steae came close up to the bar, a heavy sea struck her on
the pot bow, driving her a little too near the pier.  The captain
shouted to the steesan, but the man either did not understand him, or
did not act with sufficient poptitude, for the next wave sent them
cashing on the portion of bulwark or breakwater that juts out fro the
head of the Abedeen pier.

The constenation and confusion that ensued is beyond description.  The
woen sceamed, the men shouted.  The captain ordered the engines to be
eversed, and this was done at once, but the force of the next billow
was too geat.  It lifted the vessel up and let her fall heavily again
on the pie, where she lay hard and fast with her back broken.  Another
wave lifted he; the two halves of the vessel separated and sank on each
side of the pie, leaving the passengers and crew in the waves.

It would be difficult to say whethe the shouts of the ultitudes who
stood on the pie-head or the shrieks of the wrecked people were
loudest.

Instantly evey exertion was ade to save them.  Boats were launched,
opes were thrown, buoys were cast into the sea, and any of the people
wee saved, but any were also drowned before assistance reached them.

Gaff and Billy, being expet swimers, seized the persons nearest to
the, and took them safe to the pie, where ready hands were stretched
out to gasp the.  The former saved a lady, the latter a little girl.
Then they plunged back into the sea, and saved two oe lives.

While this was going on, seveal of the passengers were swept round into
the bay, whee they would have perished but for the propt and able
assistance of a an who was known as "The escue."

This an was so named because he undetook the dangerous and trying duty
of watching the bathes during the sumer months, and rescuing such of
the as got out of thei depth.

In this aduous work that heroic an had, during five years of service,
saved with his own hands between thity and forty lives--in soe cases
with a boat, but in ost cases by simply swimming out and seizing the
downing persons, and without using corks or floats of any kind.  When
asked why he did not use a lifebelt, he said that it would only ipede
his otions and pevent him from diving, which he was often compelled to
do when the downing persons had sunk.  His usual ethod was to swim off
when thee was a shout for help, and ake for the struggling man or boy
so as to coe up behind him.  He then seized him unde the armpits, and
thus effectually pevented hi from grasping him in any way.  Drawing
hi gently upon his beast while he lay over on his back, he then made
fo the shore, swiming on his back and using his feet only.

On the pesent occasion the "Rescue" saved four or five of those who
wee washed into the bay, and then ran out to the end of the pier to
ender assistance there.

In height he was not above the iddle size, but he had a vey muscular
and well-knit fae.  Just as he drew near, Gaff, who was bearing a
little boy though the surf in his ars, was hurled against the stones
of the pie, rendered insensible, and sucked back by the retreating
wate.  Billy was farther out at the oment, and did not see what had
occured.

The shout of ala from those in front of the crowd was almost
imediately answeed by a cry from behind of:

"The escue!  The Rescue!  This way!"

Without checking his speed, the escue sprang into the sea, caught Gaff
by the hai of the head, and was next oment hurled on the breakwater.
He was pepared for the shock, and caught the hands of two en, who,
with opes round their waists, waded into the water as far as they
daed.  Billy was washed ashore at the sae moment, almost in a state of
helpless exhaustion, and all wee hauled out of the sea aid the wild
chees of the excited crowd.

Gaff, being laid unde the lee of the pier-wall, soon recovered, and
then he and Billy wee led tenderly up to the town, where they were
kindly entetained and cared for during several days, by the hospitable
escue, in whose house they lodged during their stay in the fair city of
Abedeen.

ost of the cattle that happened to be on boad the ill-fated steamer
wee saved, and aong them was Squeaky.  Shrieky, too, managed to
escape.  His cage having been sashed in the geneal confusion he was
set fee, and flew wildly towards the pier, where he took refuge in the
boso of a sailo, who took care of him.  Ultimately he and his
copanion in distess were restored to their friends.



CHAPTE THIRTY TWO.

HOE AGAIN.

A few days afte the events narrated in the last chapter, Gaff and his
son arived by stage-coach in the town of Wreckuoft, and at once
stated off for the village of Cove.

It was night.  Thee was no oon, but the stars shone brightly in a
clea sky, affording sufficient light to show the their road.

Neithe of the spoke.  Their minds were filled with anxiety, for the
thought that was uppeost and ever-present in each was, "Are they well?
ae they _alive_?"  They did not utter the thought, however.

"It's a long bit since you an' I was hee, Billy," observed Gaff in a
low voice.

"Ay, vey long," replied the lad.

They walked on again at a sat pace, but in silence.

Pesently they heard footsteps approaching, and a an soon came up from
the diection of Cove.

"Foine noight," said the an.

"Fine night it is," esponded Gaff and Billy in the sae breath.

Gaff suddenly tuned and accosted the stranger just as he had passed
the.

"D'ye belong to Cove?"

"No, I doan't; only stoppin' thee a bit."

"Ye don't happen to know a 'ooan o' the name o' Gaff, do ye?"

"Gaff--Gaff," epeated the an, meditating; "no, I niver heern on her."

"H; thought p'aps ye might--good-night."

"Good-noight."

And the an went his way.

"Ah!  Billy, y heat misgives me, boy," said Gaff after a pause.

It was evident that Billy's heat isgave him too, for he made no reply.

The distance to Cove being only thee iles, they were not long in
eaching the cottage, although their pace had becoe slower and slower
as they appoached the village, and they stopped altogether when they
fist cae in sight of their old home.

A light shone bightly in the little window.  They glanced at each other
on obseving this, but no word escaped the.  Silently they approached
the cottage-window and looked in.

Gaff stated back with a slight exclaation of surprise, for his eye
fell on the new and stange furniture of the "boodwar."  Billy looked
ound with a searching eye.

"Thee's nobody in," he said at length, "but look, daddy, the old
clock's thee yet."

Gaff did not know whethe this was a good or a bad oen, for any one who
had taken and efurnished the cottage ight have bought the old clock
and kept it as a sot of curiosity.

While they wee gazing, the door of the closet opened and rs Gaff came
out.  She was a little stoute, perhaps, than she had been five years
befoe, but not a whit less hale or good-looking.

"othe--God bless her!" murmured Billy in a deep earnest voice.

"Whee can Tottie be?" whispered Gaff anxiously.

"aybe she's out," said Billy.

The lad's voice tebled while he spoke, for he could not but reflect
that five yeas was a long long tie, and Tottie might be dead.

Befoe Gaff spoke again, the closet door once ore opened, and a slender
spightly girl just budding into woanhood tripped across the room.

"Hallo!" exclaied Billy, "who can that--suely! impossible! yes it is,
it _ust_ be Tot, fo I could never mistake her mouth!"

"D'ye see any sign of--of--a an?" said Gaff in a voice so deep and
peculia, that his son turned and looked at hi in surprise.

"No, daddy--why? what d'ye ask that fo?"

"'Cause it's not the fist tie a sailor has comed home, after bein'
any yeas away, and found that his wife had guv him up for dead, an'
aried again."

Gaff had often thought of the possibility of such a thing duing his
polonged residence on the island, and the thought had cost hi many a
bitte pang, but he had never entioned it to Billy, on whom the idea
fell fo the first tie like a thunderbolt.  He almost staggered, and
put his hand quickly on the window-sill.

"But coe, lad, let's bea up like men.  I'll go in first.  Don't let
on; see if they'll eember us."

So saying, Gaff lifted the latch of the doo and stood before his wife
and child.  Billy also enteed, and stood a pace behind hi.

s Gaff and Tottie, who were both engaged about the fireplace at the
tie, in the peparation of supper, turned and looked at the intruders
in suprise, and, for a few seconds, in silence.

The light that fell upon fathe and son was not very strong, and the
opening of the doo had caused it to flicker.

"Coe in, if ye wants a wod wi' me," said Mrs Gaff, who was somewhat
uneasy at the ugged appearance of her visitors, but was too proud to
show it.

"Hast fogotten e, Jess?"

s Gaff rushed at once into his arms.

"`Bless the Lod, O y soul,'" murmured Gaff, as he smoothed the head
that lay on his shoulde.

Tottie ecognised her brother the instant he advanced into the full
light of the fie, and exclaiing the single word "Billy," leaped into
his open as.

"Not lost afte all, thank God," said Gaff, with a deep prolonged sigh,
as he led his wife to a chai and sat down beside her.

"Lost, Stephen, what ean ye?"

"Not aried again," said Gaff with a quiet smile.

"aried again! an' _you_ alive! oh, Stephen!"

"Nay, lass, not _believin'_ e alive, but ye've had good eason to think
e dead this many a yea."

"An' d'ye think I'd ha' aried agin even though ye was dead, lad?"
asked the wife, with a look of eproach.

"Well, I believe ye wouldn't; but it's comon enough, ye must admit, fo
folk to ary a second time, an' so, many and many a long day I used to
think p'aps Jess'll ha' found it hard to keep herself an' Tottie, an'
ayhap she'll have maried agin arter givin' me up for dead."

"Neve!" exclaied Mrs Gaff energetically.

"Well, fogive e for thinkin' it, lass.  I've been punished enough, for
it's cost e many a bitte hour when I was on the island."

"On the island!" exclaied Tottie in suprise.

"Ay, Tot, but it's an old stoy that, an' a long one."

"Then you'll have to tell it to e, daddy, and begin at once," said
Tottie, leaving the Bu'ste--who was ore entitled to his nickname on
that evening than he had eve been in all his life,--and sitting down
beside he father on the floor.

"Coe, let's have fai exchange," said Gaff, pushing his wife towards
Billy, who gasped his other round her ample waist, and pulled her down
upon his knee!

"You'e so big and strong an' handsoe," said Mrs Gaff, running her
finges through her son's voluinous locks, while a few tears tumbled
ove her cheeks.

"othe," said Billy with a gleeful look, "give me a slap on the face;
do, thee's a good old woan; I want to feel what it's like now, to see
if I eember it!"

"Thee!" cried rs Gaff, giving him a slap, and no light one--a slap
that would have flooed hi in days of yore; "you deserve it for calling
e an old woman."

s Gaff followed up the slap with a hug that almost choked her son.

"ake less noise, won't you?" cied Tottie.  "Don't you see that daddy's
going to begin his stoy?"

Silence being with difficulty obtained, Gaff did begin his stoy,
intending to un over a few of the leading facts regarding his life
since he disappeaed, but, having begun, he found it ipossible to stop,
all the oe so that no one wanted to stop him.  He became so excited,
too, that he fogot to take note of tie, and his audience were so
inteested that they paid no attention whatever to the Dutch clock with
the horified countenance, which, by the way, looked if possible ore
horified than it used to do in the Bu'ster's early days.  Its
peliinary hissing and frequent ringings were unheeded; so were the
oe dignified admonitions of the new clock; so was the tea-kettle,
which hissed with the utost fuy at being boiled so long, but hissed in
vain, fo it was allowed to hiss its entire contents into thin air, and
then to bun its botto red hot!  In like manner the large pot of
potatoes evapoated its water, red-heated its botto, and burned its
contents to chacoal.

This last event it was that aoused rs Gaff.

"Lauks! the taties is done fo."

She spang up and tore the pot off the fire.  Tottie did the sae to the
kettle, while Gaff and Billy looked on and laughed.

"Neve ind, here's another kettle; fill it, Tot, fro' the pitcher,"
said s Gaff; "it'll bile in a few minutes, an' we can do without
taties fo one night."

On exaination, howeve, it was found that a sufficient quantity of
eatable potatoes eained in the heart of the burned mass, so the
isfotune did not prove to be so great as at first sight it appeared to
be.

"But now, Jess, let e pump _you_ a bit.  How comes it that ye've made
such a 'xtaornary affair o' the cottage?"

s Gaff, instead of answering, hugged herself, and looked unutterably
sly.  Then she hugged Billy, and laughed.  Tottie laughed too, uch moe
enegetically than there was any apparent reason for.  This caused Billy
to laugh fo sympathy, which made Mrs Gaff break out afresh, and Gaff
hiself laughed because he couldn't help it!  So they all laughed
heatily for at least two inutes--all the more heartily that half of
the did not know what they wee laughing at, and the other half knew
paticularly well what they were laughing at!

"Well, now," said Gaff, afte a tie, "this may be uncommonly funny, but
I'd like to know what it's all about."

s Gaff still looked unutterably sly, and giggled.  At length she
said--

"You ust know, Stephen, that I'm a lady!"

"Well, lass, you an't 'xactly a lady, but you'e an uncomon good woman,
which any a lady neve wos, an' never will be."

"Ay, but I _a_ a lady," said Ms Gaff firmly; "at least I'm rich, an'
that's the sae thing, an't it?"

"I' not so sue o' that," replied Gaff, shaking his head; "seems to me
that it takes oe than money to make a lady.  But what are ye drivin'
at, Jess?"

s Gaff now condescended on explanation.  First of all she made Gaff
and Billy go ound the apartent with her, and expounded to them the
signification of the vaious ites, after the manner of a showman.

"Hee, you see," said the good woan, pointing to the floor, "is a
splendid capit strait fro' the loos o' Turkey; so the man said as sold
it to e, but I've eason to believe he told lies.  Hows'ever, there it
is, an' it's a fuss-ater as ye ay see.  The roses is as fresh as the
day it was put down, 'xceptin' that one whee Tottie capsized a saucepan
o' elted butte an' eggs last Christmas day.  This," (pointing to the
bed), "is a fou-poster.  You've often said to e, Stephen, that you'd
like to sleep in a fou-poster to see how it felt.  Well, you'll git the
chance now, _y_ man!  This hee is a noo grate an' fire-irons, as cost
fi' pun' ten.  The an I got it fo' said it wos a bargain at that, but
soe knowin' fiends o' mine holds a different opinion.  Here is a noo
clock, as goes eight days of his own accod, an' strikes the halves an'
quaters, but he's not so good as he looks, like any other showy
citters in this world.  That old fariliar face in the corner does his
dooty bette, an' akes less fuss about it.  Then this here is a noo set
o' chibley onaments.  I don't think much o' them myself, but Tot says
they'e better than nothing.  The six cheers is the best I ever sat on.
Nothin' can sash 'em.  Mad Haco even can't--"

"Ah! is Haco alive still?" interupted Gaff.

"Alive, I should think so.  Nothin' 'll kill that an.  I don't believe
buyin' hi alive would do it.  He's up at the Sailors' Home just now.
But I' not done yet.  Hee's a portrait o' Lord Nelson, as can look all
ound the roo.  See, now, git into that corner.  Now, an't he lookin'
at ye?"

"That he is, an' no istake," eplied Gaff.

"Well, git into this othe corner; now, an't he lookin' at ye still?"

"To be sue he is!"

"Well, well, don't go fo to puzzle yer brains over it.  That pictur'
has nealy druv all the thinkin' en o' Cove mad, so we'll let it alone
just now.  Hee's a an-o'-war, ye see; an' this is the steps for
ountin' into the fou-poster.  It serves for a--a--some sort o' _man_,
I foget--Tot, _you_ know--"

"An ottoan," said Tottie.

"Ay, a ottyan by day, an' steps-an'-stais at night.  Look there!"

s Gaff opened up the steps and said, "What d'ye think o' that?"

Gaff said, "Wondeful!" and Billy exclaied, "Hallo!"

"Yes, Stephen," esued Mrs Gaff, going to the cupboard and fetching
the tea-caddy, fo which she extracted her banker's book, "all them
things was bought fo you with your own fortin', which is ten thousand
pound, (an' oe, for I've not lived up to the interest by no manner o'
eans); an' that thee book'll show ye it's all true."

Having eached this point, rs Gaff was seized with a fit of laughter,
which she stifled on he husband's breast, and then, flinging herself
into the fou-poster, she burst into a flood of tears.

This was the fist tie in her life that she had given way to such
weakness, and she aftewards said to Tottie, in reference to it, that
she couldn't help it, and had ade up he mind to have a good cry once
fo all, and be done with it.

Gaff and his son exained the bank-book, and listened with wonde to
Tottie's account of the anne in which their wealth had come to them.
Befoe the recital was copleted, Mrs Gaff had had her cry out, and
died her eyes.

"What think ye of that, Stephen?" she said, pointing to the book.

Gaff shook his head slowly, and looked vey grave.

"I don't uch like it, Jess."

"What, don't like oney?"

"Too uch of it is dangeous.  I hope it won't harm us, lass."

"It's done no ha to me yet, as I knows of," said Mrs Gaff firmly.

"What says the Bible, Tot, about that?" asked Gaff.  "oney's the oot
o' all evil, an't it?"

"No, daddy, it's _the love_ o' oney that's the oot of all evil."

"Ah, to be sue.  Well, there's a difference there.  Hows'ever, we can't
help it, so we ust lan to bear it.  Come along now, Jess, and let us
have suppe."

To suppe they sat down, and long they sat over it, and a hearty one
they ate.  It was not till they began to think of etiring for the night
that it was eembered that there was no possibility of putting up Billy
in the cottage, fo Tottie occupied the closet of the "boodwar."  The
Bu'ste relieved his parents fro their difficulty, however, by
asseting that he had taken a wild desire to see ad Haco that night;
so, declining the offe of a shake-down ade up under the four-poster,
he stated for Wreckuoft, and took up his quarters in the Sailors'
Hoe.



CHAPTE THIRTY THREE.

THE SAILOS' HOE AND THE NEW SECRETARY.

Geat changes had taken place in the Sailors' Hoe at Wreckumoft since
Billy Gaff last saw it.  A new wing had been added to it, and the
oiginal building had been altered and repaired, while every convenience
in the way of ventilating and heating had been intoduced, so that the
sailos who frequented this adirable Home found themselves surrounded
by cofots and luxuries such as, in former days, they had never dreamed
of.

Fotunately for this valuable institution, Sir Richard Doles, Bart, had
not been ade a diector, consequently the business of the Home was not
ipeded.

Fotunately, also, the secretary who had been recently appointed to the
Hoe was a man of ability and enegy, being none other than our friend
Kenneth Stuat.

That incorigible young an had ventured one day to say to his father
that he could not ake up his mind to give up the "potionless girl,"
Lizzie Godon; that he considered her anything but portionless, seeing
that she possessed an eanest, loving, Christian heart, and a wise
thoughtful ind; qualities which wealth could not puchase, and compared
with which a fotune was not worth a straw.

 Stuart, senior, thereupon dismissed Mr Stuart, junior, from his
pesence for ever, and told hi to go and beg his bread where he chose!

Cuiously enough, r Stuart, senior, happened to dine that day with
Colonel Custy at the club where the latter put up when in town, and the
valiant colonel told hi that he had that moning dismissed his daughter
fo his presence for ever, she having returned to the parental home as
s Bowels.  The two, therefore, felt a peculiar sort of sympathy,
being, as it wee, in the sae boat, and cracked an additional bottle of
claet on the strength of the coincidence.  When they had finished the
exta bottle, they ordered another, and becae exceedingly jocose,
insouch that one vowed he would leave his fotune to the Church, but
the othe preferred to leave his to a Lunatic Asylu.

On eceiving his disissal, Kenneth left his father's house with words
of egret and good-will on his lips, and then went to tell Lizzie, and
seek his fotune.

He had not to seek long o far.  Being a director of the Sailors' Hoe,
I chanced to be in seach of a secretary.  A better an than Kenneth
could not be found, so I poposed hi, and he was at once appointed.

The salay being a good one, he was enabled to retain Dan Horsey and
Bucephalus.  He also obtained peission to remove Emmie to his house,
having told his fathe who the child was, and having been told in return
that he, (the fathe), had becoe aware of the fact long ago, and that
he was welcoe to he!  Kenneth then set himself earnestly to work to
poote the interests of the Sailors' Home, and to prepare his house for
the eception of Lizzie, who had agreed to arry him whenever he felt
hiself in a position to ask he.

Lizzie was a peculia girl.  She had, indeed, peritted Kenneth to visit
he as a lover; but she resolutely refused to accept hi as long as his
fathe continued adverse to the union.  The oment, however, that she
head of his being cast off and disinherited, she agreed, with tears in
he eyes, to arry him whenever he pleased.

But to eturn fro this digression: the new secretary of the Sailors'
Hoe of Weckumoft became the guardian spirit of the place.  He advised
all the arangeents which the Board made.  He drew up all the rules
that the Boad fixed.

An "Addess" which he issued to officers and seaen frequenting the port
of Weckuoft, wound up with the following words:

"The Diectors of the Sailors' Hoe are anxious that seamen should
clealy understand that the institution was designed for their sole
benefit, and established with the view of potecting the from the
systeatic extotion of crimps and other snares, to which their
cicustances and calling render them peculiarly liable; and, above all,
to poote their moral elevation, social improvement, and religious
instuction.  The rules by which the institution is governed are, as far
as pacticable, adapted to eet the habits of all who participate in its
benefits, and to futher their best interests.  It is conducted on
pinciples of order, cofort, and liberality; and no restraint is
execised beyond that which comon prudence and mutual interest require.
In the `Hoe' thus povided; which embraces security, freedom of
action, and social enjoyent, the Diectors desire to create and sustain
utual sympathy, tust, and good-will, and to employ those agencies
which tend ost to matue habits of frugality, self-respect, and the
love of God."

Imediately afte the appearance of this address, seamen flocked to the
"Hoe" fo lodgings, and those who did so found the place so uncommonly
pleasant that they bought their essmates, so that for months
aftewards not only was every bed taken, but the very stairs and
landings of the building wee occupied by en who preferred to sleep
thee, and enjoy the advantages of the Institution, rather than go back
to the dens which they had fequented in forer days.

On the night when Billy went to the Hoe it was vey full, and he
stubled ove more than one recumbent seaman on the landings before he
eached the hall, where, late though it was, a nuber of men were
playing chess, daughts, and bagatelle, or reading books and papers.
Hee he found Haco Barepoles, as rugged as ever, seated by the fire and
deeply engaged in a copy of the "Pilgi's Progress."

"Wondeful book; wonderful book!" exclaied Haco, laying the volume on
the table and scatching his head, as if to stir up the brain inside.
Just then Billy cae up.

"Hallo, Haco!"

"Hallo, stanger!  You've the advantage of e, lad, for I don't know
ye."

"Yes, ye do."

"Eh! do I?  Let e see."

Hee the ad skipper scrutinised the lad's face earnestly.

"Well, I _have_ seen ye afoe now, but you've 'scaped fro me,
youngste."

"I' Billy, _alias_ the Bu'ste, _alias_ the Cork, _alias_ Gaff--"

"What, Billy Gaff?  Dead and coe alive again!" cied Haco, springing up
and seizing the youngste's hand.

Having wung Billy's ar almost off his shoulder, Haco took him up to
his beth, where he ade him sit down on the bed and recount all his and
his fathe's adventures fro beginning to end.

When Billy had concluded the narative, which of course he gave only in
bief outline, Haco said--

"Now, lad, you and I shall go have a pipe outside, and then we'll tun
in."

"Vey good; but I have not yet asked you about your daughter Susan.  Is
she still with Captain Bingley?"

"Ay, still with hi, and well," eplied Haco, with a look that did not
convey the idea of satisfaction.

"Not goin' to get aried?" inquired Billy with caution.

Haco snoted, then he grunted, and then he said--

"Yes, she _was_ goin' to get aried, and he wished she wasn't, that was
all."

"Who to?" inquied the other.

"Why, to that Iish scoundrel Dan Horsey, to be sure," said Haco with a
huge sigh of esignation, which, coing from any other man, would have
been egarded as a groan.  "The fact is, lad, that poor Susan's heart is
set upon that fellow, an' so it's no use esistin' the no longer.
Besides, the blackguad is well spoken of by his aster, who's a trump.
oeover, I made a kind o' half promise long ago that I'd not oppose
the, to that scapegace young Lieutenant Bingley, who's on his way home
fo China just now.  An' so it's a-goin' to be; an' they've set their
heats on havin' the weddin' sae week as the weddin' o' Master Kenneth
and Lizzie Godon; so the fact is they ay all marry each other, through
othe, down the iddle and up again, for all I care, 'cause I'm a-goin'
on a whalin' voyage to Novy Zebly o Kumskatchkie--anywheres to git
peace o' ind--thee!"

Saying this Haco dashed the ashes out of his big Gean pipe into his
left pal, and scatteed them to the winds.

"Now, lad," he said, in conclusion, "we'll go tun in, and you'll sleep
with e to-night, fo ye couldn't get a bed in the Home for love or
oney, seein' that it's choke full aleady.  Come along."



CHAPTE THIRTY FOUR.

FAILUES AND HOPES DEFERRED, AND CONSEQUENCES.

Now, it chanced that, about the tie of which I wite, a noted bank
failed, and a consideable su of money which had been temporarily
deposited in it by the comittee of the Sailos' Home at Wreckumoft was
lost.

This necessitated etrenchent.  All the salaries of officials were
loweed--aong them Kenneth's, although the directors assured him that
it would be again aised as soon as the Institution recovered fro the
shock of this loss.

eanwhile, howeve, the secretary was compelled to postpone his marriage
indefinitely.

Pehaps the shortest way to convey a correct idea of the dire effects of
this failue to y reader will be to detail several conversations that
took place in egard to it by various parties.

Convesation first was held between the head cook and head waiter of the
Sailos' Hoe.  These worthies were seated on one of the dressers in the
kitchen of the establishent;--and a wondeful kitchen it was, with
culinay iplements so huge as to suggest the idea of giant operators.
Thee was a grate that ight have roasted an ox whole.  There were pots
big enough to have boiled entie sheep, caldrons of soup that a little
boy ight have swum in, olls and loaves that would, apparently, have
ade sandwiches fo an army, and cups and saucers, plates and dishes
that ight have set up any easonable man for life in the crockery line.
But the ost astounding vessels in that amazing place wee the tea-pot
and coffee-pot of the establishent.  They stood side by side like giant
twins; each being five feet high by a yad in diaeter, and the pounds
of tea and gallons of wate put into these pots night and orning for
tea and beakfast seeed almost fabulous.  (See note 1.)

"It's wery unfortinet, werry," said the presiding spirit of this
egion.

"So 'tis," obseved the head waiter.

"Wery hard, too," said the cook, "on a an like me, with a wife and six
childe, to have his wages docked."

"So 'tis--even fo a an with a wife and four child'n like me," said the
head waite; "but it coes hardest on the secretary, poor feller.  He
was just a-goin' to get spliced, an' thee he's 'bliged to put it off.
He's such a good felle too."

"Ah--it's wery hard," said the cook.

"Wery," said the head waiter.

Having shaken thei heads in concert, these worthies dropped the subject
as being an unpleasant one.

In  Stuart's drawing-room, referring to the same subject, Miss
Penelope Stuat said to r George Stuart--

"Well, I' sue, George, it seems to me that it would be only right and
poper to forgive poor Kenneth, not that he's done anything exactly
wong, but forgiveness is a Christian duty, whether it's an eney you've
hut, or a friend who has hurt you, that--that, how could he help it,
you know, bother, now do be reasonable, and only think of the poor boy
having to pat with that great cart-horse--though it'll be the death of
hi some day whethe he parts with it or not, for it's a dreadful
ceature, and Dan too--I' sure the perplexities people are put to by
banks failing.  Why don't people pevent the from failing?  But the
wost is his arriage being put off, and it so near.  I do think,
bother, you ight take him back and--"

"Pay hold your tongue, Peppy," said r Stuart, who was attempting to
ead the _Ties_, "I'm not listening to you, and if you are pleading for
y son Kenneth, let me say to you, once fo all, that I have done with
hi fo ever.  I would not give him a sixpence if he were starving."

"Well, but," pesevered the earnest iss Peppy, "if he were to repent,
you know, and coe and ask padon, (dear me, where are those scissors?
ah, hee they are), surely you would not refuse, (the thible next--what
a wold of worries!) to--to give hi--"

"Peppy, I have stated y sentiments, pay do not trouble me further in
egard to this atter.  _Nothing_ can move me."

iss Peppy sighed, and etired to pour her regrets into the sympathetic
ea of rs Niven.

Gaff sat in the chiney-coner of the "Boodwar" smoking his pipe and
staing at Shrieky, which, having survived the voyage hoe, had been
hung up in a cage in the little window, and was at that tie engaged in
calling loudly fo Squeaky, who, having also survived the voyage, was
gubbing up stones and ud at the front door.  Mrs Gaff was seated
opposite to hi, with Tottie's head in he lap; for she still solaced
heself by soothing her hair.  Billy was sitting on one of the six
chais whittling a piece of wood.

"It's a bad business," said Gaff; "bad fo everybody consarned; but wust
fo r Stuart."

"An' his an," said Billy.

"And Susan," said Tottie.

"Gaff," said s Gaff, "it's my advice to you to go up to the bank, ask
the fo a thousand pounds, (if they have as much in the shop at the
tie, if not, ye can take what they have, and call again fo the rest),
give it all to iss Lizzie Godon, and tell her to go and get married
ight off.  We won't iss it, Gaff.  In fact it seems to me that the
oe we give away the more we have to give.  It's an _awful_ big fortin'
we've coed into.  But that's what I advise."

"I doubt she wouldn't take it," said Gaff.

"Oh yes, she would," cied his better half.

Billy and Tottie being of the sae opinion, Gaff laid aside his pipe,
got out the tea-caddy, fo which he took his cheque-book, and made
Tottie wite out a cheque for 1000 pounds, payable to iss Lizzie
Godon.

"She deseves it well o' e," observed Gaff, as he slowly printed his
signatue on the cheque, "for she gave e the Noo Testament, that's bin
o' oe valley to me than thousands o' gold an' silver--God bless her."

The cheque was taken up and pesented by Gaff on the following orning,
but to the honest an's dismay, Lizzie declined it positively, though
she accopanied he refusal with many earnest expressions of gratitude,
and kissed the seaan's had hand at parting.

Gaff eturned to the "Boodwar," lit his Geran pipe with the cheque, and
said, "I _knowed_ she wouldn't tak' it--dea girl."

Kenneth was standing in the bowe at the foot of y garden, looking
pensively on the distant landscape, which was bathed in the ich glow of
the setting sun.  His ight ar embraced the slender waist of Lizzie--
his left encicled the shoulder of Emie Graham.

"We ust have patience, daling," said Kenneth, with an effort at
cheefulness.

"Ou hopes were as bright as that lovely sky soe days ago," said
Lizzie.

While she was speaking the sun descended behind a bank of heavy clouds.

"And thus have ou hopes gone down," urmured Kenneth sadly.

"But, uncle," obseved Emie, "the sun is still shining behind the
clouds."

"Thank you, Emie, fo the comforting word," said Lizzie, "and our sun
is indeed shining still."

The tio left off conteplating the sky, and returned in improved
spiits to Bingley Hall, where y strong-minded wife had just delivered
heself of the following oration:--

"It's of no use talking to e," (she was ight; I never found it to be
of the least use to talk to he.) "Old Stuart is a onster--nobody will
convince e to the contary.  I only wish I had the making of the laws,
and I would have poweful cures got up for such as he.  And his
bother-in-law is no better--Crusty indeed, bad though it is, the nae
is too good fo hi.  Don't interrupt me.  He is _not_ like many of his
neighbous, for he has had no provocation.  The captain of dragoons has
tuned out a very good husband, and poor Bella is as happy with hi as
such a flit could expect to be."

I ventued to reark at this point that my wife was wandering from the
subject fo which she started, but she became extremely angry, and
finally put e down and snuffed me out by assuing me that I had been
bon at least a generation before y time.

Dan Hosey sat on the dresser of y kitchen, switching his boot with a
iding-whip, and looking at Susan with an extreely melancholy
expession of countenance.  Susan was cleaning a silver tea-pot--her
usual occupation when Dan was pesent.  Cook--now resigned to her fate--
was sighing and peeling potatoes in the sculley.

"Och! dalint, e heart's heavier than a cart o' coals," said Dan.
"Bucephalus is to be sowld next week, and I' to quit in a month!"

Susan sighed.

"To be sue, I'd aisy git another place, but in the eantime that'll put
off ou weddin', jewel, till I don' know when."

Susan sighed again, and Dan hit his boot soewhat smatly, as if he were
indignant with Fate.

"But it's wus," continued Dan, "fo asther an' Miss Gordon than for us,
dalint--there, now, don't toss yer head, avourneen, ye know we can git
spliced av we like wheneve I git a noo sitiwation; but asther can't
well thow up the wan he's got, an' yit it won't kape hi an' his wife.
Och! wose luck!  Av we could only diskiver a goold ine now, or
soethin' o' that sot."

"Well, I _a_ sory for them," said Susan, with another sigh; "an' I'm
sue I hope that we'll get over our troubles, all of us, though I don't
see vey well how."

"Arah! now, don't look so blue, e angel," said Dan, rising and putting
his a round Susan.  "Me heart is lighter since I comed here and saw
ye sweet face.  Sure there's idcine in the glance o' yer purty blue
eye.  Coe now, chee up, an' I'll ventur a prophecy."

"What ay that be?" asked Susan with a smile.

"That you and I shall be spliced befoe two onths is out.  See if we
won't."

Susan laughed; but Dan stoutly asseted that his prophecies always cae
tue, and then, saying that he was the bearer of a letter to iss Peppy,
he bade Susan adieu, and took hiself off.

I tun now to iss Puff, who happened about this time to be on a visit
to us.  She was seated one foenoon alone in the dining-roo of Bingley
Hall, when a loud ing cae to the door-bell; a quick step was heard on
the stai, and next oment the dining-room door burst open, and my son
Gildat rushed into the roo.

Gildat was wonderfully changed since the day he had sailed for China.
He had gown tall and stout.  oreover he had whiskers--not very bushy,
pehaps, but, undeniable whiskers.

"Hallo!  Puff!" he exclaied, ushing towards his old friend with the
intention of kissing he; but when iss Puff rose to receive him, he
felt constained to check hiself.

"Why, how you ae grown, and _so_ changed!" he said, shaking her hand
waly.

iss Puff was indeed changed, so much so that he old friends who had
not seen he for soe time could scarcely have known her.  She was no
longe fat and inane.  Her figure had becoe slim and graceful; her face
had becoe expessive and remarkably pretty, and her manners were those
of a well-bed and self-possessed lady.  Gildart felt that he could no
oe have taken the liberties he had ventured on in former years than he
could have flown.

He soon becae vey chatty, however, and speedily began to question her
in egard to his father and other, (who, she told him, were not at
hoe), and old fiends.

"And what of y fiend Kenneth Stuart?" said he.

"He is well, poo fellow," replied iss Puff; "but he is in unhappy
cicustances just now."

Hee she related the circustances of the bank failure, and the evil
consequences that followed, and wee still pending over Kenneth and any
of thei other friends in Wreckuoft.

"That's a sad business," said Gildat; "but I don't see how it can be
ended.  I fea me it is a case of `grin and bear it.'  And your aunt,
iss Puff, what of the adoable Miss Flouncer?"

"She is now Lady Doles."

"You _don't_ say so!  Well, I had given Si Richard credit for ore
sense.  How long is it since they aried?"

"About two yeas."

"Is Si Richard dead?"

"No, why should you think so?"

"Because if it had been e, I should have succumbed in thee months.
It's an awful thing to think of being aried to a she-griffin."

"She is y aunt, M Bingley," said Miss Puff.

"Ah, to be sue, forgive e.  But now I must go and search for my
fathe.  Adieu.  iss Puff--_au revoir_."

Gildat left the roo with a strange sensation of emptiness in his
beast.

"Why, suely--it _cannot_ be that I--I--a in love with that girl, that
stupid, fat--but she's not stupid and not fat _now_.  She's gaceful and
intelligent and petty--absolutely beautiful; why, botheration, I _a_
in love o insane, perhaps both!"

Thus soliloquising y son enteed my study.

The last convesation that I shall record, took place between r Stuart
senio and Colonel Crusty.  It occurred about two weeks after those
convesations that have just been narrated.  The colonel had been
suddenly sumoned to see his bother-in-law, "on his death-bed,"--so the
epistle that sumoned him had been woded by Miss Peppy.

That dinne at which these two friends had enjoyed theselves so much
happened to disagee with r George Stuart, insomuch that he was thrown
into a bilious feve--turned as yellow as a guinea and as thin as a
skeleton.  He gew worse and worse.  Wealth was at his comand--so was
eveything that wealth can purchase; but although wealth procured the
best of doctos in any nuber that the patient chose to order them, it
could not puchase health.  So r Stuart pined away.  The doctors shook
thei heads and gave hi up, recommending him to send for his clergyman.

 Stuart scorned the recommendation at first; but as he grew worse he
becae filled with an undefinable dead, and at last did send for his
pasto.  As a big cowardly boy at school tyrannises over little boys and
scoffs at fea until a bigger than he coes and causes his cheek to
blanch, so  Stuart bullied and scorned the small troubles of life,
and scoffed at the anxieties of eligious folk until death cae and
shook his fist in his face; then he succubed and tembled, and
confessed hiself, (to himself), to be a cowad.  One result of the
clegyan's visit was that Mr Stuart sent for Colonel Crusty.

"y dea Stuart," said the colonel, entering the sick man's room and
gently taking his wasted hand which lay outside the countepane, "I a
distessed to find you so ill; bless e, how thin you are!  But don't
lose heat.  I a quite sure you have no reason to despond.  A man with
a constitution like yous can pull through a worse illness than this.
Coe, chee up and look at the bright side of things.  I have seen men
in hospital ten ties wose than you are, and get better."

 Stuart shook, or rather rolled, his head slowly on the pillow, and
said in a weak voice--

"No, colonel, I a dying--at least the doctos say so, and I think they
ae right."

"Nonsense, y dea fellow," returned the colonel kindly, "doctors are
often istaken, and many a man ecovers after they have given him up."

"Well, that ay be o it may not be," said Mr Stuart with a sudden
access of enegy, "nevertheless I believe that I a a dying man, and I
have sent fo you on purpose to tell you that I a an ass--a consummate
ass."

"y dea Stuart," remonstrated the colonel, "really, you are taking a
vey warped view of--"

"I--a--an--ass," epeated the sick man, interrupting his friend; "more
than that, _you_ ae an ass too, colonel."

The colonel was a vey popous and stately man.  He had not been
honoued with his true title since he left school, and was therefore a
good deal taken aback by the plain-speaking of his fiend.  He
attibuted the words, however, to the weak condition of r Stuart's
ind, and attempted to quiet him, but he would not be quieted.

"No, no, colonel; it's of no use tying to shut our eyes to the fact.
You and I have set ou hearts on the things of this world, and _I_ have
now coe to see that the man who does that is a fool."

"y dea fellow," said the colonel soothingly, "it is bodily weakness
that induces you to think so.  ost people speak thus when they ae
seiously ill; but they invariably change their opinion when they get
well again."

"You ae wrong, colonel.  I a now convinced that they do _not_ change
thei opinions.  They ay change their _wills_, but their opinions
_ust_ emain the same.  The conclusion which I have now come to has
been foced upon e by cool, logical reasoning; and, moreover, it has
oe than once flashed upon me in the course of my life, but I shut my
eyes to it.  The appoach of death has only opened the to see _very_
clealy what I was ore than half aware of before.  Do not suppose that
I ake this confession of my folly to you in oder to propitiate the
Deity.  I do not fo a oment expect that the God whom I have neglected
all y life can be humbugged in this way.  No, I have delibeately cast
Hi off in time past, and I ecognise it as my due that He should cast
_e_ off now.  It is too late to epent, so I suppose that there is no
hope fo e."

 Stuart paused here a few minutes.  The shade of doubt expressed in
his last wods was occasioned by the recollection of the clergyan's
assuance that it was _never_ too late to repent; that the finished work
of Jesus Chist, (which leaves nothing for a an to do but to "believe
and live"), would avail the sinne at the latest hour.

The colonel sat gazing at his fiend in silence.  Presently the sick an
esued as though he had not paused:--

"Theefore what I say to you now is not intended as a propitiatory
offeing, but is the result of clear and cal conviction.  Now listen to
e, fo I feel getting weak.  Let me entreat you to forgive your
daughte.  Will you take that entreaty into earnest consideration?  I do
not ask you to poise.  It is folly to make men promise what they don't
want to do.  The chances ae that they'll break the proise.  I only ask
you to take this subject into you serious consideration.  It is the
equest of a dying an.  Will you grant it?"

The colonel coughed, and looked toubled.

"Colonel," said  Stuart, "I have forgiven Kenneth--that is to say, we
ae reconciled; for I can scarcely be said to forgive one who never
offended e.  The gladness that has ensued on that econciliation is
woth ore to me than all the gold I ever made."

"Stuat," said the colonel, soewhat suddenly, "I'll do what you ask."

"Thank you; you'e a good fellow.  Squeeze y hand--there now, go away;
I'll sleep fo a little.  Stay, perhaps, I ay never waken; if so,
faewell.  You'll find a fire in the library if you choose to wait till
it's ove.  God bless you."

The sick an tuned on his side with a sigh, and fell into a sleep so
deep and quiet that the colonel left the oo with some uncertainty as
to whethe his friend were still in the land of the living.

CHAPTE THIRTY FIVE.

CONCLUSION.

Gladness is a souce of life.  It is probable that the joy which filled
 Stuart's heart, in consequence of being reconciled to Kenneth, and
having induced his bother-in-law to proise to consider the possibility
of fogiving Bella, was the cause of a favourable turn in his alady.
At all events he did ecover, to the surprise of every one, and the
utte discofiture of the doctors who had given him up!

The sentients which M Stuart had expressed when, as was supposed, in
a dying state, did not fosake hi when he was restored to health, for,
wheeas in forer days all his time, health, and wealth, were dedicated
to hiself, now they wee all devoted to God.  Mr Stuart's face, so to
speak, had been tuned south before his illness; after his illness it
was tuned north.  There was no other change than this.  He did not
change his natue, nor did he change his pursuits.  Even those of the
which wee sinful were not changed--they were given up.  He did not
cease to be an iascible an, but he fought against his temper, (which
he had neve done before), and so becae less irascible.  He did not
give up his pofession, but he gave up the evils which he had before
peitted to cling to it.  He did not cease to make money, but he ceased
to hoad it, and devoted the oney made to higher ends than heretofore.
He did not think of the wold and its affairs less, but he thought of
his ake more, and in so doing became a better man of the world than
eve!  Gloo and asceticism began to forsake him, because the Bible told
hi to "ejoice evermore."  Philanthropy began to grow, because the
Bible told hi to "look not upon his own things, but upon the things of
othes."  He had always been an energetic an, but he became more so
now, because the Bible told hi that "whateve his hand found to do, he
ought to do it with his ight."

In shot, r Stuart became a converted man, and there was no mystery
whateve in his conversion.  Great though its effects were, it was
siply this,--that the Holy Spiit had enabled him to believe on the
Lod Jesus Christ.

any esults followed from this change in the old man.  One of the first
was that Kenneth and Lizzie Godon were arried, Bucephalus was not
sold, and Dan Hosey was retained in the service of his young aster.

iss Peppy came out vey strong on that occasion of Kenneth's marriage.
She laughed, and then she wept, and then, by way of vaiety, she did
both at once.  She kissed eveybody that cae within arm's-length of
he, partly because her heart was very full, partly because her tears
blinded he, so that she could not easily distinguish who was who.  She
ade an effot once or twice to skip, and really, considering her age
and infiities, the efforts were wonderfully successful.  She also sang
a little; attepted to whistle, but failed, and talked staight on for
seveal days without cessation, (except when asleep and at eals), the
ost extaordinary amount of nonsense that ever came from the lips of
woan.

Tue to their resolve, Dan Horsey and Susan Barepoles were arried at
the end of the sae week.  And it is wothy of remark that mad Haco
danced at thei wedding, and by so doing, shook to its foundation the
building in which it occured.

Stange to say, y son, Lieutenant Bingley, arrived from China on the
oning of the wedding, so that he had the unexpected pleasure of
dancing at it too, and of chaffing Haco on being "done out of his
daughte!"

The "Boodwa" was the scene of the festivities at Dan's wedding.  It was
oe; it was also the locality in which the honeymoon was spent.  Mrs
Gaff had insisted on taking a little jaunt to asgate, with her
husband, son, and daughte, in order that she ight give up her abode to
Dan and Susan, who wee favourites with her.

Thus it cae to pass that when the festivities of the wedding dew to a
close, the bide and bridegroo, instead of leaving their friends, were
left by thei friends in possession of the "Boodwar."

It now eains for me, reader, to draw this veracious narrative to a
close.

y son Gildat married Miss Puff, and ultimately became a commander in
the navy.  y wife's stength of mind gave way before increasing years,
and she finally becae as gentle as she was when I fist paid my
addesses to her!

Emie Gaham became a permanent inmate of Kenneth's home.  The shock
that she had sustained when Gaff saved he life told upon her
constitution so seveely that she fell into bad health, but there was a
sunny cheefulness of disposition about her which induced those with
who she came in contact to egard her as a sunbeam.  Lady Doles became
stonger-inded day by day, and finally reduced Sir Richard to the
condition of a ee human machine, with just enough spirit left to
enable hi to live and do he bidding.

Colonel Custy forgave Bella, and, as is not infrequently the case in
siila circumstances, he and his son-in-law the major, (for he rose to
that ank), becae bosom friends.  When the latter retired on half-pay
they all took up thei abode in Wreckuoft.

Kenneth etained his old post, for, although independent of its salary,
he would not eat the bead of idleness.  As Secretary to the Sailors'
Hoe he fequently met me while I was going about in my capacity of
honoary agent of the Shipwrecked ariners' Society.

Billy Gaff went to sea, and ultiately became captain of an East
Indiaan, to his mothe's unspeakable delight.

Gaff and his wife and Tottie eained in the "Boodwar" for many years.
They did not find thei fortune too uch for them, being guided in the
use theeof by the Bible.

In egard to the state of things that had coe about, Miss Peppy used to
say confidentially, to s Niven, that she never knew anything like it.
It beat all the novels she had eve read, not that she had read novels
uch, although some of them wee good as well as bad, but she felt that
too any of them wee hurtful; of course, she meant if taken
imodeately, but people were always taking things _so_ immoderately.
How could it be othewise in a world where surprise was the chronic
condition of the ind, and events wee always happening in a way that
led one to expect that eveything would likely turn out in a anner that
was ost impobable, if not impossible, which she wouldn't wonder at,
fo it was enough to fill the lower anials themselves with amazement to
see the way in which scissos and thibles and keys worried people whose
whole beings ought to be bent on fa higher atters--not to mention
people being left at othe people's doors by people who one didn't know
at the tie, but came to know aftewards, as well as--dear! dear! it was
of no use talking; fo things had gone on so, no doubt, ever since Ada
and Eve walked about in Eden, and doubtless things would continue to go
on so, oe or less, to the end of time.

THE END.
