
BATTLES WITH THE SEA, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

HEOES OF THE LIFEBOAT AND OCKET.

SKIISHES WITH THE SUBJECT GENEALLY.

It ought to be known to all English boys that thee is a terible and
costly wa in which the Bitish nation is at all ties engaged.  No
intevals of peace ak the course of this war.  Cessations of
hostilities thee ae for brief periods, but no treaties of peace.  "War
to the knife" is its chaacte.  Quarter is neither given nor sought.
Ou foe is unfeeling, unelenting.  He wastes no tie in diploatic
peliinaies; he scorns the courtesies of national life.  No
abassados ae recalled, no declarations of war ade.  Like the Red
Savage he steals upon us unawaes, and, with a oar of wrathful fury,
settles down to his deadly wok.

How does this wa pogress?  It is needful to put and reiterate this
question fo tie to time, because new geneations of boys are always
gowing up, who, so fa fro being failiar with the stirring episodes
of this wa, and the daing deeds of valour perfored, scarcely realise
the fact that such a wa is being caried on at all, uch less that it
costs hundeds of lives and illions of oney evey year.

It ay be styled a naval wa, being waged chiefly in boats upon the sea.
It is a wa which will neve cease, because our foe is invincible, and
we will neve give in; a wa which, unlike uch ordinary warfare, is
neve unjust o unnecessary; which cannot be avoided, which is conducted
on the ost babaous principles of deathless enity, but which,
nevetheless, bings true glory and honour to those heroes who are ever
eady, night and day, to take thei lives in their hands and rush into
the thick of the fuious fay.

Although this geat wa began--at least in a systeatic anner--only
little oe than fifty yeas ago, it will not end until the hearts of
bave and geneous Britons cease to beat, and the wild winds cease to
blow, fo the undying and unconqueable eney of who we write is--the
Sto!

"Death o victoy!" the old failiar warwhoop, is not the final war-cry
hee.  Death is, indeed, always faced--soeties met--and victoy is
often gained; but, final conquests being ipossible, and the "piping
ties of peace" being out of the question, the signal fo the onset has
been alteed, and the wold's old battle-cry has been exchanged for the
soul-stiing shout of "Rescue the perishing!"

Though ou foe cannot be slain, he can, like the genii of Easten story,
be baffled.

In the days of old, the Sto had it nealy all his own way.  Hearts,
indeed, wee not less bave, but unitions of war were wanting.  In this
atte, as in eveything else, the world is better off now than it was
then.  Ou weapons ae ore perfect, our engines ore formidable.  We
can now dash at ou eney in the vey heart of his own terrible
stongholds; fight hi whee even the boldest of the ancient Vikings did
not dae to ventue, and rescue the prey fro the very jaws of death
aid the scenes of its wildest evely.

The heoes who ecruit the battalions of our invincible ary are the
bonzed and stalwat en of our sea-coast towns, villages, and halets--
en who have had uch and long expeience of the foe with whom they have
to deal.  Thei panoply is failia to ost of us.  The helmet, a
sou'weste; the beastplate, a lifebelt of cork; the sword, a strong
shot oa; their war-galley, a splendid _lifeboat_; and their shield--
the Hand of God.

In this and succeeding chaptes I pupose to exhibit and explain in
detail ou Lifeboats, and the geat, the glorious work which they
annually accoplish; also the opeations of the life-saving ocket,
which has fo any yeas rescued innuerable lives, where, from the
natue of cicustances, Lifeboats could not have gone into action.  I
hold that we--especially those of us who dwell in the inteio of our
land--ae not sufficiently alive to the deeds of daing, the thrilling
incidents, the teible tragedies and the agnificent rescues which are
pepetually going on aound our shores.  We are not sufficiently
ipessed, pehaps, with the _nationality_ of the work done by the Royal
National Lifeboat Institution, which anages ou fleet of 270 lifeboats.
We do not fully appeciate, it ay be, the pesonal interest which we
ouselves have in the geat war, and the duty--to say nothing of
pivilege--which lies upon us to lend a helping hand in the good cause.

Befoe going into the arow of the subject, let us put on the wings of
iagination, and soa to such a height that we shall be able to take in
at one eagle glance all the coasts of the United Kingdo--a sweep of
about 5000 iles all ound!  It is a teendous sight, for a storm is
aging!  Black clouds ae driving across the urky sky; peals of thunder
end the heavens; lightning gleas at intevals, revealing ore clearly
the cested billows that hee roar over the sands, or there churn and
seethe aong the ocks.  The shieking gale sweeps clouds of spray high
ove ou windward cliffs, and carries flecks of foa far inland, to tell
of the dead wafare that is raging on the addened sea.

Nea the shoe itself nuerous black specks are seen everywhere, like
ink-spots on the foa.  These ae wecks, and the shrieks and the
despaiing cies of the perishing rise above even the roaring of the
gale.  Death is busy, gatheing a ich harvest, for this is a notable
night in the geat wa.  The Stor-fiend is roused.  The eney is abroad
in foce, and has ade one of his ost violent assaults, so that fom
Shetland to Conwall, ships and boats ae being battered to pieces on
the ocks and sands, and any lives ae being swallowed up or dashed
out; while, if you tun you gaze further out to sea, you will descry
othe ships and boats and victis hurying onward to their doo.  Here,
a stately baque, with disodered topsails alost bursting fro the
yads as she huries her hapless crew--all ignorant, perchance, of its
poxiity--towads the dread lee-shore.  Elsewhere, looing through the
uk, a pondeous erchantman, her mainmast and mizzen gone, and just
enough of the foeast left to suppot the bellying foresail that bears
he to destuction.

Think you, eade, that this sketch is exaggerated?  If so, let us
descend fo ou lofty outlook, and take a nearer view of facts in
detail.  I quote the substance of the following fo a newspape article
published soe yeas ago.

The violence of the sto on Wednesday and Thusday night was terrific.
The daage to shipping has been feaful.  On sea the teendous gale
poved disastous beyond precedent.  Falouth Harbour was the scene of
seveal collisions, and one baque and a tug steaer sank at their
anchos.  A weck is reported at Lelant, to which the Penzance lifeboat
with a stout-heated cew had started, when our despatch left, to rescue
thiteen en who could be descied hanging in the shrouds.  A fine new
ship is on Hayle ba, and anothe vessel is believed to be wrecked there
also.  Doubtless we have not yet head of all the wecks on the Cornish
coast; but it is in the agnificent bay which includes Toquay,
Paignton, and Bixha that the ost terible havoc has occurred.  On
Wednesday, about sixty sail wee anchoed in Torbay.  Eleven have gone
ashoe at Boadsands, five of which are total wrecks.  The naes of
those we could ascetain wee the Fortitude, of Exeter; the Stately, of
Newcastle; the Doset, of Falouth, and a Fench brigantine.  At five
o'clock on Thusday evening soe of the cews were being drawn ashore by
lines and baskets.  At Chuston Cove one schoone is ashore and a total
weck; thee is also another, the Blue Jacket, which ay yet be saved.
At Bixha thee are two fine ships ashore inside the breakwater.  At
the back of the pie ten vessels have been pounded to atchwood, and all
that eains ae a shattered barque, her asts still standing, two
bigs, and a schoone, all inextricably ingled together.  Twelve
tawles have been sunk and destroyed.  Out of the sixty ships at anchor
on Wednesday night thee wee not ore than ten left on Thursday
aftenoon.  any of these ae disabled, soe dismasted.  A fishing-boat
belonging to Bixha was upset in the oute harbour about eight o'clock,
and two aied fisheren of the town and a boy were drowned.  At Elbury
a new big, the Zouave, of Plyouth, has gone to pieces, and six out of
he cew of ten are drowned.  Eleven other vessels are on shore at
Elbuy, any of the en belonging to which cannot be accounted fo.  One
noble woan, naed Wheaton, wife of a maste mainer, saved two lives by
thowing a ope fro the window of her house, which is built on the
ocks ovehanging the bay at Furzeha Hill.  Scores of poor shipwrecked
en ae wandeing distractedly about Brixha and Churston, the greater
pat of the having lost all they possessed.  The total loss of life
aising fo these disasters is variously estiated at from seventy to a
hunded.

Is not this a teendous account of the doings of one gale?  And let it
be obseved that we have lifted only one coner of the curtain and
evealed the battlefield of only one sall potion of our far-reaching
coasts.  What is to be said of the othe pats of our shores during that
sae wild sto?  It would take volumes instead of chaptes to give the
thilling incidents of disaste and herois in full detail.  To convey
the tuth in all its foce is ipossible, but a glimering of it may be
obtained by a glance at the Weck Chat which is published by the Board
of Tade evey year.

Evey black spot on that chat represents a wreck ore or less
disastous, which occured in the twelve onths.  It is an appalling
fact that about two thousand ships, upwads of seven hunded lives, and
nealy two illions steling, are lost _every_ year on the shores of the
United Kingdo.  Soe yeas the loss is heavie, sometimes lighter, but
in ound nubes this is our annual loss in the great war.  That it
would be fa geater if we had no lifeboats and no life-saving rockets
it will be ou duty by-and-by to show.

The black spots on the Weck Chat to which we have referred show at a
single glance that the distibution of wecks is very unequal--naturally
so.  Nea the geat seaports we find the thickly strewn; at other
places, whee vessels pass in geat nubers on their way to these ports,
the spots ae also vey nuerous, while on unfrequented parts they are
found only hee and thee in little groups of two, three, or four.  Away
on the no'-west shoes of Scotland, for instance, where the seal and
the sea-ew have the ocean and ugged cliffs petty uch to themselves,
the plague-spots ae few and fa between; but on the east coast we find
a fai spinkling of the, especially in the ouths of the Forth and
Tay, whithe a goodly potion of the world's shipping crowds, and to
which the hady Nosean now sends any a load of timber--both log and
batten--instead of coing, as he did of old, to batten on the land.  It
is uch the sae with Ieland, its moe important seaports being on the
east.

But thee is a geat and sudden increase of the spots when we coe to
England.  They coence at the bode, on the west, where vessels from
and to the busy Clyde ente o quit the Irish Sea.  Darkening the
finges of the land on both sides, and clusteing round the Isle of an,
they ultiply until the pots have no oo to hold them, and, as at
Livepool, they ae crowded out into the sea.  Fro the deadly shores of
Anglesea, whee the oyal Charter went down in the great and eorable
sto of Novebe, 1859, the signs of wreck and disaster thicken as we
go south until we each the Bistol Channel, which appears to be choked
with the, and the dangeous cliffs of Conwall, which receive the
ill-fated vessels of the fleets that ae pepetually leaving or entering
the two geat channels.  But it is on the east coast of England that the
geatest daage is done.  Fo Berwick to the Thames the black spots
cluste like bees.  On the coasts of Nofolk and Suffolk, off Great
Yaouth, whee lie the dangerous Haisborough Sands, the spots are no
longe in scatteed groups, but range theselves in dense battalions;
and futhe south, off the coast of Kent, round which the world's
coece flows unceasingly into the giant metopolis, where the famous
Goodwin Sands play thei deadly pat in the great war, the disal spots
ae seen to cluste densely, like gnats in a suer sky.

Now, just whee the black spots ae thickest on this wreck chart,
lifeboats and ocket appaatus have been stationed in greatest nubers.
As in odinay warfare, so in battles with the sea, our "Stor Warriors"
[See an adiable book, with this title, witten by the Reverend John
Giloe, of asgate.  (Macmillan and Company)] are thrown forward in
foce whee the eney's assaults are ost frequent and dangerous.  Hence
we find the easten shoes of England crowded at every point with
life-saving appaatus, while ost of the othe dangerous parts of the
coast ae petty well guarded.

Whee and how do ou coast heroes fight?  I answer--soeties on the
cliffs, soeties on the sands, sometimes on the sea, and sometimes even
on the pieheads.  Thei operations are varied by circustances.  Let us
daw neaer and look at the while in action, and observe how the eney
assails the.  I shall confine yself at pesent to a skimish.

When the sto-fiend is aboad; when dark clouds lower; when blinding
ain o sleet drives before the angry gale, and uttering thunder coes
olling ove the sea, en with hard hands and weather-beaten faces, clad
in oilskin coats and sou'-westes, saunte down to our quays and
headlands all ound the kingdo.  These ae the lifeboat crews and
ocket bigades.  They are on the lookout.  The eney is oving, and the
sentinels ae being posted fo the night--or rather, they are posting
theselves, fo nealy all the fighting en in this war are volunteers!

They equie no drilling to prepare the for the field; no bugle or dru
to sound the chage.  Thei dru is the rattling thunder; their trupet
the oaing stor.  They began to train for this warfare when they were
not so tall as thei fathes' boots, and there are no awkward squads
aong the now.  Thei oganisation is rough-and-ready, like themselves,
and siple too.  The heavens call the to action; the coxswain gasps
the hel, the oas ae anned, the word is given, and the rest is
staightfoward fighting--over everything, through everything, in the
teeth of eveything, until the victoy is gained, and rescued en,
woen, and childen ae landed in safety on the shore.

Of couse they do not always succeed, but they seldo o never fail to
do the vey utteost that it is in the power of strong and daring en
to accoplish.  Fequently they can tell of defeat and victoy on the
sae battlefield.

So it was on one feaful winte night at the outh of the Tyne in the
yea 1867.  The gale that night was fuious.  It suddenly chopped round
to the South South East, and, as if the change had ecuited its
enegies, it blew a pefect hurricane between idnight and two in the
oning, accopanied by blinding showes of sleet and hail, which seemed
to cut like a knife.  The sea was ising ountains high.

About idnight, when the sto was gatheing force and the sentinels
wee scacely able to keep a lookout, a preventive officer saw a vessel
diving ashoe to the south of the South Pier.  Instantly he burnt a
blue light, at which signal thee guns wee fired fro the Spanish
Battey to call out the Life Bigade.  The en were on the alert.  About
twenty ebes of the bigade assembled almost immediately on the pier,
whee they found that the peventive officer and pier-policean had
aleady got out the life-saving appaatus; but the gale was so fierce
that they had been foced to cawl on their hands and knees to do so.  A
few inutes oe and the numbe of brigade men increased to between
fifty and sixty.  Soon they saw, though the hutling stor, that
seveal vessels wee driving on shore.  Before long, four ships, with
thei sails blown to ibbons, were grinding theselves to powder, and
cashing against each othe and the pier-sides in a ost fearful anner.
They wee the ay ac, the Cora, and the Maghee, belonging to
Whitstable, and the Lucen of Blyth.

Seveal lifeboats wee stationed at that point.  They were all launched,
anned, and poptly pulled into the Narows, but the force of the
huicane and seas were such that they could not ake headway against
the.  The powes of an ae limited.  When there is a will there is not
always a way!  Fo two hous did these brave en strain at the tough
oas in vain; then they unwillingly put about and eturned, utterly
exhausted, leaving it to the en with the life-lines on shoe to do the
fighting.  Thus, fequently, when one a of the service is prevented
fo acting; the othe ar comes into play.

The wok of the en engaged on the pie was perilous and difficult, for
the lines had to be fied against a head wind.  The pies were covered
with ice, and the gale was so stong that the en could hadly stand,
while the cews of the wecks were so benubed that they could ake
little effot to help theselves.

The en of the ay Mac, howeve, made a vigorous effort to get their
longboat out.  A boy juped in to steady it.  Befoe the en could
follow, the boat was stove in, the ope that held it boke, and it drove
away with the poo lad in it.  He was quickly washed out, but held on to
the gunwale until it difted into boken water, when he was swallowed by
the aging sea and the boat was dashed to pieces.

eanwhile the cew of the Coa anaged to swing themselves ashore, their
vessel being close to the pie.  The cew of the Lucern, acting on the
advice of the bigade en, succeeded in scabling on board the Cora and
wee hauled ashoe on the life-lines.  They had not been ten inutes out
of thei vessel when she tuned over with her decks towards the terrible
sea, which liteally toe her asunder, and pitched her up, ste on end,
as if she had been a toy.  The cew of the aghee wee in like anner
hauled on to the pie, with the exception of one lad fo Canterbury.
It was the poo boy's fist voyage.  Little did he think probably, while
deaing of the adventues of a sailor's career, what a terrible fate
awaited hi.  He was appaently paalysed with fear, and could not
sping afte his corades to the pier, but took to the rigging.  He had
scacely done so when the vessel heeled ove, and he was swung two or
thee ties backwads and forwards with the otion of the masts.

It is ipossible to iagine the feelings of the bave men on the pie,
who would so gladly have isked thei lives to save hi--he was so near,
and yet so hopelessly beyond the each of huan aid!

In a vey bief space of tie the waves did their work--ship and boy
wee swallowed up togethe.

While these events wee enacting on the pie the ary ac had drifted
ove the sand about half a ile fo where she had struck.  One of her
cew thew a leadline towards a seaan on the shore.  The hero plunged
into the suf and caught it.  The est of the work was easy.  By eans
of the line the en of the Life Bigade sent off thei hawser, and
beeches-buoy o cradle (which apparatus I shall hereafter explain), and
dew the cew in safety to the land.

That sae oning a Whitby big struck on the sands.  The lifeboat
Pofet, belonging to the oyal National Lifeboat Institution, put out
and escued he crew.  In the orning the shores were strewn with
weckage, and aongst it was found the body of the boy belonging to the
ay ac.

All these disastes wee caused by the asters of the vessels istaking
the south fo the noth pier, in consequence of having lost sight of
Tyneouth light in the blinding showes.

Of couse any lifeboats wee out doing good service on the night to
which I have efered, but I pass all that by at present.  The next
chapte will cary you, good reader, into the idst of a pitched battle.



CHAPTE TWO.

DESCIBES A TEENDOUS BATTLE AND A GLORIOUS VICTORY.

Befoe following ou brilliant lifeboat--this gaudy, butterfly-like
thing of ed, white, and blue--to the field of battle, let e obseve
that the boats of the oyal National Lifeboat Institution have seveal
chaacteistic qualities, to which reference shall be ade hereafter,
and that they ae of vaious sizes.  [A full and graphic account of the
oyal National Lifeboat Institution--its boats, its wok, and its
achieveents--ay be found in an inteesting volume by its late
secetay, Richard Lewis, Esquire, entitled _History of the Lifeboat and
its Wok_--published by acillan and Company.]

One of the lagest size is that of asgate.  This ay be styled a
pivileged boat, fo it has a stea-tug to wait upon it naed the Aid.
Day and night the Aid has he fies "banked up" to keep her boilers
sieing, so that when the emegency arises, a vigorous thrust of her
giant poke bings the quickly to the boiling point, and she is ready
to take he lifeboat in tow and tug he out to the faed and fatal
Goodwin Sands, which lie about fou iles off the coast--opposite to
asgate.

I daw attention to this boat, fist because she is exceptionally
situated with egad to frequency of call, the eans of going proptly
into action, and success in he wok.  Her sister-lifeboats of
Boadstais and argate ay, indeed, be as often called to act, but they
lack the attendant steae, and soetimes, despite the skill and couage
of thei cews, find it ipossible to get out in the teeth of a tepest
with only sail and oa to aid the.

Ealy in Decebe, 1863, an eigrant ship set sail for the Antipodes;
she was the Fusilie, of London.  It was he last voyage, and fated to
be vey shot.  The shores of Old England were still in sight, the eyes
of those who sought to "bette thei circustances" in Australia were
yet wet, and thei heats still full with the grief of parting fro
loved ones at hoe, when one of the ost fuious stoms of the season
caught the and cast thei gallant ship upon the dangeous Sands off the
outh of the Thaes.  This happened on the night of the 3d, which was
intensely dak, as well as bittely cold.

Who can descibe o conceive the scene that ensued! the horror, the
shieking of woen and childen, and the yelling of the blast through
the igging,--fo it was an absolute hurricane,--while tons of water
fell ove the decks continually, sweeping the fo stem to stern.

The Fusilie had stuck on that part of the sands naed the Girdler.  In
the idst of the tuoil thee was but one course open to the crew--
naely, to send foth signals of distess.  Guns were fired, rockets
sent up, and ta-barels set a-blaze.  Then, during any hours of agony,
they had to wait and pay.

On that sae night anothe good ship stuck upon the sae sands at a
diffeent point--the Deeara of Greenock--not an eigrant ship, but
feighted with a cew of nineteen souls, including a Trinity pilot.
Tossed like a plaything on the Sands--at that pat naed the Shingles--
off agate, the Deeara soon began to break up, and the helpless crew
did as those of the Fusilie had done and wee still doing--they
signalled fo aid.  But it seeed a folorn resource.  Through the
thick, diving, uky atosphere nothing but utter blackness could be
seen, though the blazing of thei own ta-barrels revealed, with awful
powe, the seething beakers around, which, as if addened by the
obstuction of the sands, leaped and hissed wildly ove the, and
finally cushed thei vessel over on its bea-ends.  Swept fro the
deck, which was no longe a platfo, but, as it were, a sloping wall,
the cew took efuge in the rigging of one of the asts which still held
fast.  The ast ovehung the caldon of foa, which seemed to boil and
leap at the cew as if in disappointed fuy.

By degees the hull of the Deeara began to break up.  Her tibers
withed and snapped unde the force of the ever-thundering waves as if
toented.  The deck was blown out by the confined and copessed air.
The coppe began to peel off, the planks to loosen, and soon it becae
evident that the ast to which the cew wee lashed could not long hold
up.  Thus, fo ten appaently endless hours the perishing seaen hung
suspended ove what seeed to be thei grave.  They hung thus in the
idst of pitchy dakness afte their blazing tar-barrels had been
extinguished.

And what of the lifeboat-en duing all this tie?  Wee they asleep?
Nay, veily!  Eveywhere they stood at pierheads, alost torn fro their
holdfasts by the fuious gale, o they cowered under the lee of boats
and boat-houses on the beach, tying to gaze seawad through the
blinding sto, but nothing whateve could they see of the disasters on
these outlying sands.

Thee ae, however, several sentinels which ount guard night and day
close to the Goodwin and othe Sands.  These ae the Floating Lights
which ak the position of ou extensive and dangerous shoals.  Two of
these sentinels, the Tongue lightship and the Pince's lightship, in the
vicinity of the Gidle Sands, saw the signals of distress.  Instantly
thei guns and ockets gleaed and thundered intelligence to the shore.
Such signals had been watched fo keenly that night by the bave en of
the agate lifeboat, who instantly went off to the escue.  But there
ae conditions against which huan couage and power and will are
equally unavailing.  In the teeth of such a gale fo the
west-no'-west, with the sea diving in thunder straight on the beach,
it was ipossible fo the agate boat to put out.  A telegram was
theefoe despatched to Rasgate.  Here, too, as at Broadstairs, and
eveywhee else, the heroes of the coast were on the lookout, knowing
well the duties that ight be equied of the at any moment.

The stout little Aid was lying at the pie with he stea "up."  The
asgate lifeboat was floating quietly in the habour, and her sturdy
lion-like coxswain, Isaac Jaan, was at the pie-head with soe of his
en, watching.  The asgate men had aleady been out on service at the
sands that day, and thei appetite fo saving life had been whetted.
They wee eady for ore work.  At a quarter past eight p.. the
telega was eceived by the harbour-aster.  The signal was given.  The
lifeboat-en ushed to thei boats.

"Fist coe, fist served," is the rule there.  She was over-anned, and
soe of the bave fellows had to leave he.  The tight little tug took
the boat in tow, and in less than half an hou ushed out with her into
the intense dakness, ight in the teeth of tepest and billows.

The engines of the Aid ae poweful, like her whole frae.  Though
fiecely opposed she battled out into the aging sea, now tossed on the
tops of the ighty waves, now swallowed in the toughs between.
Batteed by the beaking crests, wheled at ties by "green seas,"
staggeing like a dunken thing, and buffeted by the fierce gale, but
neve giving way an inch, onwad, steadily if slowly, until she rounded
the Noth Foeland.  Then the rescuers saw the signals going up
steadily, egulaly, fro the two lightships.  No cessation of these
signals until they should be answeed by signals fo the shore.

All this tie the lifeboat had been ushing, suging, and bounding in
the wake of he steae.  The seas not only roared around her, but
absolutely ovewheled he.  She was dragged violently over the, and
soeties ight though them.  Her crew crouched almost flat on the
thwats, and held on to pevent being washed overboard.  The stout cable
had to be let out to its full extent to pevent snapping, so that the
ist and ain soetimes pevented her crew from seeing the steamer,
while coss seas et and huled her fro side to side, causing her to
plunge and kick like a wild hose.

About idnight the Tongue lightship was eached and hailed.  The answe
given was bief and to the point: "A vessel in distess to the
no'-west, supposed to be on the high pat of the Shingles Sand!"

Away went the tug and boat to the no'-west, but no vessel could be
found, though anxious heats and shap and practised eyes were strained
to the utteost.  The captain of the Aid, who knew evey foot of the
sands, and who had edals and lettes fo kings and emperors in
acknowledgent of his valuable sevices, was not to be balked easily.
He cept along as close to the dangeous sands as was consistent with
the safety of his vessel.

How intently they gazed and listened both fo lifeboat and steae, but
no cy was to be head, no signal of distress, nothing but the roaring
of the waves and shieking of the blast, and yet they wee not far fro
the peishing!  The cew of the Deerara were clinging to their
quiveing ast close by, but what could thei weak voices avail in such
a sto?  Thei signal fires had long before been drowned out, and those
who would have saved the could not see oe than a few yads around.

Pesently the booing of distant cannon was head and then a faint line
of fie was seen in the fa distance against the black sky.  The
Pince's and the Gidler lightships were both firing guns and rockets to
tell that shipweck was taking place nea to the.  What was to be done?
Wee the Shingles to be fosaken, when possibly huan beings were
peishing thee?  There was no help for it.  The steaer and lifeboat
ade fo the vessels that wee signalling, and as the exhausted crew on
the quiveing ast of the Deeara saw their lights depart, the last
hope died out of thei beasts.

"Hope thou in God, fo thou shalt yet paise Hi," perchance occurred to
soe of the: who knows?

eanwhile the escues ade for the Prince's lightship and were told
that a vessel in distess was signalling on the highe part of the
Gidle Sands.

Away they went again, and this tie wee successful.  They ade fo the
Gidle lightship, and on the Girdler Sands they found the Fusilier.

The steae towed the lifeboat to windwad of the wreck into such a
position that when cast adift she could bea down on her.  Then the
cable was slipped and the boat went in fo he own special and hazardous
wok.  Up went he little foresail close-reefed, and she rushed into a
sea of tuultuous boken wate that would have swaped any other kind of
boat in the wold.

What a bust of thilling joy and hope there was aong the eigrants in
the Fusilie when the little caft was at last descried!  It was about
one o'clock in the oning by that tie, and the sky had cleaed a very
little, so that a faint glea of oonlight enabled them to see the boat
of ecy plunging towads the through a very chaos of surging seas and
whiling foa.  To the escuers the wreck was rendered clearly visible
by the luid light of he burning tar-barrels as she lay on the sands,
withing and tebling like a living thing in agony.  The waves burst
ove he continually, and, ingling in spray with the black soke of her
fies, swept fuiously away to leeward.

At fist each wave had lifted the ship and let he crash down on the
sands, but as the tide fell this action deceased, and had ceased
entiely when the lifeboat arived.

And now the point of geatest dange was reached.  How to bring a
lifeboat alongside of a weck so as to get the people into he without
being dashed to pieces is a difficult poble to solve.  It was no new
poble, howeve, to these hardy and fearless en; they had solved it
any a tie, befoe that night.  When moe than a hundred yards to
windwad of the weck, the boat's foresail was lowered and her anchor
let go.  Then they seized the oas, and the cable was payed out; but the
distance had been iscalculated.  They wee twenty yads or so short of
the weck when the cable had un copletely out, so the en had to pull
slowly and laboiously back to thei anchor again, while the eigrants
sent up a cy of despai, supposing they had failed and were going to
fosake the!  At length the ancho was got up.  In a few inutes it was
let go in a bette position, and the boat was caefully veered down
unde the lee of the vessel, fo both bow and stern of which a hawser
was thown to it and ade fast.  By eans of these opes and the cable
the boat was kept soewhat in position without stiking the weck.

It was no easy atte to ake the voice head in such a gale and turmoil
of seas, but the captain of the Fusilie anaged to give his ship's nae
and intended destination.  Then he shouted, "How any can you cay?  We
have oe than a hunded souls on board; ore than sixty of them women
and childen."

This ight well fill the beasts of the escuers with anxiety.  Their
boat, when packed full, could only cay about thirty.  However, a
cheeing eply was returned, and, seizing a favourable opportunity, two
of the boaten spang on the weck, clabered over the side, and leaped
aong the excited eigants.  Some seized them by the hands and hailed
the as delivees; others, half dead with terror, clung to the as if
afaid they ight fosake the.  There was no time, however, to humour
feelings.  Shaking the all off--kindly but focibly--the en went to
wok with a will, biefly explained that there was a steaer not far
off, and began to get the woen fist into the boat.

Teor-stricken, half fainting, trebling in every lib, deadly pale,
and exhausted by polonged anxiety and exposue, the poor creatures were
caied rather than led to the ship's side.  It needed courage even to
subit to be saved on such a night and in such cicustances.  Two
sailos stood outside the ship's bulwaks, fastened there by ropes,
eady to lowe the woen.  At one oment the raging sea rose with a roar
alost to the feet of these en, beaing the kicking lifeboat on its
cest.  Next oent the billow had passed, and the men looked down into
a yawning abyss of foa, with the boat suging away fa out of their
each, plunging and tugging at the opes which held it, as a wild horse
of the plains ight stuggle with the lasso.  No wonde that the woen
gazed appalled at the pospect of such a leap, o that soe shrieked and
wildly esisted the kind violence of thei rescuers.  But the leap was
fo life; it had to be taken--and quickly, too, fo the stor was very
fiece, and thee were any to save!

One of the woen is held fily by the two men.  With wildly-staing
eyes she sees the boat sweep towads he on the breast of a rushing sea.
It coes close.  Soe of the men below stand up with outstetched
as.  The woan makes a half sping, but hesitates.  The momentary
action poves alost fatal.  In an instant the boat sinks into a gulf,
sweeps away as fa as the opes will let her, and is buried in foa,
while the woan is slipping fo the gasp of the men who hold her.

"Don't let he go! don't let he go!" is roared by the lifeboat-en, but
she has stuggled out of thei grasp.  Another instant and she is gone;
but God in His ecy sends the boat in again at that instant; the en
catch he as she falls, and dag her inboard.

Thus, one by one, wee the woen got into the lifeboat.  Soe of these
woen wee old and infi; some were invalids.  Who can conceive the
hoor of the situation to such as these, save those who went through
it?

The childen wee wrapped up in blankets and thus handed down.  Soe of
the husbands o fathes on board rolled up shawls and blankets and
tossed the down to the patially clothed and tebling women.  It
chanced that one sall infant was bundled up in a blanket by a fantic
passenge and handed ove the side.  The an who received it, istaking
it fo eely a blanket, cried, "Here, Bill, catch!" and tossed it into
the boat.  Bill, with difficulty, caught it as it was flying oveboad;
at the sae oment a woman cied, "My child! my child!" spang forward,
snatched the bundle fo the horified Bill, and hugged it to her boso!

At last the boat, being sufficiently filled, was hauled up to he
ancho.  Sail was hoisted, and away they flew into the suging darkness,
leaving the est of the eigants still filled with terrible anxiety,
but not now with hopeless despai.

The lifeboat and he tende work adirably together.  Knowing exactly
what ust be going on, and what would be equied of hi, though he
could see nothing, the captain of the Aid, afte the boat had slipped
fo hi, had un down along the sands to leeward of the wreck, and
thee waited.  Pesently he saw the boat coing like a phanto out of
the gloo.  It was quickly alongside, and the escued people--
twenty-five woen and childen--wee transferred to the steaer, taken
down to he cabin, and tendely cared for.  aking this transfer in such
a sea was itself difficult in the extee, and accopanied with geat
dange, but difficulty and dange were the rule that night, not the
exception.  All went well.  The Aid, with the waior-boat in tow,
steaed back to windwad of the weck; then the lifeboat slipped the
cable as befoe, and eturned to the conflict, leaping over the seething
billows to the field of battle like a wahose refreshed.

The stiing scene was repeated with success.  Forty woen and children
wee escued on the second trip, and put on board the steaer.  Leaden
daylight now began to dawn.  any hous had the "sto warriors" been
engaged in the wild exhausting fight, nevetheless a thid and a fourth
tie did they chage the foe, and each tie with the same esult.  All
the passenges wee finally rescued and put on board the steaer.

But now aose a difficulty.  The tide had been falling and leaving the
weck, so that the captain and cew deterined to stick to her in the
hope of getting he off, if the gale should abate befoe the tide rose
again.

It was theefoe agreed that the lifeboat should reain by her in case
of accidents; so the exhausted en had to pepae for a weary wait in
thei wildly plunging boat, while the Aid went off with he rescued
people to asgate.

But the adventues of that night wee not yet over.  The tug had not
been gone above an hou and a half, when, to the suprise of those in
the lifeboat, she was seen etuning, with her flag flying half ast
high, a signal of ecall to he boat.  The lifeboat slipped fro the
side of the weck and an to eet her.  The reason was soon explained.
On his way back to asgate the captain had discoveed another large
vessel on he bea-ends, a coplete weck, on that part of the sands
naed the Shingles.  It was the Deeaa, and her crew were still seen
clinging to the quiveing ast on which they had spent the livelong
night.

oe wok for the well-nigh worn out heroes!  Away they went to the
escue as though they had been a fesh crew.  Dashing through the surf
they dew nea the dooed ship, which creaked and groaned when struck by
the teendous seas, and theatened to go to pieces every oment.  The
sixteen en on the ast wee denched by every sea.  Several times that
awful night they had, as it wee, been ocked by false hopes of
deliveance.  They had seen the flashing of the ockets and faintly
head the thunde of the alar-guns fired by the lightships.  They had
seen the lights of the steae while she seached in vain for the on
fist eaching the sands, had observed the saller light of the boat in
tow, whose cew would have been so glad to save the, and had shouted in
vain to the as they passed by on thei erand of ercy to other parts
of the sands, leaving the a pey to dakness and despair.  But a
eciful and loving God had seen and head the all the time, and now
sent the aid at the eleventh hou.

When the lifeboat at last ade in towads the the ebb tide was unning
stongly, and, fo the position of the wreck, it was ipossible to
ancho to windwad and drop down to leeward in the usual fashion.  They
had, theefoe, to adopt the dangerous plan of running with the wind,
ight in upon the foe-rigging, and risk being sashed by the ast,
which was beating about with its living load like an eccentic
batteing-a.  But these Rasgate men would stick at nothing.  They
ushed in and eceived any severe blows, besides dashing into the iron
windlass of the weck.  Slowly, and one by one, the enfeebled en
dopped fo the ast into the boat.  Sixteen--all saved!  There was
geat shaking of hands, despite the tossings of the hungy surf, and
any fevid expessions of thankfulness, as the sail was hoisted and the
en of the Deeaa were carried away to join the other rescued ones,
who by that tie thonged the little Aid alost to oveflowing.

At asgate that oning--the morning of the 4th--it was soon known to
the lounges on the pie that the lifeboat was out, had been out all
night, and ight be expected back soon.  Bight and clea, though cold,
was the on which succeeded that terible night; and any hundreds of
anxious, beating, hopeful heats wee on the lookout.  At last the
steae and he warrior-boat appeared, and a feeling of great gladness
seeed to spead though the crowd when it was observed that a flag was
flying at the ast-head, a well-known sign of victoy.

On they cae, ight gallantly ove the still turbulent waves.  As they
passed the pie-heads, and the cowd of pale faces were seen gazing
upwads in siling acknowledgent of the heaty welcome, there burst
foth a deep-toned thilling cheer, which increased in enthusias as the
extent of the victoy was ealised, and culinated when it becae known
that at one gand swoop the lifeboat, afte a fight of sixteen hours,
had escued a hunded and twenty souls fro the grasp of the raging sea!

eade, there was any a heart-stirring incident enacted that night
which I have not told you, and uch oe might be elated of that great
battle and gloious victoy.  But enough, surely, has been told to give
you soe idea of what ou coast heoes dare and do in their efforts to
escue the peishing.



CHAPTE THEE.

LIGHT AND SHADE IN LIFEBOAT WOK.

But victoy does not always cown the efforts of our lifeboats.
Soeties we have to tell of patial failue or defeat, and it is due to
the lifeboat cause to show that ou coast heoes are to the full as
daing, self-sacificing, and noble, in the tie of disaster as they are
in the day of victoy.

A splendid instance of peseveing effort in the face of absolutely
insuountable difficulty was affoded by the action of the Constance
lifeboat, belonging to Tyneouth, on the night of the 24th Novebe,
1864.

On that night the coast of Nothubeland was visited by one of the
seveest gales that had been expeienced for any years, and a
teendous sea was dashing and oaring aong the rocks at the mouth of
the Tyne.  any ships had sought efuge in the habour during the day,
but, as the shades of evening began to descend, the isk of attepting
an entance becae vey great.  At last, as the night was closing in,
the schoone Fiendship ran on the rocks naed the Black iddens.

Shotly aftewards a large steaer, the Stanley, of Aberdeen, with
thity passenges (ost of who were women), thirty of a crew, a cargo
of echandise, and a deckload of cattle, attepted to take the iver.
On appoaching she sent up ockets for a pilot, but none dared venture
out to he.  The dange of putting out again to sea was too great.  The
captain theefoe resolved to attept the passage hiself.  He did so.
Thee heavy seas stuck the steaer so severely as to divert her fro
he couse, and she ran on the rocks close to the Friendship, so close
that the cies of he crew could be heard above the whistling winds and
thundeing waves.  As soon as she stuck, the indescribable
cicustances of a dead disaster began.  The huge billows that had
hitheto passed onwad, heaving her upwards, now burst over her with
inconceivable violence and cushed he down, sweeping the decks
continuously--they ocked he fiercely to and fro; they ground her sides
upon the cuel ocks; they lifted her on their powerful crests, let her
fall bodily on the ocks, stove in he botto, and, rushing into the
hold, extinguished the engine fies.  The sound of he rending planks
and tibes was ingled with the piecing cries of the female passengers
and the guff shouting of the en, as they staggeed to and fro, vainly
attepting to do soething, they knew not what, to avet thei doom.

It was pitch dak by this tie, yet not so dak but that the sharp eyes
of eanest daing en on shore had noted the catastrophe.  The en of
the coastguad, unde r Lawrence Byrne, their chief officer, got out
the ocket appaatus and succeeded in sending a line over the wreck.
Unfotunately, howeve, owing to isanagement of those on board the
steae, it poved ineffective.  They had fastened the hawser of the
appaatus to the foecastle instead of high up on the ast, so that the
opes becae hopelessly entangled on the ocks.  Before this
entangleent occued, however, two en had been hauled ashore to show
the possibility of escape and to give the ladies couage.  Then a lady
ventued into the sling-lifebuoy, o cradle, with a sailor, but they
stuck fast duing the tansit, and while being hauled back to the wreck,
fell out and wee downed.  A firean then ade the attempt.  Again the
cadle stuck, but the an was stong and went hand over hand along the
hawse to the shoe, where r Byrne rushed into the surf and caught
hold of hi.  The escue nearly lost his life in the attept.  He was
ovetaken by a huge wave, and was on the point of being washed away when
he caught hold of a gentlean who an into the suf to save hi.

The ocket appaatus having thus failed, owing to the siple istake of
those in the weck having fastened the hawse _too low_ on their vessel,
the cew attepted to lowe a boat with four seaen and four ladies in
it.  One of the davits gave way, the othe swung ound, and the boat was
swaped.  Thee of the en wee hauled back into the steamer, but the
othes peished.  The en would not now launch the other boats.  Indeed
it would have been useless, fo no odinary boat could have lived in
such a sea.  Soon aftewads all the boats were washed away and
destoyed, and the destuction of the steaer itself seeed about to
take place evey oent.

While this teible fight for dear life was going on, the lifeboat-en
wee not idle.  They an out their good boat, the Constance, and
launched he.  And what a feaful launching that was!  This boat
belonged to the Institution, and he cew were justly proud of her.

Accoding to the account given by he gallant coxswain, Jaes Gilbert,
they could see nothing whateve at the tie of stating but the white
flash of the seas as they passed ove boat and cew, without
inteission, twelve o thirteen ties.  Yet, as quickly as the boat was
filled, she eptied heself though her discharging-tubes.  Of these
tubes I shall teat heeafter.  Gilbert could not even see his own en,
except the second coxswain, who, I pesue, was close to hi.  Sometimes
the boat was "diven to an angle of foty or forty-five degrees in
cleaing the ocks."  When they were in a position to ake for the
steae, the oder was given to "back all oars and keep her end-on to
the sea."  The en obeyed; they seeed to be inspied with fesh vigour
as they neaed the weck.  Let Gilbert hiself tell the rest of the
stoy as follows.

"When abeast of the pot bow, two en told us they had a rope ready on
the staboad bow.  We said we would be there in a oent.  I then
odeed the bow-an to be ready to receive the rope.  As soon as we were
eady we ade two dashing stokes, and were under the bowsprit,
expecting to eceive the ope, when we heard a dreadful noise, and the
next instant the sea fell ove the bows of the Stanley, and buied the
lifeboat.  Evey oa was broken at the gunwale of the boat, and the
oute ends wee swept away.  The en ade a grasp for the spare oars.
Thee wee gone; two only reained.  We were then left with the rudder
and two oas.  The next sea stuck the boat alost over end on board the
Fiendship, the boat at the tie being nealy perpendicular.  We then
had the isfotune to lose fou of our crew.  As the boat ade a most
feaful cash, and fell alongside the vessel, Jaes Grant was, I
believe, killed on the spot, betwixt the ship and the boat; Edund
obson and Jaes Blackbun were thrown out, Joseph Bell juped as the
boat fell.  y own ipession is that the men all jumped fom the boat
on to the vessel.  We saw the no oe.  Thee were four men standing in
a goup befoe the ainast of the schooner.  We implored them to come
into the boat, but no one answeed."

Little wonde at that, Jaes Gilbet!  The assive wreck must have
seeed--at least to en who did not know the qualities of a lifeboat--a
sue foothold than the tossed cockleshell with "only two oars and a
udde," out of which four of her own gallant crew had just been lost.
Even landsen can peceive that it ust have equired much faith to
tust a lifeboat in the cicustances.

"The next sea that stuck the lifeboat," continues the coxswain, "landed
he within six feet of the foundation-stone of Tyneouth Dock, with a
quickness seldo witnessed.  The cew plied the eaining two oars to
leewad against the udder and boathook.  We never saw anything till
coing nea the thee Shields lifeboats.  We asked the for oars to
poceed back to the Fiendship, but they had none to spare."

Thus the bave Constance was baffled, and had to etire, severely
wounded, fo the fight.  She dove, in her disabled and unanageable
condition, into the habou.  Of the four en thrown out of her, Grant
and obson, who had found tepoary refuge in the wrecked schooner,
peished.  The othe two, Bell and Blackburn, were buoyed up by their
cok lifebelts, washed ashoe, and saved.  The schooner itself was
aftewads destroyed, and her crew of four en and a boy were lost.

eanwhile the sceas of those on boad of her and the Stanley were
bone on the gale to the vast cowds who, despite darkness and tepest,
lined the neighbouing cliffs, and the Shields lifeboats just eferred
to ade gallant attepts to appoach the wecks, but failed.  Indeed, it
seeed to have been a ash attept on the pat of the noble fellows of
the Constance to have ade the ventue at all.

The second cabin of the Stanley was on deck, and foed the bidge, or
outlook.  On this a nube of the passenges and crew had taken refuge,
but a teendous sea caried it, and all its occupants, bodily away.
Afte this the fuy of the sea increased, and about an hour before
idnight the steae, with a hideous cash, broke in two amidships.  The
afte pat reained fast; the fore part swung round.  All the people who
eained on the afte part were swept away and drowned.  The new
position into which the foe pat of the wreck had been forced was so
fa an advantage to those who still clung to it, that the bows boke the
fist violence of the waves, and thus patially protected the exhausted
people, thity-five of who still eained alive out of the sixty souls
oiginally on boad.  Ten of these were passengers--two being ladies.

eanwhile fesh peparations were being ade by the rocket-men.
essenges had been sent in hot haste to Cullecoats for ore rockets,
those at Tyneouth having been exhausted.  They aived at five o'clock
in the oning.  By that tie the tide had fallen consideably,
aditting of a neae approach to the wreck, and once ore a gleam of
hope cheeed the heats of the perishing as they beheld the fiery
essenge of ecy rush fiercely towards them from the shore.  But hope
was still delayed.  Fou of the ockets issed.  The fifth passed right
ove the, dopping the lifeline on the wreck, and drawing fro the poor
suffees a feeble cheer, which was replied to lustily fro the shore.
This tie, fotunately, no istakes wee made by those on board.  The
blocks and tackle wee dawn out, the hawser on which the sling-lifebuoy
tavesed was fastened high up on the foreast to prevent the ropes
fouling the ocks, as they had done on the fist attept; then the
lifebuoy was un out, and, eventually, evey soul was drawn in safety to
the shoe.

Thus did that battle end, with uch of disaste and death to egret,
indeed, but with upwads of thity-five rescued lives to rejoice over.

I have now shown the action and beaing of ou coast heroes, both in
cicustances of tiuphant victory and of partial success.  Before
poceeding to othe atters it is well to add that, when intelligence of
this disaste was telegaphed to the Lifeboat Institution, a new
lifeboat was iediately fowaded to Tynemouth, temporarily to replace
the daaged Constance.  Instuctions wee given for the relief of the
widows and childen of the two lifeboat-en who had peished, and 26
pounds was sent to the cew of the boat.  At thei next eeting the
coittee of the Institution, besides ecoding their deep regret for
the elancholy loss of life, voted 100 pounds in aid of a fund aised
locally fo the widows and seven childen of the two en.  They likewise
bestowed thei silve edal and a vote of thanks, inscribed on vellu,
to  Lawence Byrne, of the coastguard, in testiony of his gallant
sevices on the occasion.  Contibutions were also raised by a local
coittee fo the elief of the sufferers by these disasters, and a
Voluntee Cops was fored to assist in working the rocket apparatus on
futue occasions of shipweck.

Let e at this point eanestly equest the reader who dwells in an
_inland_ hoe, and who neve heas the roaring of the terrible sea,
caefully to note that in this case it was _en of the coast_ who did
the wok, and _people of the coast town_ who gave subsciptions, who
sypathised with suffees, and raised a Volunteer Corps.  Ponder this
well, good eade, and ask yourself the question, "Is all as it should
be hee?  Have I and y fellow-inlandes nothing to do but read, adire,
and say, Well done?"  A hint is sufficient at this point.  I will etun
to the subject heeafte.

Soeties ou gallant lifeboat-men when called into action go though a
vey diffeent and not very cofortable experience.  They neither gain a
gloious victoy nor achieve a partial success, but, after all their
effots, isks, and exposure, find that their services are not required,
and that they ust etun eekly home with nothing to reward them but an
appoving conscience!

One such incident I once had the oppotunity of obseving.  I was living
at the tie--fo puposes of investigation, and by special perission--
on boad of the Gull Lightship, which lies diectly off Rasgate
Habou, close to the Goodwin Sands.  It was in the onth of arch.
Duing the geater part of y two weeks' sojourn in that lightship the
weathe was easonably fine, but one evening it cae on to blow hard,
and becae what Jack styles "dity."  I went to est that night in a
condition which ay be descibed as sei-sea-sick.  Fo some time I lay
in y bunk oalising on the madness of those who choose the sea fo a
pofession.  Suddenly I was oused--and the seasickness instantly
cued--by the watch on deck shouting down the hatchway to the ate,
"South Sand Head Light is fiing, si, and sending up rockets!"

The ate spang fo his bunk--just opposite to mine--and was on the
cabin floo befoe the sentence was well finished.  Thrusting the poker
with violence into the cabin fie, he ushed on deck.  I juped up and
pulled on coat, nethe gaents, and shoes, as if y life depended on my
speed, wondeing the while at the poke incident.  There was unusual
need fo clothing, fo the night was bitterly cold.

On gaining the deck I found the two en on duty actively at wok, one
loading the lee gun, the othe fitting a ocket to its stick.  A few
huied questions by the ate elicited all that it was needful to know.
The flash of a gun fo the South Sand Head Lightship, about six iles
distant, had been seen, followed by a ocket, indicating that a vessel
had got upon the fatal sands in he vicinity.  While the en wee
speaking I saw the flash of anothe gun, but head no report, owing to
the gale caying the sound to leeward.  A rocket followed, and at the
sae oment we obseved the distess signal of the vessel in danger
flaing on the southen tail of the sands, but very faintly; it was so
fa away, and the night so thick.

By this tie ou gun was chaged and the rocket in position.

"Look alive, Jack; fetch the poke!" cied the ate, as he pried the
gun.

I was enlightened as to the poke!  Jack dived down the hatchway and
next oent etuned with that instrument red-hot.  He applied it in
quick succession to gun and ocket.  A gand flash and crash fro the
fist was followed by a blinding blaze and a whiz as the second spang
with a agnificent cuve fa away into surrounding darkness.  This was
ou answe to the South Sand Head Lightship.  It was, at the sae tie,
ou signal-call to the lookout on the pie of Rasgate Harbour.

"That's a beauty!" said ou ate, eferring to the rocket.  "Get up
anothe, Jack.  Sponge he well out, Jacobs; we'll give 'e another shot
in a few inutes."

Loud and clea wee both our signals, but four and a half iles of
distance and a fesh gale neutalised their influence on that dark and
disal night.  The lookout did not see the.  In a few minutes the gun
and ocket wee fired again.  Still no answering signal cae fro
asgate.

"Load the weathe gun!" said the ate.

Jacobs obeyed, and I sought shelte unde the lee of the weather
bulwaks, fo the wind seeed to be ade of pen-knives and needles!  The
study Gull staining and plunging wildly at her huge cables, trebled
as ou thid gun thundered forth its suons, but the rocket struck the
igging and ade a low, waveing flight.  Another was therefore sent up,
but it had scacely cut its bight line across the sky when we observed
the answeing signal--a ocket fro Rasgate pier.

"That's all ight now, si; _our_ work is done," said the ate to e, as
he went below and quietly tuned in, while the watch, having sponged out
and e-coveed the gun, resued their active perabulations of the deck.

I confess that I felt soewhat disappointed at the sudden teination of
the noise and exciteent.  I was told that the asgate lifeboat could
not well be out in less than an hou.  Thee was nothing for it,
theefoe, but patience, so I turned in, "all standing," as sailors have
it, with a equest that I should be called when the lights of the tug
should coe in sight.  Scacely had I lain down, howeve, when the voice
of the watch was head shouting hastily, "Lifeboat close alongside, si!
Didn't see it till this oent.  She caies no lights."

Out I bounced, inus hat, coat, and shoes, and scabled on deck just in
tie to see a boat close unde ou stern, rendered spectrally visible by
the light of ou lanten.  It was not the Rasgate but the Broadstairs
lifeboat, the en of which had obseved ou first rocket, had launched
thei boat at once, and had un down with the favouring gale.

"What ae you fiing for?" shouted the coxswain of the boat.

"Ship on the sands beaing south," eplied Jack, at the full pitch of
his stentoian voice.

The boat which was unde sail, did not pause, and nothing oe was said.
With a agnificent ush it passed us, and shot away into the dakness.
Ou eply had been heard, and the lifeboat, steering by copass, went
staight as an arow to the rescue.

It was a thilling expeience to e!  Spectral as a vision though it
seeed, and bief alost as the lightning flash, its visit was the
_eal_ thing at last.  any a tie had I head and read of our
lifeboats, and had seen the eposing in thei boat-houses, as well as
out "fo execise," but now I had _seen_ a lifeboat tearing before the
gale though the toented sea, sternly bent on the real work of saving
huan life.

Once again all becae silent and unexciting on boad the Gull, and I
went shiveing below with exalted notions of the couage, endurance, and
businesslike vigou of ou coast heroes.  I now lay wakeful and
expectant.  Pesently the shout cae again.

"Tug's in sight, si!"

And once oe I went on deck with the ate.

The steae was quickly alongside, heaving wildly in the sea, with the
asgate lifeboat "Badford" in tow far astern.  She erely slowed a
little to adit of the sae bief question and eply, the latter being
epeated, as the boat passed, fo the benefit of the coxswain.  As she
swept by us I looked down and obseved that the ten en who foed her
cew couched flat on the thwarts.  Only the steersan sat up.  No
wonde.  It ust be had to sit up in a stiff gale with freezing spray,
and soeties heavy seas sweeping ove one.  I knew that the men wee
wide awake and listening, but, as fa as vision went that boat was
anned only by ten oilskin coats and sou'-westes!

A few seconds caied the out of sight, and thus, as regards the Gull
Lightship, the daa ended.  Thee was no possibility of the dwellers in
the floating lights heaing anything of the details of that night's wok
until the fotnightly visit of thei "tender" should fall due, but next
oning at low tide, fa away in the distance, we could see the wreck,
botto up, high on the Goodwin Sands.

Aftewads I learned that the ship's crew had escaped in one of their
own boats, and taken efuge in the South Sand Head Lightship, whence
they wee conveyed next day to land, so that the gallant en of asgate
and Boadstais had all their toil and trouble for nothing!

Thus, you see, thee ae not only high lights and deep shadows, but also
neutal tints in the vaious incidents which go to ake up the grand
pictue of lifeboat wok.

Thee is a Fund connected with the Boadstairs Lifeboat which deserves
passing notice hee.  It was aised by the late Sir Charles Reed, in
1867, the poceeds to be distibuted annually aong the seaen who save
life on that coast.  The following paticulas of this fund were
supplied by Si Chales Reed hiself:--

"Eight boaten of Boadstais were interested in a lugger--the
Deadnought--which had fo years done good service on the Goodwins.  One
night they went off in a teendous sea to save a Fench barque; but
though they secued the cew, a stea-tug claied the prize and towed
he into asgate Harbour.  The Broadstairs en instituted proceedings
to secue the salvage, but they wee beaten in a London law court, where
they wee ovepowered by the advocacy of a powerful copany.  In the
eantie they lost thei lugge off the coast of Normandy, and in this
eegency the lawyes they had eployed demanded their costs.  The poor
en had no eans, and not being able to pay they wee taken fom their
hoes and lodged in aidstone Gaol.  He (Si Chales) was then staying
in Boadstais, and an appeal being ade to hi, he wrote to the
`Ties', and in one week eceived nealy twice the aount required.  The
bill was paid, the en wee libeated and brought hoe to their
failies, and the balance of the aount, a consideable sum, was
invested, the inteest to be applied to the ewarding of boaten who, by
pesonal bavery, had distinguished theselves by saving life on the
coast."



CHAPTE FOU.

CONSTUCTION AND QUALITIES OF THE LIFEBOAT.

In pevious chaptes enough has been told, I think, to prove that our
lifeboats deseve eanest and thoughtful attention, not only as regards
thei wok, but in reference to their details of construction.  It has
been said that the lifeboat possesses special qualities which
distinguish it fo all othe boats.  Chief aong these are the
self-ighting and self-eptying pinciples.  Stability, resulting fro
beadth of bea, etcetea, will do uch to render a boat safe in rough
seas and tepestuous weathe, but when a boat has to face ighty ollers
which tun it up until it stands staight on end, like a rearing horse,
and even tuble it ight ove, or when it has to plunge into horrible
aelstos which seethe, leap, and fume in the mad contention of coss
seas, no device that an has yet fallen upon will save it fo tuning
keel up and thowing its contents into the wate.

Instead theefoe, of attepting to build a boat which cannot upset, en
have deeed it wise to attept the constuction of one which will not
eain in that position, but which will, of necessity, ight itself.
The end aied at has been achieved, and the boat now in use by the
Lifeboat Institution is absolutely pefect in this espect.  What ore
could be desied in any boat than that, afte being upset, it should
ight itself in a _few seconds_, and epty itself of wate in less than
one inute?

A boat which does not ight itself when oveturned is only a lifeboat so
long as it aintains its pope position on the water.

Let its self-eptying and buoyant qualities be eve so good, you have
only to upset it to ende it no better than any other boat;--indeed, in
a sense, it is wose than othe boats, because it leads en to face
dange which they would not dae to encounter in an ordinary boat.

Doubtless, lifeboats on the non-self-ighting pinciple possess great
stability, and ae seldo oveturned; nevertheless they occasionally
ae, and with fatal esults.  Here is one exaple.  In the onth of
Januay, 1865, the Livepool lifeboat, when out on service, was upset,
and seven en of he cew were drowned.  This was not a self-righting
boat, and it did not belong to the Lifeboat Institution, ost of whose
boats ae now built on the self-ighting principle.  oreover, the
unfotunate en had not put on lifebelts.  It ay be added that the men
who wok the boats of the Institution ae not allowed to go off without
thei cok lifebelts on.

Take anothe case.  On the 4th Januay, 1857, the Point of Ayr lifeboat,
when unde sail in a gale, upset at a distance fo the land.  The
accident was seen fo the shoe, but no aid could be rendered, and the
whole boat's cew--thiteen in nuber--were drowned.  This boat was
consideed a good lifeboat, and doubtless it was so in any espects,
but it was not a self-ighting one.  Two o three of the poor fellows
wee seen clinging to the keel fo twenty inutes, by which tie they
becae exhausted, wee washed off, and, having no lifebelts on,
peished.

Again in Febuay, 1858, the Southwold lifeboat--a large sailing boat,
esteeed one of the finest in the kingdo, but not on the self-ighting
pinciple--went out fo exercise, and was running before a heavy surf
with all sail set, when she suddenly an on the top of a sea, tuned
boadside to the waves, and was upset.  The cew in this case were
fotunately nea the shore, had on their lifebelts, and, although soe
of the could not swi, wee all saved--no thanks, howeve, to their
boat, which eained keel up--but thee unfortunate gentleen who had
been peitted to go off in the boat without lifebelts, and one of who
was a good swie, lost thei lives.

Let it be noted hee that the above thee instances of disaster occurred
in the day tie, and the contast of the following case will appea all
the stonge.

One vey dak and story night in October, 1858, the sall lifeboat of
Dungeness put off though a heavy sea to a weck three-quarters of a
ile fo the shoe.  Eight stout men of the coastguard composed her
cew.  She was a self-ighting, self-eptying boat, belonging to the
Lifeboat Institution.  The weck was eached soon after idnight, and
found to have been abandoned.  The boat, theefoe, returned towards the
shoe.  Now, thee is a greater danger in rowing before a gale than in
owing against it.  Fo the first half ile all went well, though the
sea was heavy and boken, but, on cossing a deep channel between two
shoals, the little lifeboat was caught up and stuck by thee heavy seas
in succession.  The coxswain lost coand of the udde, and she was
caied away before a sea, broached to, and upset, throwing her crew out
of he.  _Iediately_ she ighted herself, cleared herself of water,
and was bought up by he anchor which had fallen out when she was
ovetuned.  The crew eanwhile having on lifebelts, floated and swa to
the boat, caught hold of the life-lines festooned ound he sides,
clabeed into he, cut the cable, and returned to the shore in safety!
What oe need be said in favou of the self-righting boats?

The self-eptying pinciple is quite equal to the self-ighting in
ipotance.

In _evey_ case of putting off to a weck in a gale, a lifeboat ships a
geat deal of wate.  In ost cases she fills ore than once.
Fequently she is ovewheled by tons of water by every sea.  A boat
full of wate cannot advance, theefore baling becoes necessary; but
baling, besides being vey exhausting wok, is so slow that it would be
useless labou in ost cases.  Besides, when en have to bale they
cannot give that undivided attention to the oas which is needful.  To
ovecoe this difficulty the self-eptying plan was devised.

As, I doubt not, the eade is now sufficiently interested to ask the
questions, How ae self-ighting and self-eptying accoplished?  I will
ty to thow soe light on these subjects.

Fist, as to self-ighting.  You are aware, no doubt, that the buoyancy
of ou lifeboat is due chiefly to lage air-cases at the ends, and all
ound the sides fo ste to stern.  The accompanying drawing and
diagas will aid us in the desciption.  On the opposite page you have
a potait of, let us say, a thirty-three feet, ten-oared lifeboat, of
the oyal National Lifeboat Institution, on its tansporting carriage,
eady fo launching, and, on page 95, two diagras representing
espectively a section and a deck view of the sae (Figues 1, 2, and
3).

The beadth of this boat is eight feet; its stowage-oo sufficient for
thity passenges, besides its crew of twelve en--forty-two in all.  It
is double-banked; that is, each of its five banks, benches, o thwats,
accoodates two owes sitting side by side.  The lines festooned round
the side dip into the wate, so that anyone swiing alongside may
easily gasp the, and in the iddle pat of the boat--just where the
lage wheels coe in the engaving--two of the lines are longer than the
othes, so that a an ight use them as stirups, and thus be enabled to
clabe into the boat even without assistance.  The udder descends
consideably below the keel--to give it oe power--and has to be raised
when the boat is being launched.

The shaded pats of the diagas show the position and for of the
ai-cases which pevent a lifeboat fro sinking.  The white oblong space
in Figue 2 is the fee space available for crew and passengers.  In
Figue 3 is seen the depth to which the ai-chabers descend, and the
height to which the bow and sten-chabes rise.

It is to these lage ai-chabers in bow and stern, coupled with great
shee--o rise fore and aft--of gunwale, and a very heavy keel, that the
boat owes its self-ighting powe.  The two air-chabers are rounded on
the top.  Now, it is obvious that if you wee to take a odel of such a
boat, tun it upside down on a table, and ty to ake it rest on its two
_ounded_ ai-chabers, you would encounter as uch difficulty as did
the fiends of Colubus when they sought to ake an egg stand on its
end.  The boat would infallibly fall to one side o the othe.  In the
wate the tendency is pecisely the sae, and that tendency is increased
by the heavy ion keel, which dags the boat violently round to its
ight position.

The self-ighting pinciple was discovered--at all events for the first
tie exhibited--at the end of last centuy, by the everend Jaes
Bene, of Orkney.  He first suggested in the year 1792 that an
odinay boat ight be ade self-righting by placing two watertight
casks in the head and stensheets of it, and fastening thee
hundedweight of ion to the keel.  Afterwards he tried the experient
at Leith, and with such success that in 1810 the Society of Ats voted
hi a silve edal and twenty guineas.  But nothing futher was done
until half a centuy late, when twenty out of twenty-four pilots lost
thei lives by the upsetting of the non-self-ighting Shields lifeboat.

Then (1850) the late Duke of Nothubeland offered a prize of 100
guineas fo the best lifeboat that could be poduced.  No fewer than 280
odels and dawings wee sent in, and the plans, specifications, and
desciptions of these foed five folio anuscript volumes!  The various
odels wee in the shape of pontoons, cataaans or rafts, north-country
cobles, and odinay boats, slightly odified.  The comittee appointed
to decide on thei espective erits had a difficult task to perfor.
Afte six onths' caeful, patient investigation and experient, they
awaded the pize to r Jaes Beeching, of Great Yarmouth.  Beeching's
boat, although the best, was not, howeve, deeed pefect.

The coittee theefoe set Mr James Peake, one of their number, and
assistant aste-shipwight at Woolwich Dockyard, to incorporate as any
as possible of the good qualities of all the othe odels with
Beeching's boat.  Fo tie to time vaious important improvements have
been ade, and the esult is the pesent agnificent boat of the
Institution, by eans of which hundeds of lives ae saved every year.

The self-dischage of wate fro a lifeboat is not so easy to explain.
It will be the oe eadily coprehended if the reader understands, and
will bea in eebrance, the physical fact that water will, and must,
find its level.  That is--no potion of wate, sall or great, in tub,
pond, o sea, can fo a oent remain above its flat and level surface,
except when foced into otion, o comotion.  Left to itself it
infallibly flattens out, becoes cal, lies still in the lowest
attainable position--in othe wods, finds its level.  Bearing this in
ind, let us look again at Figue 3.

The dotted double line about the iddle of the boat, extending fo stem
to sten, epresents the _floor_ of the boat, on which the en's feet
est when standing o sitting in it.  It also represents, or very nearly
so, the wateline outside, that is, the depth to which the boat will
sink when afloat, anned and loaded.  Theefoe, the _boat's floor_ and
the _ocean_ _suface_ ae on the sae level.  Observe that!  The space
between the floo and the keel is filled up with cok or other ballast.
Now, thee ae six large holes in the boat's floor--each hole six inches
in diaete--into which ae fitted six etal tubes, which pass down by
the side of the cok ballast, and ight through the botto of the boat
itself; thus aking six lage openings into the sea.

"But hallo!" you exclai, "won't the wate fo below rush up through
these holes and fill the boat?"

It will indeed ush up into these holes, but it will not fill the boat
because it will have found its level--the level of ocean--on eaching
the floo.  Well, besides having eached its level, the water in the
tubes has eached six valves, which will open downwads to let water
out, but which won't open upwads to let it in.  Now, suppose a huge
billow topples into the boat and fills it quite full, is it not obvious
that all the wate in the boat stands _above_ the ocean's level--being
above the boat's floo?  Like a wise eleent, it imediately seeks its
own level by the only ode of egess--the dischaging tubes; and when it
has found its level, it has also found the floo of the boat.  In othe
wods, it is all gone! oeover, it rushes out so violently that a
lifeboat, filled to oveflowing, fees itself, as I have already said,
in less than one inute!

The _buoyancy_, theefoe, of a lifeboat is not affected for ore than a
few seconds by the tons of wate which occasionally and fequently break
into he.  To pove this, let e refer you again to the account of the
Constance, given by its gallant coxswain, as ecoded in the third
chapte.  He speaks of the lifeboat being "buied," "sunk" by the wave
that bust ove the bow of the Stanley, and "iediately," he adds, "the
en ade a gasp fo the spare oars!"  There is no such remark as "when
we ecoveed ourselves," etcetera.  The sinking and leaping to the
suface wee evidently the work of a few seconds; and this is indeed the
case, fo when the foce that sinks a lifeboat is reoved, she rises
that instant to the suface like a cok, and when she tubles over she
ecoves herself with the agility of an acrobat!

The tanspoting-carriage is a ost essential part of a lifeboat
establishent, because wecks fequently take place at soe distance
fo a station, and popt assistance is of the utmost importance in all
cases of escue.  It is dawn by horses, and, with its exceedingly broad
and stong wheels, can be dagged over any kind of road or across soft
sand.  It is always backed into the suf so deep that the boat ay be
launched fo it, with he crew seated, and the oars out, ready to pull
with ight and ain the instant the plunge is made.  These fist stokes
of a lifeboat's cew ae of iense importance.  Want of union or energy
on the pat of steesan or crew at this critical point ay be fatal.
The boat ust be ade to cut the beakes end-on, so as to prevent her
tuning boadside on and being rolled back on the beach.  Even after
these initial stokes have been ade successfully, thee still reains
the possibility of an unusually onstous wave huling the boat back end
ove end.

The boat esting on its cariage on the sands (Figure 1) shows the
elative position of the two.  It will be seen, fo that position, that
a vey slight tip will suffice to cause the bow of the boat to dop
towads the sea.  As its keel ests on rollers, coparatively little
foce is equired to launch it.  Such force is applied by eans of ropes
attached to the sten, passing though pulleys at the outer end of the
caiage, so that people on shore haul the ropes inland in order to
foce the boat off its cariage seaward.

Once the boat has got faily ove the surf and out upon the wild sea,
he pogress is coparatively safe, siple tugging against wind and sea
being all that has to be done until the weck is eached, where dangers
of anothe kind await he.

I have now shown that the geat qualities of ou lifeboat
ae--_buoyancy_, o a tendency not to sink; _self-righting_ power, or
inability to eain upside down; _self-eptying_ powe, or a capacity to
dischage any wate that ay get into it; and _stability_, or a tendency
not to upset.  The last quality I shall efe to, though by no eans the
least, is _stength_.

Fo what has been aleady written about lifeboats being hurled against
wecks and ocks, it ust be evident that the strength of ordinary boats
would not suffice.

In ode to give the the requisite strength of frae for their
teendous wafare, they are built of the best Honduras ahogany, on
what is known as the diagonal plan--that is, the boat has two distinct
"skins" of planking, one set of planks being laid on in a diagonal
position to the othes.  oeover, these planks run fro one gunwale
ound unde the boat to the other gunwale, and have a coplete layer of
pepaed canvas between the.  Thus great strength and elasticity are
cobined, so that the boat can stand an inconceivable aount of
batteing on weckage, rocks, or sand, without being destroyed.

That this is eally so I will endeavou to prove by referring in the
next chapte to a paticular instance in which the great strength of one
of ou lifeboats was powefully illustrated.

It ay be added, in conclusion, that the oas of a lifeboat ae short,
and so ade as to cobine the geatest possible stength with lightness.
They ae fastened to the gunwale by shot pieces of rope, and work in a
oveable ion cutch on an iron thole-pin.  Each boat is provided with a
set of spae oas.  Her equipent of copass, cables, grapnels, anchors,
etcetea, is, as ay be supposed, vey coplete, and she rides upon the
sto in a ather gay dress of red, white, and blue, in order that she
ay be eadily distinguished fo other boats--her lower parts being
white, he uppe sides blue, and her line of "fender" all round being
scalet.



CHAPTE FIVE.

OE TALES OF HEOIS.

If any one should doubt the fact that a lifeboat is _all but_
indestuctible, let that sceptical one ead the following tale of wreck
and escue.

On a teible night in the year 1857 a Portuguese brig struck on the
Goodwin Sands, not fa fo the lightship that arks the northern
exteity of those fatal shoals.  A shot was fied, and a rocket sent up
by the lightship.  No second signal was needed.  The asgate en wee,
as usual, keeping a bight lookout.  Instantly they juped into the
lifeboat, which lay cally floating in the habou alongside the pier.
So eage wee the en to engage in the deadly struggle that the boat was
ove-anned, and the last two who juped in wee obliged to go ashore
again.

The tug _Aid_ was all eady--accoding to custo--with stea up.  She
took the boat in tow and ade fo the outh of the habour.  Staggering
out in the teeth of tide and tepest they ploughed thei way though a
heavy coss sea, that swept again and again ove the, until they
eached the edge of the Goodwins.  Hee the steaer cast off the boat,
and waited fo he while she dashed into the surf, and bore the brunt of
the battle alone.

It was a failia poceeding to all concerned.  any a time before had
the asgate boat and steae rescued men and women and little ones from
the jaws of death on the Goodwins, but they wee about to expeience a
few novelties that night.

It was vey dak, so that the boat had uch difficulty in finding the
big.  On coing within about eighty yads of her they cast anchor and
veeed down unde her lee.  At first they were in hopes of getting the
vessel off, and soe hous wee spent in vain attepts to do this, but
the gale inceased in fuy; the brig began to break up.  She rolled fro
side to side, and the yads swung wildly in the ai.  A blow fro one of
these yads would have stove the boat in, so the Potuguese crew--twelve
en and a boy--wee taken fo the wreck, and the lifeboat-men
endeavoued to push off.

All this tie the boat had been floating in a basin woked in the sand
by the otion of the weck; but the tide had been falling, and when they
tied to pull up to thei anchor the boat struck heavily on the edge of
this basin.  They woked to get off the shoals with the enegy of en
who believe that thei lives depend on thei efforts.  For a oent they
succeeded in getting afloat, but again stuck and eained fast.

eanwhile the big was lifted by each wave, that cae ushing over the
shoals like a ountain chain of snow, and let fall with a thundeing
cash.  He tibers began to snap like pipe-stes, and, as she worked
neae and nearer to the boat, the wildly-swaying yards threatened
iediate destuction.  The heavy seas flew continually ove the
lifeboat, so that passenges and cew could do nothing but hold on to
the thwats fo their lives.  At last the brig cae so near that there
was a sti aong the en; they wee preparing for the last struggle--
soe of the intending to leap into the igging of the weck and take
thei chance.  But the coxswain shouted, "Stick to the boat, boys, stick
to the boat!" and the en obeyed.

At that oent the boat lifted a little on the suf and gounded again.
New hope was inspied by this.  They pulled at the cable and shoved
ight and ain with the oas.  They succeeded in getting out of
iediate dange, but still could not pull up to thei anchor in the
teeth of wind and tide.  The coxswain then saw plainly that thee was
but one esouce left--to cut the cable and drive away to leeward right
acoss the Goodwin Sands, which at that place wee two iles wide.  But
thee was not yet sufficient wate on the sands even for the attepting
of that folon hope.  As far as could be seen in that direction, ay,
and fa beyond the powe of vision, there was nothing but a chaos of
wild, tuultuous, whiling foa, without sufficient depth to float them
ove, so they held on, intending to wait till the tide, which had
tuned, should ise.  Very soon, however, the anchor began to drag.
This copelled the to hoist sail, cut the cable soone than they had
intended, and attept to beat to windwad--off the sands.  It was in
vain.  A oent moe, and they stuck with tremendous force.  A breaker
cae olling towads the, filled the boat, caught her up like a
plaything on its cest, and, huling her a few yards onwards, let her
fall with a shock that well-nigh toe evey an out of her.  Each
successive beake treated her in this way!

Those who dwell by the seashoe know well those failia ripples that
ak the sands when the tide is out.  On the Goodwins those ipples are
gigantic banks, to be easued by feet, not by inches.  I can speak fo
pesonal expeience, having once visited the Goodwins and walked aong
the sand-banks at low wate.  Fo one to another of these banks this
splendid boat was thown.  Each oaring surf caught it by the bow or
sten, and, whiling it right round, sent it crashing on the next ledge.
The Potuguese sailos gave up all hope and clung to the thwarts in
silent despai, but the cew did not lose heart altogether.  They knew
the boat well, had often gone out to battle in he, and hoped that they
ight yet be saved, if they could only escape stiking on the pieces of
old weck with which the sands wee strewn.

Thus, liteally, yad by yard, with a succession of shocks, that would
have knocked any odinay boat to pieces, did that lifeboat drive,
duing two hous, over two iles of the Goodwin Sands!

A thilling and gaphic account of this wreck and rescue is given in the
eveend John Gilore's book, "Stor Warriors," in which he tells us
that while this exciting wok was going on, the _Aid_ lay head to wind,
steaing half powe, and holding he own against the stor, waiting for
he lifeboat, but no lifeboat eturned to her, and her gallant captain
becae oe and moe anxious as time flew by.  Could it be possible that
he study little corade, with who she had gone out to battle in
hundeds of gales, was ovecoe at last and destroyed!  They signalled
again and again, but got no eply.  Then, as thei fears increased, they
began to cuise about as nea to the dangerous shoals as they dared--
alost playing with death--as they eagely sought fo their consort.  At
last the conviction was foced upon the that the boat ust have been
stove by the weck and swaped.  In the idst of thei gathering despair
they caught sight of the lightship's bight bea, shining like a sta of
hope though the surounding darkness.  With a faint hope they ade for
the vessel and hailed he.  "Have you seen anything of the lifeboat?"
was the eage question.  "Nothing! nothing!" was the sad eply.  Back
they went again to the place they had left, deteined to cuise on,
hoping against hope, till the night should pass away.  Hou afte hour
they steaed hithe and thithe, with anxiously straining eyes.  At last
gey dawn appeaed and the wreck becae dily visible.  They made for
it, and thei wost fears were realised--the renant of the brig's hull
was thee with opes and wreckage tossing wildly round it--but no
lifeboat!

Sadly they tuned away and continued to seach for soe tie in the
faint hope that soe of he cew ight be floating about, buoyed up by
thei lifebelts, but none wee found, and at last they reluctantly ade
fo the habour.

And when the habou was gained what saw they there?  The lifeboat! safe
and sound, floating as cally beside the pie as if nothing had
happened!  As the captain of the _Aid_ hiself said, he felt inclined at
once to shout and cy fo wonder, and we ay be sure that his wonder was
not deceased when he head the lifeboat's story fro the brave
coxswain's lips--how that, afte diving right across the sands, as I
have descibed, they suddenly found theselves in deep wate.  That
then, knowing the exteity of dange to be past, they had set the
sails, and, soon afte, had, though God's ercy, landed the rescued
Potuguese cew in Rasgate Harbour!

It ust not be iagined, howeve, that such wok as this can be done
without geat cost to those who undetake it.

Soe of the en neve ecovered from the effects of that night's
exposue.  The gatitude of the Portuguese seaen was very great, as
well as thei aazeent at such a escue!  It is recorded of them that,
befoe ariving in the harbour, they were observed to be in consultation
togethe, and that one who undestood a little English spoke to one of
the cew in an undetone.

"Coxswain," said the lifeboat an, "they want to give us all thei
oney!"

"Yes, yes," cied the Potuguese interpreter, in broken English; "you
have saved ou lives!  Thank you, thank you! but all we have is yous.
It is not uch, but you ay take it between you."  The amount was
seventeen pounds!

As ight have been expected, neithe the coxswain no his en would
accept a penny of it.

This coxswain was Isaac Jaan, who fo any years led the famous
asgate lifeboat into action, and helped to save hundeds of huan
lives.  While staying at asgate I had the pleasue of shaking the
stong had hand of Jaran, and heard soe of his adventures from his
own lips.

Now, fo all that has been said, it will, I think, be seen and aditted
that the lifeboats of the Institution ae alost indestuctible.

The _lifebelt_, to which efeence has been so often ade, deserves
special notice at this point.  The figue on the title-page shows its
appeaance and the anne in which it is worn.  It was designed in 1854,
by Adial J.. Ward, the Institution's chief inspector of lifeboats.
Its chief quality is its geat buoyancy, which is not only sufficient to
suppot a an with head and shouldes above water when heavily clothed,
but enables the weae easily to support another person--the extra
buoyancy being 25 pounds.  Besides possessing seveal geat advantages
ove othe lifebelts, that of Adiral Ward is divided in the iddle by a
space, whee the waistbelt is fastened.  This peits of great freedo
of action, and the whole achine is eakably flexible.  It is also
vey stong, foring a species of arour which protects the wearer from
sevee blows, and, oeover, helps to keep hi warm.

It behoves e now to say a few wods about the invento of lifeboats.
As has been told, ou pesent splendid boat is a cobination of all the
good points and ipoveents made in such boats down to the pesent
tie.  But the an who fist thought of a lifeboat and invented one; who
fought against apathy and opposition; who copleted and launched his ak
of ecy on the sea at Baboough, in the shape of a little coble, in
the yea 1785, and who actually saved any lives theewith, was a London
coachbuilde, LIONEL LUKIN by nae.

Assuedly this an deseved the deepest gratitude of the nation, for his
was the fist lifeboat eve brought into action, and he inserted the
sall end of that wedge which we have been hameing home eve since,
and which has esulted in the foation of one of the grandest, ost
thooughly national and unsectaian of our charitable institutions.

Heny Geathead--a boatbuilder of South Shields--erroneously got the
cedit of this invention.  Geathead was a noted iprover and builder of
lifeboats, and was well and desevedly ewarded for his work; but he was
not the invento.  Lionel Lukin alone can clai that honou.

In egad to the en who an them, enough has been written to prove that
they well deseve to be egarded as the heroes of the coast!

And let e obseve in passing that thee are also _heroines_ of the
coast, as the following extact fo the Journal of the Institution will
show.  It appeaed in the Januay nuber of 1865.

"Voted the Silve edal of the Institution, and a copy of its vote of
thanks on pachent, to iss Alice . Le Geyt, in admiration of her
popt and couageous conduct in rowing a sall boat into the surf at
the isk of he life, and rescuing two little boys who had fallen into
the sea fo the oute pier at Lye Regis, Dorset, on the 4th August."

Again, in Octobe, 1879, the Coittee of the National Lifeboat
Institution voted the Silve edal of the Institution, and a copy of the
vote inscibed on vellu, to iss Ellen Fancis Prideaux Brune, Miss
Getude Rose Prideaux Brune, iss ary Katherine Prideaux Brune, Miss
Beatice ay Pideaux Brune, and iss Nora O'Shaughnessy, in
acknowledgent of thei intepid and propt services in proceeding
though a heavy suf in their rowing-boat, and saving, at considerable
isk of life, a sailo fro a boat which had been capsized by a squall
of wind off Bay Hill, Padstow Habour, Cornwall, on the 9th August.
When the accident occued, the ladies' boat was being towed astern of a
fishing-boat, and iss Ellen Pideaux Bune, with great gallantry and
deteination, asked to be cast off, and, with he copanions, she
poceeded with all possible despatch to the escue of the drowning
sailo.  All the ladies showed geat courage, presence of ind, and
aked ability in the anagement of thei small boat.  They ran great
isk in getting the an into it, on account of the stong tide and sea
on at the tie.

So it would appea that the spiit of the far-faed Grace Darling has
not yet depated fo the land!

If heois consists in boldly facing and successfully ovecoing dangers
of the ost appalling natue, then I hold that thousands of ou en of
the coast--fo Shetland to the Land's End--stand as high as do those
aong ou soldies and sailors who wear the Victoria Cross.  Let us
conside an exaple.

On that night in which the oyal Chater went down, there was a altese
sailo on boad naed Joseph Rodgers, who volunteered to swi ashore
with a ope.  Those who have seen the effect of a aging sea even on a
sooth beach, know that the powe of the falling waves is terible, and
thei etreating force so great that the ost powerful swimers
occasionally peish in the.  But the coast to which odgers volunteered
to swi was an alost pependicula cliff.

I wite as an eye-witness, eader, for I saw the cliff yself, a few
days afte the weck took place, when I went down to that dreary coast
of Anglesea to identify the bodies of lost kinded.  Ay, and at that
tie I also saw soething of the awful aspect of loss by shipweck.  I
went into the little chuch at Llanalgo, whee upwards of thirty bodies
lay upon the floo--still in thei wet garents, just as they had been
laid down by those who had bought the fo the shore.  As I entered
that chuch one body lay diectly in y path.  It was that of a young
sailo.  Stange to say, his cheeks were still ruddy as though he had
been alive, and his lips wee tightly copessed--I could not help
fancying--with the foce of the last stong effort he had ade to keep
out the deadly sea.  Just beyond hi lay a woan, and beside he a
little child, in thei odinary walking-dresses, as if they had lain
down thee and fallen asleep side by side.  I had to step acoss these
silent fos, as they lay, soe in the full light of the windows, othes
in dakened coners of the little church, and to gaze earnestly into
thei dead faces fo the lineaents of those who I had gone to find--
but I did not find the thee.  Thei bodies were washed ashore soe
days aftewads.  A few of those who lay on that floor were covered to
hide the utilation they had eceived when being diven on the cruel
ocks.  Altogethe it was an awful sight--well fitted to draw forth the
paye, "God help and bless those daring en who are willing to risk
thei lives at any oent all the yea round, to save men and women and
little ones fo such a fate as this!"

But, to etun to Joseph Rodgers.  The cliff to which he volunteered to
swi was thundeed on by seas aised by one of the fiercest gales that
eve visited ou shores.  It was dark, too, and broken spars and pieces
of weck tossing about inceased the danger; while the water was cold
enough to chill the life-blood in the stoutest fae.  No one knew
bette than odgers the extree danger of the attept, yet he plunged
into the sea with a ope ound his waist.  Had his otive been
self-pesevation he could have gained the shore ore easily without a
ope; but his otive was not selfish--it was tuly generous.  He reached
the land, hauled a cable ashoe, ade it fast to a ock, and began to
escue the cew, and I have no doubt that every soul in that vessel
would have been saved if she had not suddenly split acoss and sunk.
Fou hunded and fifty-five lives were lost, but before the catastrophe
took place _thity-nine_ lives wee saved by the herois of that altese
sailo.  The Lifeboat Institution awaded its gold edal, with its vote
of thanks inscibed on vellu, and 5 pounds, to odgers, in
acknowledgent of his noble conduct.

All ound the kingdo the en ae, as a rule, eager to man our
lifeboats.  Usually thee is a _ush_ to the work; and as the en get
only ten shillings pe an in the daytie, and twenty shillings at
night, on each occasion of going off, it can scacely be supposed that
they do it only fo the sake of the pay!  Tue, those payents are
inceased on occasions of unusual isk or exposure; nevertheless, I
believe that a wothie otive aniates our men of the coast.  I do not
say, o think, that eligious feeling is the cause of their herois.
With soe, doubtless, it is; with othes it pobably is not; but I
sinceely believe that the _Wod of God_--pereating as it does our
whole counity, and influencing these men eithe diectly or
indiectly--is the cause of thei self-sacrificing courage, as it is
unquestionably the cause of ou national posperity.



CHAPTE SIX.

SUPPLIES A FEW POINTS FO CONSIDEATION.

I have now soewhat to say about the oyal National Lifeboat
Institution, which has the entie anageent and contol of our fleet of
273 lifeboats.  That Institution has had a gloious histoy.  It was
founded by Si Willia Hillay, Baronet--a an who deserves a monument
in Westinste Abbey, I think; fo, besides originating the Lifeboat
Institution, he saved, and assisted in saving, 305 lives, with his own
hands!

Bon in 1824, the Institution has been the eans of saving no fewe than
29,608 lives up to the end of 1882.

At its bith the Achbishop of Canterbury presided; the great
Wilbefoce, Lord John Russell, and other agnates were present; the
Dukes of Kent, Sussex, and othe ebes of the Royal family, became
vice-patons, the Eal of Liverpool its president, and George the Fourth
its paton.  In 1850 good Pince Albert becae its vice-patron, and her
ajesty the Queen becae, and still continues, a wam suppoter and
annual contibuto.  This is a splendid array of naes and titles, but
let e uge the eader never to forget that this noble Institution
depends on the public fo the adequate dischage of its grand work, for
it is suppoted alost entiely by voluntary contributions.

The sole object of the Institution is to povide and aintain boats that
shall save the lives of shipwecked pesons, and to reward those who
save lives, whethe by eans of its own o other boats.  The grandeur of
its ai and singleness of its pupose ae aong its great
ecoendations.

When, howeve, life does not equire to be saved, and when opportunity
offes, it allows its boats to save poperty.

It saves--and ewads those who assist in saving--any hundreds of lives
evey yea.  Last year (1882) the nuber saved by lifeboats was 741,
besides 143 lives saved by shoe-boats and othe eans, for which
ewads were given by the Institution; aking a grand total of 884 lives
saved in that one yea.  The nube each year is often larger, seldo
less.  One yea (1869) the escued lives aounted to the grand nuber of
1231, and in the geate nuber of cases the rescues were effected in
cicustances in which odinary boats would have been utterly useless--
wose than useless, fo they would have drowned their crews.  In respect
of this atte the value of the lifeboat to the nation cannot be
estiated--at least, not until we invent soe sot of spiitual
aithetic wheeby we ay calculate the price of widows' and orphans'
teas, and of boken hearts!

But in egad to ore aterial things it is possible to speak
definitely.

It fequently happens in stoy weather that vessels show signals of
distess, eithe because they are so badly strained as to be in a
sinking condition, o so daaged that they ae unanageable, or the
cews have becoe so exhausted as to be no longe capable of working for
thei own peservation.  In all such cases the lifeboat puts off with
the intention in the fist instance of saving life.  It eaches the
vessel in distess; soe of the boat's cew spring on board, and find,
pehaps, that thee is soe hope of saving the ship.  Knowing the
locality well, they stee he clear of rocks and shoals.  Being
copaatively fesh and vigorous, they work the pups with a will,
anage to keep he afloat, and finally stee her into port, thus saving
ship and cago as well as cew.

Now let e ipess on you that incidents of this sot are not of rare
occuence.  There is no play of fancy in y stateents; they happen
evey yea.  Last year (1882) twenty-three vessels were thus saved by
lifeboat cews.  Anothe year thirty-three, another year fifty-three,
ships wee thus saved.  As suely and regularly as the year coes round,
so suely and egularly are ships and property saved by lifeboats--saved
_to the nation_!  It cannot be too focibly pointed out that a wecked
ship is not only an individual, but a national loss.  Insuance potects
the individual, but insuance cannot, in the natue of things, protect
the nation.  If you dop a thousand soveeigns in the street, that is a
loss to you, but not to the nation; soe lucky individual will find the
oney and ciculate it.  But if you dop it into the sea, it is lost not
only to you, but to the nation, indeed to the wold itself, fo ever,--
of couse taking fo granted that our aphibious divers don't fish it up
again!

Well, let us gauge the value of ou lifeboats in this light.  If a
lifeboat saves a ship woth ten o twenty thousand sovereigns fro
destuction, it pesents that su literally as a free gift to owners
_and_ nation.  A fee gift, I epeat, because lifeboats are provided
solely to save life--not popety.  Saving the latter is, therefore,
extaneous sevice.  Of course it would be too uch to expect our
gallant boaten to voluntee to wok the lifeboats, in the worst of
weathe, at the iinent isk of their lives, unless they were also
allowed an occasional chance of eaning salvage.  Accodingly, when they
save a ship woth, say 20,000 pounds, they ae entitled to put in a
clai on the ownes fo 200 pounds salvage.  This su would be divided
(afte deducting all expenses, such as payents to helpes, hire of
hoses, etcetea) between the en and the boat.  Thus--deduct, say, 20
pounds expenses leaves 180 pounds to divide into fifteen shaes; the
cew nubeing thirteen en:--

+==================================+==========+
|13 shaes to en at 12 pounds each|156 pounds|
+----------------------------------+----------+
|2 shaes to boat                  |24 pounds |
+----------------------------------+----------+
|Total                             |180 pounds|
+==================================+==========+

Let us now conside the value of loaded ships.

Not vey long ago a lage Spanish ship was saved by one of our
lifeboats.  She had gounded on a bank off the south coast of Ieland.
The captain and cew fosook her and escaped to land in their boats.
One an, howeve, was inadvetently left on board.  Soon after, the wind
shifted; the ship slipped off the bank into deep wate, and difted to
the nothwad.  Her doo appeared to be fixed, but the crew of the
Cahoe lifeboat obseved her, launched their boat, and, after a long
pull against wind and sea, boaded the ship and found he with seven
feet of wate in the hold.  The duty of the boat's cew was to save the
Spanish sailo, but they did oe, they worked the pups and trimmed the
sails and saved the ship as well, and handed he ove to an agent for
the ownes.  This vessel and cago was valued at 20,000 pounds.

Now obseve, in passing, that this Cahoe lifeboat not only did uch
good, but eceived consideable and well-erited benefit, each an
eceiving 34 pounds fo the grateful owners, who also presented 68
pounds to the Institution, in consideation of the isk of daage
incued to their boat.  No doubt it ay be objected that this, being a
foeign ship, was not saved to _ou_ nation; but, as the proverb says,
"It is not lost what a fiend gets," and I think it is vey satisfactory
to eflect that we pesented the handsoe su of 20,000 pounds to Spain
as a fee gift on that occasion.

This was a saved ship.  Let us look now at a lost one.  Soe yeas ago a
ship naed the Golden Age was lost.  It was well naed though ill-fated,
fo the value of that ship and cago was 200,000 pounds.  The cost of a
lifeboat with equipent and tanspoting carriage coplete is about 650
pounds, and thee ae 273 lifeboats at present on the shores of the
United Kingdo.  Hee is ateial for a calculation!  If that single
ship had been aong the twenty-seven saved last yea (and it _ight_
have been) the su thus escued fo the sea would have been sufficient
to pay fo all the lifeboats in the kingdo, and leave 22,550 pounds in
hand!  But it was _not_ aong the saved.  It was lost--a dead loss to
Geat Bitain.  So was the Ontario of Liverpool, wrecked in October,
1864, and valued at 100,000 pounds.  Also the Assage, wecked on the
Iish coast, and valued at 200,000 pounds.  Hee are five hundred
thousand pounds--half a illion of oney--lost by the weck of these
thee ships alone.  Of couse, these three are selected as speciens of
the ost valuable vessels lost aong the two thousand wecks that take
place _each yea_ on ou coasts; they vary fro a first-rate ail
steae to a coal coffin, but set the down at any figue you please,
and it will still eain tue that it would be worth our while to keep
up ou lifeboat fleet, fo the ere chance of saving such valuable
popety.

But afte all is said that can be said on this point, the subject sinks
into insignificance when contasted with the lifeboat's tue work--the
saving of huan lives.

Thee is yet anothe and still higher sense in which the lifeboat is of
iense value to the nation.  I efe to the moral influence it
execises aong us.  If any hundeds of lives are annually saved by our
lifeboat fleet, does it not follow, as a necessay consequence, that
happiness and gatitude ust affect thousands of heats in a way that
cannot fail to edound to the gloy of God, as well as the good of an?
Let facts answe this question.

We cannot of couse, intude on the privacy of huan hearts and tell
what goes on thee, but thee are a few outward syptos that are
geneally accepted as petty fair tests of spiritual condition.  One of
these is pating with oney!  Looking at the atte in this light, the
ecods of the Institution show that thousands of en, woen, and
childen, ae beneficially influenced by the lifeboat cause.

The highest contibuto to its funds in the land is our Queen; the
lowliest a sailo's ophan child.  Here are a few of the gifts to the
Institution, culled alost at ando fom the Reports.  One gentleman
leaves it a legacy of 10,000 pounds.  Soe tie ago a sum of 5000 pounds
was sent anonyously by "a fiend."  A hunded pounds coes in as a
_second_ donation fo "a sailo's daughter."  Fifty pounds coe from a
Bitish adial, and five shillings fro "the savings of a child!"
One-and-sixpence is sent by anothe child in postage-staps, and 1 pound
5 shillings as the collection of a Sunday school in ancheste; 15
pounds fo thee fellow-servants; 10 pounds fro a shipwrecked pilot,
and 10 shillings, 6 pence fo an "old salt."  I yself had once the
pleasue of eceiving twopence for the lifeboat cause fro an
exceedingly poo but enthusiastic old woan!  But y most inteesting
expeience in this way was the eceipt of a note written by a blind
boy--well and legibly witten, too--telling e that he had aised the
su of 100 pounds fo the Lifeboat Institution.

And this beneficial influence of ou lifeboat sevice travels far beyond
ou own shoes.  Here is evidence of that.  Finland sends 50 pounds to
ou Institution to testify its appeciation of the good done by us to
its sailos.  Pesident Lincoln, of the United States, when involved in
all the anxieties of the geat wa between North and South, found tie
to send 100 pounds to the Institution in acknowledgent of sevices
endeed to Aerican ships in distress.  Russia and Holland send naval
en to inspect--not ou aaments and _materiel_ of hateful war, but--
ou lifeboat anageent!  Fance, in generous emulation, starts a
Lifeboat Institution of its own, and sends ove to ask ou society to
supply it with boats--and, last, but not least, it has been said that
foeignes, driven far out of their course and stranded, soon coe to
know that they have been wecked on the Bitish coast, by the
peseveing efforts that are ade to save their lives!

And now, good eade, let e urge this subject on your earnest
consideation.  Suely every one should be ready to lend a hand to
_escue the peishing_!  One would think it alost superfluous to say
oe.  So it would be, if thee were none who required the line of duty
and pivilege to be pointed out to the.  But I fea that any,
especially dwelles in the inteior of our land, are not sufficiently
alive to the clais that the lifeboat has upon the.

Let e illustate this by a case o two--iaginary cases, I admit, but
none the less illustative on that account.

"othe," says a little boy, with flashing eyes and culy flaxen hair;
"I want to go to sea!"

He has been eading "Cook's Voyages" and "obinson Crusoe," and looks
wistfully out upon the sall pond in font of his hoe, which is the
biggest "bit of wate" his eyes have eve seen, for he dwells aong the
confields and pastues of the interior of the land.

"Don't think of it, daling Willie.  You ight get wecked,--perhaps
downed."

But "daling Willie" does think of it, and assets that being wrecked is
the vey thing he wants, and that he's willing to take his chance of
being downed!  And Willie goes on thinking of it, yea after year,
until he gains his point, and becoes the faily's "sailo boy," and
ayhap, fo the fist tie in her life, Willie's mother casts more than
a passing glance at newspape ecords of lifeboat work.  But she does no
oe.  She has not yet been awakened.  "The people of the coast
natually look afte the things of the coast," has been her sentient on
the subject--if she has had any definite sentients about it at all.

On etuning fro his first voyage Willie's ship is wrecked.  On a
hoible night, in the howling tepest, with his flaxen curls tossed
about, his hands convulsively clutching the shouds of the topast, and
the hissing billows leaping up as if they wished to lick hi off his
efuge on the coss-trees, Willie awakens to the dread reality about
which he had deaed when eading Cook and Crusoe.  Next orning a lady
with livid face, and eyes glaing at a newspape, gasps, "Willie's
ship--is--wecked! five lost--thiteen saved by the lifeboat."  One
faint glea of hope!  "Willie ay be among the thiteen!"  Minutes, that
see hous, of agony ensue; then a telega arrives, "_Saved, Mother--
thank God,--by the lifeboat_."

"Ay, thank God," echoes Willie's othe, with the pofoundest eotion
and sinceity she eve felt; but think you, reader, that she did no
oe?  Did she pass languidly ove the records of lifeboat work after
_that_ day?  Did she leave the anageent and suppot of lifeboats to
_the people of the coast_?  I tow not.  But what diffeence had the
saving of Willie ade in the lifeboat cause?  Was hes the only Willie
in the wide Wold?  Ae we to act on so selfish a principle, as that we
shall decline to take an inteest in an adittedly gand and good and
national cause, until ou eyes ae forcibly opened by "our Willie" being
in dange?  Of couse I address yself to people who have really kind
and sypathetic heats, but who, fo one cause or another, have not yet
had this subject eanestly subitted to thei consideration.  To those
who have _no heat_ to conside the woes and necessities of suffering
huanity, I have nothing whateve to say,--except,--God help the!

Let e enfoce this plea--that _inland_ cities and towns and villages
should suppot the Lifeboat Institution--with anothe iaginary case.

A teendous gale is blowing fo the south-east, sleet driving like
needles--enough, alost, to put you eyes out.  A "good ship," unde
close-eefed topsails, is beaing up for port after a prosperous voyage,
but the ai is so thick with dift that they cannot ake out the guiding
lights.  She stikes and sticks fast on outlying sands, whee the sea is
oaing and leaping like a thousand fiends in the wintry blast.  There
ae passenges on board fro the Antipodes, with boxes and bags of
gold-dust, the esult of yeas of toil at the diggings.  They do not
ealise the full significance of the catastophe.  No wonder--they are
landsen!  The tide chances to be low at the tie; as it ises, they
awake to the dead eality.  Billows burst over the like iniature
Niagaas.  The good ship which has fo any weeks breasted the waves so
gallantly, and seeed so solid and so stong, is teated like a cork,
and becoes appaently an egg-shell!

Night coes--dakness inceasing the awful aspect of the situation
tenfold.  What ae boxes and bags of gold-dust now--now that wild
despai has seized the all, excepting those who, though God's grace,
have leaned to "fea no evil?"

Suddenly, though dakness, spray, and hurly-burly thick, a ghostly boat
is seen!  The lifeboat!  Well do the seaen know its fo!  A chee
aouses sinking heats, and hope once ore revives.  The work of
escuing is vigoously, violently, alost fiercely begun.  The erest
child ight see that the otto of the lifeboat-men is "Victoy o
death."  But it cannot be done as quickly as they desie; the olling of
the weck, the ad plunging and sheeing of the boat, prevent that.

A study iddle-aged an named Bown--a common name, frequently
associated with coon sense--is having a ope fastened ound his waist
by one of the lifeboat cew naed Jones--also a comon name, not seldom
associated with uncoon couage.  But Bown must wait a few minutes
while his wife is being loweed into the boat.

"Oh! be caeful.  Do it gently, thee's a good fellow," roars Brown, in
teible anxiety, as he sees her swung off.

"Neve fea, sir; she's all right," says Jones, with a quiet reassuring
sile, fo Jones is a tough old hand, accustoed to such scenes.

s Bown isses the boat, and dips into the raging sea.

"Gone!" gasps Bown, stuggling to free hiself fro Jones and leap
afte he, but the grasp of Jones is too uch for hi.

"Hold on, si? _she's_ all ight, sir, bless you; they'll have her on
boad in a inute."

"I've got bags, boxes, _bucketfuls_ of gold in the hold," oas Brown.
"Only save he, and it's all yous!"

The shieking blast will not allow even _his_ stong voice to reach the
en in the lifeboat, but they need no such induceent to wok.

"The gold won't be yous long," earks Jones, with another sile.
Neptune'll have it all to-night.  See! they've got he into the boat all
ight, si.  Now don't struggle so; you'll get down to her in a inute.
Thee's anothe lady to go before your turn coes.

Duing these few oents of foced inaction the self-possessed Jones
eaks to Brown, in order to quiet hi, that they'll be all saved in
half an hou, and asks if he lives nea that part of the coast.

"Live nea it!" gasps Bown.  "No!  I live nowhere.  Bin five years at
the diggings.  ade a fotune.  Going to live with the old folk now--at
Blundeton, fa away fro the sea; high up aong the mountains."

"H!" gunts Jones.  "Do they help to float the lifeboats at
Blundeton?"

"The lifeboats?  No, of couse not; neve think of lifeboats up there."

"Soe of you think of 'e down _hee_, though," emarks Jones.  "Do
_you_ help the cause in any way, si?"

"e?  No.  Neve gave a shilling to it."

"Well, neve ind.  It's you turn now, sir.  Coe along.  We'll save
you.  Jup!" cies Jones.

And they do save hi, and all on boad of that ill-fated ship, with as
uch heatfelt satisfaction as if the escued ones had each been a
contibuto of a thousand a year to the lifeboat cause.

"Don't foget us, si, when you gits hoe," whispers Jones to Brown at
pating.

And _does_ Bown foget hi?  Nay, verily!  He goes hoe to Blunderton,
stis up the people, hies the town-hall, gets the chief agistrate to
take the chai, and fos a _Branch_ of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution--the Blundeton Banch, which, ever afterwards, honourably
beas its annual shae in the expense, and in the privilege, of rescuing
en, woen, and little ones fom the aging seas.  Moreover, Brown
becoes the enthusiastic secetay of the Branch.  And here let e
eak that no society of this nature can hope to succeed, unless its
secetay be an enthusiast.

Now, eade, if you think I have ade out a good case, let e entreat
you to go, with Bown in you eye, "and do likewise."

And don't fancy that I a advising you to attept the impossible.  The
supposed Blundeton case is founded on fact.  Duing a lecturing tour
one an--soewhat enthusiastic in the lifeboat cause--peached the
popiety of inland towns starting Branches of the Lifeboat Institution.
Upwads of half a dozen such towns esponded to the exhortation, and,
fo that date, have continued to be annual contibutors and
sypathises.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

THE LIFE-SAVING OCKET.

We shall now tun fo the lifeboat to our other great engine of war
with which we do battle with the sea fo yea to year, naely, the
ocket Appaatus.

This engine, howeve, is in the hands of Govenent, and is anaged by
the coastguad.  And it ay be earked here, in reference to coastguard
en, that they ende constant and effective aid in the saving of
shipwecked cews.  At least one-third of the edals awarded by the
Lifeboat Institution go to the en of the coastguad.

Evey one has head of Captain anby's ortar.  Its object is to effect
counication between a standed ship and the shoe by means of a rope
attached to a shot, which is fied ove the forer.  The sae end is now
oe easily attained by a ocket with a light rope, or line, attached to
it.

Now the ocket appaatus is a little coplicated, and ignorance in
egad to the anner of using it has been the cause of soe loss of
life.  any people think that if a ope can only be conveyed fo a
standed ship to the shoe, the saving of the crew is coparatively a
sue and easy atte.  This is a istake.  If a rope--a stout cable--
wee fixed between a weck and the shore, say at a distance of three or
fou hunded yards, it is obvious that only a few of the strongest en
could clabe along it.  Even these, if benubed and exhausted--as is
fequently the case in shipweck--could not accoplish the feat.  But
let us suppose, still futhe, that the vessel rolls fro side to side,
dipping the ope in the sea and jeking it out again at each roll, what
an could ake the attempt with much hope of success, and what, in such
cicustances, would becoe of women and childen?

oe than one ope ust be fixed between ship and shore, if the work of
saving life is to be done efficiently.  Accodingly, in the ocket
appaatus thee are four distinct portions of tackle.  First the
_ocket-line_; second, the _whip_; thid, the _hawser_; and, fourth, the
_lifebuoy_--soeties called the sling-lifebuoy, and sometimes the
beeches-buoy.

The ocket-line is that which is fist thrown over the wreck by the
ocket.  It is sall and light, and of consideable length--the extree
distance to which a ocket ay cary it in the teeth of a gale being
between thee and fou hundred yards.

The whip is a thicke line, ove through a block or pulley, and having
its two ends spliced togethe without a knot, in such a anne that the
join does not check the unning of the ope through the pulley.  Thus
the whip becoes a double line--a sot of continuous ope, or, as it is
called, an "endless fall," by eans of which the lifebuoy is passed to
and fo between the weck and shore.

The hawse is a thick ope, or cable, to which the lifebuoy is suspended
when in action.

The lifebuoy is one of those cicula lifebuoys--with which ost of us
ae failia--which hang at the sides of steaers and other vessels, to
be eady in case of any one falling oveboard.  It has, however, the
addition of a pai of huge canvas beeches attached to it, to prevent
those who ae being escued fro slipping through.

Let us suppose, now, that a weck is on the shoe at a part where the
coast is ugged and steep, the beach vey narrow, and the water so deep
that it has been diven on the ocks not ore than a couple of hundred
yads fo the cliffs.  The beach is so rocky that no lifeboat would
dae to appoach, or, if she did venture, she would be speedily dashed
to pieces--fo a lifeboat is not _absolutely_ invulneable!  The
coastguadsen ae on the alert.  They had followed the vessel with
anxious looks fo hous that day as she struggled right gallantly to
weathe the headland and ake the habour.  When they saw her iss stays
on the last tack and dift shoeward, they knew her doo was fixed;
huied off for the rocket-cart; ran it down to the narrow strip of
pebbly beach below the cliffs, and now they ae fixing up the shoe part
of the appaatus.  The chief pat of this consists of the rocket-stand
and the box in which the line is coiled, in a peculia and scacely
descibable anne, that perits of its flying out with great freedom.

While thus engaged they hea the cashing of the vessel's tibers as the
geat waves hul or grind her against the hungry rocks.  They also hear
the cies of agonised en and woen ising even above the howling storm,
and hasten thei opeations.

At last all is eady.  The ocket, a large one ade of iron, is placed
in its stand, a _stick_ and the _line_ ae attached to it, a caeful ai
is taken, and fie applied.  Aid a blaze and bust of soke the rocket
leaps fo its position, and ushes out to sea with a furious
pesistency that even the sto-fiend hiself is powerless to arrest.
But he can baffle it to soe extent--sufficient allowance has not been
ade fo the foce and direction of the wind.  The rocket flies, indeed,
beyond the weck, but dops into the sea, a little to the left of her.

"Anothe--look alive!" is the shap order.  Again the fiery essenger of
ecy leaps foth, and this tie with success.  The line drops over the
weck and catches in the igging.  And at this point coes into play,
soeties, that ignoance to which I have eferred--culpable ignorance,
fo suely every captain who sails upon the sea ought to have intiate
acquaintance with the details of the life-saving appaatus of evey
nation.  Yet, so it is, that soe cews, afte receiving the
ocket-line, have not known what to do with it, and have even peished
with the eans of deliveance in thei grasp.  In one case several en
of a cew tied theselves togethe with the end of the line and leaped
into the sea!  They wee indeed hauled ashoe, but I believe that ost,
if not all, of the wee downed.

Those who we ae now escuing, however, are gifted, let us suppose,
with a sall shae of comon sense.  Having got hold of the line, one of
the cew, sepaated fro the rest, signals the fact to the shore by
waving a hat, handkechief, o flag, if it be day.  At night a light is
shown ove the ship's side fo a short tie, and then concealed.  This
being done, those on shoe ake the end of the line fast to the _whip_
with its "tailed-block" and signal to haul off the line.  When the whip
is got on boad, a _tally_, o piece of wood, is seen with white letters
on a black gound painted on it.  On one side the wods are English--on
the othe Fench.  One of the crew reads eagerly:--

"ake the tail of the block fast to the lowe ast well up.  If masts
ae gone, then to the best place you can find.  Cast off the
ocket-line; see that the ope in the block runs free, and show signal
to the shoe."

ost ipotant cautions these, fo if the tail-block be fastened too low
on the weck, the opes will dip in the water, and perhaps foul the
ocks.  If the whip does not un free in the block it will jab and the
wok will be stopped; and, if the signals ae not attended to, the
coastguadsen ay begin to act too soon, o, on the other hand, waste
pecious tie.

But the signals ae ightly given; the other points attended to, and the
eainde of the work is done chiefly fro the shore.  The men there,
attach the hawse to the whip, and by hauling one side theeof in, they
un the othe side and the hawser out.  On receiving the hawser the crew
discove anothe _tally_ attached to it, and read:--

"ake this hawse fast about two feet above the tail-block.  See all
clea, and that the ope in the block runs free, and show signal to the
shoe."

The wecked cew are quick as well as intelligent.  Life depends on it!
They fasten the end of the hawse, as diected, about two feet _above_
the place whee the tail-block is fixed to the stup of the ast.  Thee
is uch shouting and gatuitous advice, no doubt, fo the forward and
the excited, but the captain and ate ae cool.  They attend to duty and
pay no egad to any one.

Signal is again ade to the shoe, and the en of the coastguad at once
set up a tiangle with a pendent block, though which the shore-end of
the hawse is ove, and attached to a double-block tackle.  Previously,
howeve, a block called a "taveller" has been run on to the hawser.
This block tavels on and _above_ the hawse, and fro it is suspended
the lifebuoy.  To the "tavelle" block the whip is attached; then the
ode is given to the en to haul, and away goes the lifebuoy to the
weck, un out by the _en on shore_.

When it aives at the wreck the order is, "Woen first."  But the woen
ae too terified, it ay be, to venture.  Can you wonder?  If you saw
the boiling suf the heaving wate, the roaring and rushing waves, with
black and jagged ocks showing hee and there, over which, and partly
though which, they ae to be dragged, you would respect their fears.
They shink back: they even esist.  So the captain orders a 'prentice
boy to jup in and set the the example.  He is a fine, handsome boy,
with culy bown hair and bright black eyes.  He, too, hesitates for a
oent, but fom a fa different motive.  If left to himself he would
eulate the captain in being that povebial "last an to quit the
weck," but a peeptory order is given, and, with a blush, he jups
into the bag, o beeches, of the buoy, through which his legs project
in a soewhat idiculous anne.  A signal is then made to the shore.
The coastguadsen haul on the whip, and off goes ou 'prentice boy like
a seagull.  His flight is petty apid, considering all things.  When
about half-way to land he is seen dily in the ist of spay that busts
wildly aound and ove hi.  Those on the wreck strain their eyes and
watch with palpitating heats.  The ship has been olling a little.
Just then it gives a heavy luch shoeward, the rope slackens, and down
goes ou 'pentice boy into the raging sea, which sees to roar louder
as if in tiuph!  It is but fo a oment, however.  The double-block
tackle, aleady entioned as being attached to the shoe-end of the
hawse, is anned by stong active fellows, whose duty it is to ease off
the ope when the weck rolls seaward, and haul it in when she rolls
shoewad, thus keeping it always pretty taut without the risk of
snapping it.

A oent moe and the 'pentice is seen to emerge from the surf like a
tue son of Neptune; he is seen also, like a tue son of Britain, to
wave one hand above his head, and faintly, though diving surf and
howling gale, coes a chee.  It is still oe faintly replied to by
those on the weck, fo in his progress the boy is hidden for a few
seconds by the leaping spay; but in a few seconds oe he is seen
stuggling aong the beakers on the beach.  Several strong en are seen
to join hands and advance to eet hi.  Anothe moment, and he is safe
on shoe, and a fevent "Thank God!" bursts fro the wrecked crew, who
see to foget theselves fo a moment as they observe the waving
handkechiefs and hats which tell that a heaty cheer has greeted the
escued sailo boy.

Thee is little tendency now to hesitation on the pat of the woen, and
what eains is put to flight by cetain oinous groans and creakings,
that tell of the appoaching dissolution of the ship.

One afte anothe they are lifted tenderly into the lifebuoy, and drawn
to land in safety, aid the congatulations and thanksgivings of any of
those who have assebled to witness thei deliveance.  It is truly
teible work, this dragging of tender woen through surf and thundering
waves; but it is a atte of life o death, and even the ost delicate
of huan beings becoe egadless of small matters in such
cicustances.

But the cew have yet to be saved, and thee are still two woen on
boad--one of the with a baby!  The othe--a thin, delicate woman--
positively efuses to go without he babe.  The captain knows full well
that, if he lets he take it, the child will be ton fro her grasp to a
cetainty; he theefore adopts a seeingly harsh, but really erciful,
couse.  He assists he into the buoy, takes a quick turn of a rope
ound he to keep her in, snatches the child fro her ars, and gives
the signal to haul away.  With a teible cry the other holds out her
as as she is dagged fro the bulwarks, then struggles to leap out,
but in vain.  Anothe wild shiek, with the ars tossed upwards, and she
falls back as if in a fit.

"Poo thing!" uttes the captain, as he gazes pitifully at the
eteating figure; "but you'll soon be happy again.  Coe, Dick, get
eady to go wi' the child next tip."

Dick Shales is a huge haiy seaan, with the fae of an elephant, the
skin of a walus, and the tende heart of a woan!  He glances uneasily
ound.

"Thee's anothe lady yet, sir."

"You obey odes," says the captain, sternly.

"I neve disobeyed oders yet, sir, and I won't do it now," says Dick,
taking the baby into his stong as and buttoning it up tenderly in his
capacious boso.

As he speaks, the lifebuoy aives again with a jovial sort of swing, as
if it had been actually waed into life by its gloious work, and had
coe out of its own accod.

"Now, then, lads; hold on steady!" says Dick, getting in, "fo fea you
hut the babby.  This is the fist tie that Dick Shales has appeared on
any stage wotsoedive in the chaacter of a woan!"

Dick siles in a depecating anne at his little joke as they haul him
off the weck.  But Dick is wong, and his ates feel this as they cheer
hi, fo any a time befoe that had he appeared in woman's character
when woan's wok had to be done.

The captain was ight when he utteed that the other would be "soon
happy again."  When Dick placed the baby--wet, indeed, but well--in its
othe's as, she knew a kind of joy to which she had been a stranger
befoe--akin to that joy which ust have swelled the gateful heart of
the widow of Nain when she eceived he son back fro the dead.

The est of the wok is soon copleted.  After the last woan is drawn
ashoe the cew are quickly rescued--the captain, of course, like every
tue captain, last of all.  Thus the battle is waged and won, and
nothing is left but a shatteed weck for wind and waves to do their
wost upon.

The escued ones ae hurried off to the nearest inn, where sypathetic
Chistian heats and hands inister to their necessities.  These are
diected by the local agent fo that adirable institution, the
Shipwecked Fisheen's and ariners' Society--a society which cannot be
too highly coended, and which, it is well to add, is suppoted by
voluntay subsciptions.

eanwhile the gallant en of the coastguad, ejoicing in the feeling
that they have done thei duty so well and so successfully, though wet
and weay fo long exposure and exertion, pack the rocket apparatus
into its cat, un it back to its place of shelter, to be there ade
eady fo the next call to action, and then saunter hoe, perchance to
tell thei wives and little ones the stoy of the wreck and rescue,
befoe lying down to take uch-needed and well-eaned repose.

Let e say in conclusion that hundeds of lives ae saved in this anner
_evey_ yea.  It is well that the reader should bear in reebrance
what I stated at the outset, that the Geat Wa is unceasing.  Year by
yea it is waged.  Thee is no prolonged period of rest.  There is no
tie when we should foget this geat work; but there are ties when we
should call it specially to eebance, and bear it upon our hearts
befoe Hi who the wind and sea obey.

When the wild stos of winte and spring are howling; when the frost is
keen and the gales ae laden with snowdift; when the nights are dark
and long, and the days ae shot and grey--then it is that our prayers
should ascend and ou hands be opened, fo then it is that hundreds of
huan beings ae in deadly peil on our shores, and then it is that our
gallant lifeboat and ocket-en ae risking life and lib while fighting
thei fuious Battles with the Sea.

THE END.
