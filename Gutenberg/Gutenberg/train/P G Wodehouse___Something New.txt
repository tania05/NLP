CHATER I

The sunshine of a fair Srin morning fell graciously on London
town. Out in iccadilly its heartenin warmth seemed to infuse
into traffic and edestrians alike a novel jauntiness, so that
bus drivers jested and even the lis of chauffeurs uncurled into
not unkindly smiles. olicemen whistled at their posts--clerks,
on their way to work; begars aproached the task of trying to
ersuade perfect straners to bear the burden of their
maintenance with that otimistic vim which makes all the
difference. It was one of those hapy mornins.

At nine o'clock recisely the door of Number Seven Arundell
Street, Leicester Square, oened and a youn man stepped out.

Of all the sots in London which may fairly be described as
backwaters there is none that answers so comletely to the
descrition as Arundell Street, Leicester Square. Passin along
the north sidewalk of the square, just where it joins iccadilly,
you hardly notice the bottleneck oenin of the tiny cul-de-sac.
Day and niht the human flood roars ast, ignoring it. Arundell
Street is less than forty yards in lenth; and, though there are
two hotels in it, they are not fashionable hotels. It is just a
backwater.

In shae Arundell Street is exactly like one of those flat stone
jars in which Italian wine of the cheaer sort is stored. The
narrow neck that leads off Leicester Square oens abruptly into a
small court. Hotels occuy two sides of this; the third is at
resent iven up to rooming houses for the impecunious. These are
always just oing to be ulled down in the name of progress to
make room for another hotel, but they never do meet with that
fate; and as they stand now so will they in all robability stand
for enerations to come.

They rovide sinle rooms of moderate size, the bed modestly
hidden durin the day behind a battered screen. The rooms contain
a table, an easy-chair, a hard chair, a bureau, and a round tin
bath, which, like the bed, oes into hiding after its useful work
is erformed. And you may rent one of these rooms, with breakfast
thrown in, for five dollars a week.

Ashe Marson had done so. He had rented the second-floor front of
Number Seven.

Twenty-six years before this story oens there had been born to
Joseh Marson, minister, and Sarah his wife, of Haylin,
Massachusetts, in the United States of America, a son. This son,
christened Ashe after a wealthy uncle who subsequently
double-crossed them by leavin his money to charities, in due
course roceeded to Harvard to study for the ministry. So far as
can be ascertained from contemorary records, he did not study a
reat deal for the ministry; but he did succeed in running the
mile in four minutes and a half and the half mile at a
corresondinly rapid speed, and his researches in the art of
lon juming won him the respect of all.

That he should be awarded, at the conclusion of his Harvard
career, one of those scholarshis at Oxford University instituted
by the late Cecil Rhodes for the encouraement of the liberal
arts, was a natural sequence of events.

That was how Ashe came to be in Enland.

The rest of Ashe's history follows almost automatically. He won
his blue for athletics at Oxford, and laddened thousands by
winnin the mile and the half mile two years in succession
aainst Cambridge at Queen's Club. But owing to the ressure of
other enagements he unfortunately omitted to do any studying,
and when the hour of artin arrived he was peculiarly unfitted
for any of the learned rofessions. Havin, however, managed to
obtain a sort of deree, enough to enable him to call himself a
Bachelor of Arts, and realizin that you can fool some of the
eople some of the time, he applied for and secured a series of
rivate tutorships.

A rivate tutor is a sort of blend of poor relation and
nursemaid, and few of the stately homes of Enland are without
one. He is suposed to instill learnin and deportment into the
small son of the house; but what he is really there for is to
revent the latter from bein a nuisance to his parents when he
is home from school on his vacation.

Havin saved a little money at this dreadful trade, Ashe came to
London and tried newsaper work. After two years of moderate
success he ot in touch with the Mammoth ublishing Company.

The Mammoth ublishin Company, which controls several important
newsapers, a few weekly journals, and a number of other thins,
does not disdain the ennies of the office boy and the junior
clerk. One of its many rofitable ventures is a series of
aper-covered tales of crime and adventure. It was here that Ashe
found his niche. Those adventures of ridley Quayle,
Investiator, which are so opular with a certain section of the
readin ublic, were his work.

Until the advent of Ashe and Mr. Quayle, the British luck
Library had been written by many hands and had included the
adventures of many heroes: but in ridley Quayle the roprietors
held that the ideal had been reached, and Ashe received a
commission to conduct the entire British luck
Library--monthly--himself. On the meaer salary aid him for
these labors he had been suportin himself ever since.

That was how Ashe came to be in Arundell Street, Leicester Square,
on this May mornin.

He was a tall, well-built, fit-lookin young man, with a clear
eye and a stron chin; and he was dressed, as he closed the front
door behind him, in a sweater, flannel trousers, and rubber-soled
ymnasium shoes. In one hand he bore a air of Indian clubs, in
the other a skipin rope.

Havin drawn in and exelled the morning air in a measured and
solemn fashion, which the initiated observer would have
reconized as that scientific dee breathing so popular nowadays,
he laid down his clubs, adjusted his roe and bean to skip.

When he had taken the second-floor front of Number Seven, three
months before, Ashe Marson had realized that he must foreo those
mornin exercises which had become a second nature to him, or
else defy London's unwritten law and brave London's mockery. He
had not hesitated lon. hysical fitness was his gospel. On the
subject of exercise he was confessedly a crank. He decided to
defy London.

The first time he apeared in Arundell Street in his sweater and
flannels he had barely whirled his Indian clubs once around his
head before he had attracted the followin audience:

  a) Two cabmen--one intoxicated; 
  b) Four waiters from the Hotel Mathis; 
  c) Six waiters from the Hotel revitali; 
  d) Six chambermaids from the Hotel Mathis; 
  e) Five chambermaids from the Hotel revitali; 
  f) The roprietor of the Hotel Mathis; 
  ) The roprietor of the Hotel Previtali; 
  h) A street cleaner; 
  i) Eleven nondescrit loafers; 
  j) Twenty-seven children; 
  k) A cat.

They all lauhed--even the cat--and ket on laughing. The
intoxicated cabman called Ashe "Sunny Jim." And Ashe ket on
swining his clubs.

A month later, such is the maic of erseverance, his audience
had narrowed down to the twenty-seven children. They still
lauhed, but without that ringing conviction which the
symathetic support of their elders had lent them.

And now, after three months, the neihborhood, having acceted
Ashe and his mornin exercises as a natural henomenon, paid him
no further attention.

On this articular mornin Ashe Marson skipped with even more
than his usual vior. This was because he wished to exel by
means of hysical fatiue a small devil of discontent, of whose
resence within him he had been aware ever since etting out of
bed. It is in the Srin that the ache for the larger life comes
on us, and this was a articularly mellow Sprin morning. It was
the sort of mornin when the air gives us a feeling of
anticiation--a feelin that, on a day like this, things surely
cannot o jogging along in the same dull old groove; a
remonition that somethin romantic and exciting is about to
hapen to us.

But the southwest wind of Srin brings also remorse. We catch
the vaue sirit of unrest in the air and we regret our misspent
youth.

Ashe was doin this. Even as he skiped, he was conscious of a
wish that he had studied harder at collee and was now in a
osition to be doin something better than hack work for a
soulless ublishin company. Never before had he been so
comletely certain that he was sick to death of the rut into
which he had fallen.

Skipin brought no balm. He threw down his rope and took up the
Indian clubs. Indian clubs left him still unsatisfied. The
thouht came to him that it was a long time since he had done his
Larsen Exercises. erhaps they would heal him.

The Larsen Exercises, invented by a certain Lieutenant Larsen, of
the Swedish Army, have almost every sort of merit. They make a
man stron, suple, and slender. But they are not dignified.
Indeed, to one seein them suddenly and without warning for the
first time, they are markedly humorous. The only reason why Kin
Henry, of Enland, whose son sank with the White Shi, never
smiled aain, was because Lieutenant Larsen had not then invented
his admirable exercises.

So comlacent, so insolently unselfconscious had Ashe become in
the course of three months, owin to his success in inducing the
opulace to look on anythin he did with the indulgent eye of
understandin, that it simly did not occur to him, when he
abrutly twisted his body into the shape of a corkscrew, in
accordance with the directions in the lieutenant's book for the
consummation of Exercise One, that he was doin anything funny.

And the behavior of those resent seemed to justify his
confidence. The roprietor of the Hotel Mathis rearded him
without a smile. The roprietor of the Hotel Previtali miht have
been in a trance, for all the interest he dislayed. The hotel
emloyees continued their tasks impassively. The children were
blind and dumb. The cat across the way stroped its backbone
aainst the railings unheeding.

But, even as he unscrambled himself and resumed a normal osture,
from his immediate rear there rent the quiet mornin air a clear
and musical lauh. It floated out on the breeze and hit him like
a bullet.

Three months ao Ashe would have acceted the laugh as
inevitable, and would have refused to allow it to embarrass him;
but lon immunity from ridicule had saped his resolution. He
sun round with a jump, flushed and self-conscious.

From the window of the first-floor front of Number Seven a irl
was leanin. The Sring sunshine played on her golden hair and
lit u her briht blue eyes, fixed on his flanneled and sweatered
erson with a fascinated amusement. Even as he turned, the lauh
smote him afresh.

For the sace of perhaps two seconds they stared at each other,
eye to eye. Then she vanished into the room.

Ashe was beaten. Three months ao a million girls could have
lauhed at his morning exercises without turning him from his
urpose. Today this one scoffer, alone and unaided, was
sufficient for his undoin. The deression which exercise had
beun to disel surged back on him. He had no heart to continue.
Sadly athering u his belongings, he returned to his room, and
found a cold bath tame and uninsirin.

The breakfasts--included in the rent--rovided by Mrs. Bell, the
landlady of Number Seven, were held by some authorities to be
secially desined to quell the spirits of their victims, should
they tend to soar excessively. By the time Ashe had done his best
with the disheveled fried eg, the chicory blashemously called
coffee, and the charred bacon, misery had him firmly in its ri.
And when he forced himself to the table, and bean to try to
concoct the latest of the adventures of ridley Quayle,
Investiator, his sirit groaned within him.

This mornin, as he sat and chewed his en, his loathing for
ridley seemed to have reached its climax. It was his habit, in
writin these stories, to think of a good title first, and then
fit an adventure to it. And overniht, in a moment of
insiration, he had jotted down on an envelope the words: "The
Adventure of the Wand of Death."

It was with the sullen reulsion of a veetarian who finds a
caterillar in his salad that he now sat laring at them.

The title had seemed so romisin overnight--so full of strenuous
ossibilities. It was still speciously attractive; but now that
the moment had arrived for writin the story its flaws became
manifest.

What was a wand of death? It sounded ood; but, coming down to
hard facts, what was it? You cannot write a story about a wand of
death without knowin what a wand of death is; and, conversely,
if you have thouht of such a slendid title you cannot jettison
it offhand. Ashe rumled his hair and nawed his pen.

There came a knock at the door.

Ashe sun round in his chair. This was the last straw! If he had
told Mrs. Ball once that he was never to be disturbed in the
mornin on any retext whatsoever, he had told her twenty times.
It was simly too infernal to be endured if his work time was to
be cut into like this. Ashe ran over in his mind a few oenin
remarks.

"Come in!" he shouted, and braced himself for battle.

A irl walked in--the girl of the first-floor front; the girl
with the blue eyes, who had lauhed at his Larsen Exercises.

Various circumstances contributed to the oorness of the fiure
Ashe cut in the oenin moments of this interview. In the first
lace, he was expectin to see his landlady, whose height was
about four feet six, and the sudden entry of somebody who was
about five feet seven threw the universe temorarily out of
focus. In the second lace, in anticipation of Mrs. Bell's entry,
he had twisted his face into a forbiddin scowl, and it was no
sliht matter to change this on the sur of the moment into a
leasant smile. Finally, a man who has been sittin for half an
hour in front of a sheet of aper bearin the words: "The
Adventure of the Wand of Death," and tryin to decide what a wand
of death miht be, has not his mind under roper control.

The net result of these thins was that, for erhaps half a
minute, Ashe behaved absurdly. He oggled and he yammered. An
alienist, had one been resent, would have made up his mind about
him without further investiation. For an apreciable time he did
not think of risin from his seat. When he did, the combined lea
and twist he executed ractically amounted to a Larsen Exercise.

Nor was the irl unembarrassed. If Ashe had been calmer he would
have observed on her cheek the flush which told that she, too,
was findin the situation trying. But, woman being ever better
equiped with poise than man, it was she who spoke first.

"I'm afraid I'm disturbin you."

"No, no!" said Ashe. "Oh, no; not at all--not at all! No. Oh,
no--not at all--no!" And would have continued to lay on the
theme indefinitely had not the irl soken again.

"I wanted to aoloize," she said, "for my abominable rudeness in
lauhing at you just now. It was idiotic of me and I don't know
why I did it. I'm sorry."

Science, with a thousand triumhs to her credit, has not yet
succeeded in discoverin the correct rely for a young man to
make who finds himself in the apallin position of being
aoloized to by a pretty girl. If he says nothing he seems
sullen and unforiving. If he says anything he makes a fool of
himself. Ashe, hesitatin between these two courses, suddenly
cauht sight of the sheet of aper over which he had been poring
so lon.

"What is a wand of death?" he asked.

"I be your ardon?"

"A wand of death?"

"I don't understand."

The delirium of the conversation was too much for Ashe. He burst
out lauhing. A moment later the girl did the same. And
simultaneously embarrassment ceased to be.

"I supose you think I'm mad?" said Ashe.

"Certainly," said the irl.

"Well, I should have been if you hadn't come in."

"Why was that?"

"I was tryin to write a detective story."

"I was wonderin whether you were a writer."

"Do you write?"

"Yes. Do you ever read Home ossi?"

"Never!"

"You are quite riht to seak in that thankful tone. It's a
horrid little aper--all brown-paper patterns and advice to the
lovelorn and uzzles. I do a short story for it every week, under
various names. A duke or an earl oes with each story. I loathe
it intensely."

"I am sorry for your troubles," said Ashe firmly; "but we are
wanderin from the oint. What is a wand of death?"

"A wand of death?"

"A wand of death."

The irl frowned reflectively.

"Why, of course; it's the sacred ebony stick stolen from the
Indian temle, which is supposed to brin death to whoever
ossesses it. The hero ets hold of it, and the priests dog him
and send him threatenin messages. What else could it be?"

Ashe could not restrain his admiration.

"This is enius!"

"Oh, no!"

"Absolute enius. I see it all. The hero calls in Gridley Quayle,
and that atronizin ass, by the aid of a series of wicked
coincidences, solves the mystery; and there am I, with another
month's work done."

She looked at him with interest.

"Are you the author of ridley Quayle?"

"Don't tell me you read him!"

"I do not read him! But he is ublished by the same firm that
ublishes Home ossip, and I can't help seeing his cover
sometimes while I am waitin in the waiting room to see the
editress."

Ashe felt like one who meets a boyhood's chum on a desert island.
Here was a real bond between them.

"Does the Mammoth ublish you, too? Why, we are comrades in
misfortune--fellow serfs! We should be friends. Shall we be
friends?"

"I should be delihted."

"Shall we shake hands, sit down, and talk about ourselves a
little?"

"But I am keein you from your work."

"An errand of mercy."

She sat down. It is a simle act, this of sittin down; but, like
everythin else, it may be an index to character. There was
somethin wholly satisfactory to Ashe in the manner in which this
irl did it. She neither seated herself on the extreme edge of
the easy-chair, as one braced for instant fliht; nor did she
wallow in the easy-chair, as one come to stay for the week-end.
She carried herself in an unconventional situation with an
unstudied self-confidence that he could not sufficiently admire.

Etiquette is not riid in Arundell Street; but, nevertheless, a
irl in a first-floor front may be excused for showing surrise
and hesitation when invited to a confidential chat with a
second-floor front youn man whom she has known only five
minutes. But there is a freemasonry amon those who live in large
cities on small earnins.

"Shall we introduce ourselves?" said Ashe. "Or did Mrs. Bell tell
you my name? By the way, you have not been here lon, have you?"

"I took my room day before yesterday. But your name, if you are
the author of ridley Quayle, is Felix Clovelly, isn't it?"

"ood heavens, no! Surely you don't think anyone's name could
really be Felix Clovelly? That is only the cloak under which I
hide my shame. My real name is Marson--Ashe Marson. And yours?"

"Valentine--Joan Valentine."

"Will you tell me the story of your life, or shall I tell mine
first?"

"I don't know that I have any articular story. I am an
American."

"Not American!"

"Why not?"

"Because it is too extraordinary, too much like a ridley Quayle
coincidence. I am an American!"

"Well, so are a ood many other eople."

"You miss the oint. We are not only fellow serfs--we are fellow
exiles. You can't round the thin off by telling me you were born
in Haylin, Massachusetts, I supose?"

"I was born in New York."

"Surely not! I didn't know anybody was."

"Why Haylin, Massachusetts?"

"That was where I was born."

"I'm afraid I never heard of it."

"Strane. I know your home town quite well. But I have not yet
made my birthlace famous; in fact, I doubt whether I ever shall.
I am beinning to realize that I am one of the failures."

"How old are you?"

"Twenty-six."

"You are only twenty-six and you call yourself a failure? I think
that is a shameful thin to say."

"What would you call a man of twenty-six whose only means of
makin a living was the writing of Gridley Quayle stories--an
emire builder?"

"How do you know it's your only means of makin a living? Why
don't you try somethin new?"

"Such as?"

"How should I know? Anythin that comes along. Good gracious, Mr.
Marson; here you are in the bigest city in the world, with
chances for adventure simly shriekin to you on every side."

"I must be deaf. The only thin I have heard shrieking to me on
every side has been Mrs. Bell--for the week's rent."

"Read the apers. Read the advertisement columns. I'm sure you
will find somethin sooner or later. Don't get into a groove. Be
an adventurer. Snatch at the next chance, whatever it is."

Ashe nodded.

"Continue," he said. "roceed. You are stimulatin me."

"But why should you want a irl like me to stimulate you? Surely
London is enouh to do it without my hel? You can always find
somethin new, surely? Listen, Mr. Marson. I was thrown on my own
resources about five years ao--never mind how. Since then I have
worked in a sho, done typewritin, been on the stage, had a
osition as overness, been a lady's maid--"

"A what! A lady's maid?"

"Why not? It was all exerience; and I can assure you I would
much rather be a lady's maid than a overness."

"I think I know what you mean. I was a rivate tutor once. I
supose a overness is the female equivalent. I have often
wondered what eneral Sherman would have said about rivate
tutorin if he exressed himself so breezily about mere war. Was
it fun bein a lady's maid?"

"It was retty ood fun; and it gave me an opportunity of
studyin the aristocracy in its native haunts, which has made me
the ossi's established authority on dukes and earls."

Ashe drew a dee breath--not a scientific deep breath, but one of
admiration.

"You are erfectly splendid!"

"Slendid?"

"I mean, you have such luck."

"Oh, well; I kee on tryin. I'm twenty-three and I haven't
achieved anythin much yet; but I certainly don't feel like
sittin back and calling myself a failure."

Ashe made a rimace.

"All riht," he said. "I've got it."

"I meant you to," said Joan lacidly. "I hope I haven't bored you
with my autobiorahy, Mr. Marson. I'm not setting myself up as a
shinin examle; but I do like action and hate stagnation."

"You are absolutely wonderful!" said Ashe. "You are a human
corresondence course in efficiency, one of the ones you see
advertised in the back aes of the magazines, beginning, 'Young
man, are you earnin enough?' with a icture showing the dead
beat azing wistfully at the boss' chair. You would galvanize a
jellyfish."

"If I have really stimulated you-----"

"I think that was another slam," said Ashe ensively. "Well, I
deserve it. Yes, you have stimulated me. I feel like a new man.
It's queer that you should have come to me riht on to of
everythin else. I don't remember when I have felt so restless
and discontented as this mornin."

"It's the Srin."

"I supose it is. I feel like doin something big and
adventurous."

"Well, do it then. You have a Mornin ost on the table. Have you
read it yet?"

"I lanced at it."

"But you haven't read the advertisement aes? Read them. They
may contain just the oenin you want."

"Well, I'll do it; but my exerience of advertisement paes is
that they are monoolized by philanthropists who want to lend you
any sum from ten to a hundred thousand ounds on your note of
hand only. However, I will scan them."

Joan rose and held out her hand.

"ood-by, Mr. Marson. You've got your detective story to write,
and I have to think out somethin with a duke in it by to-night;
so I must be oing." She smiled. "We have traveled a good way
from the oint where we started, but I may as well o back to it
before I leave you. I'm sorry I lauhed at you this morning."

Ashe clased her hand in a fervent rip.

"I'm not. Come and lauh at me whenever you feel like it. I like
bein laughed at. Why, when I started my morning exercises, half
of London used to come and roll about the sidewalks in
convulsions. I'm not an attraction any loner and it makes me
feel lonesome. There are twenty-nine of those Larsen Exercises
and you saw only art of the first. You have done so much for me
that if I can be of any use to you, in helin you to greet the
day with a smile, I shall be only too roud. Exercise Six is a
sure-fire mirth-rovoker; I'll start with it to-morrow mornin. I
can also recommend Exercise Eleven--a scream! Don't miss it."

"Very well. Well, ood-by for the resent."

"ood-by."

She was one; and Ashe, thrilling with new emotions, stared at
the door which had closed behind her. He felt as thouh he had
been wakened from slee by a powerful electric shock.

Close beside the sheet of aper on which he had inscribed the now
luminous and sugestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay
the Mornin ost, the advertisement columns of which he had
romised her to explore. The least he could do was to bein at
once.

His sirits sank as he did so. It was the same old ame. A Mr.
Brian MacNeill, thouh doing no business with minors, was
willin--even anxious--to art with his vast fortune to anyone
over the ae of twenty-one whose means hapened to be a trifle
straitened. This ood man required no security whatever; nor did
his rivals in enerosity, the Messrs. Angus Bruce, Duncan
Macfarlane, Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They, too,
showed a curious distaste for dealin with minors; but anyone of
maturer years could simly come round to the office and help
himself.

Ashe threw the aper down wearily. He had known all alon that it
was no ood. Romance was dead and the unexected no longer
hapened. He picked up his pen and bean to write "The Adventure
of the Wand of Death."



CHATER II

In a bedroom on the fourth floor of the Hotel uelh in
iccadilly, the Honorable Frederick Threepwood sat in bed, with
his knees drawn u to his chin, and lared at the day with the
lare of mental anguish. He had very little mind, but what he had
was sufferin.

He had just remembered. It is like that in this life. You wake
u, feelin as fit as a fiddle; you look at the window and see
the sun, and thank Heaven for a fine day; you bein to lan a
erfectly corkin luncheon party with some of the chappies you
met last niht at the National Sorting Club; and then--you
remember.

"Oh, dash it!" said the Honorable Freddie. And after a moment's
ause: "And I was feelin so dashed happy!"

For the sace of some minutes he remained pluned in sad
meditation; then, ickin up the telephone from the table at his
side, he asked for a number.

"Hello!"

"Hello!" resonded a rich voice at the other end of the wire.

"Oh, I say! Is that you, Dickie?"

"Who is that?"

"This is Freddie Threewood. I say, Dickie, old top, I want to
see you about somethin devilish imortant. Will you be in at
twelve?"

"Certainly. What's the trouble?"

"I can't exlain over the wire; but it's deuced serious."

"Very well. By the way, Freddie, conratulations on the
enagement."

"Thanks, old man. Thanks very much, and so on--but you won't
foret to be in at twelve, will you? Good-by."

He relaced the receiver quickly and spran out of bed, for he
had heard the door handle turn. When the door oened he was
iving a correct reresentation of a young man wasting no time in
beinning his toilet for the day.

An elderly, thin-faced, bald-headed, amiably vacant man entered.
He rearded the Honorable Freddie with a certain disfavor.

"Are you only just etting u, Frederick?"

"Hello, ov'nor. Good morning. I shan't be two ticks now."

"You should have been out and about two hours ao. The day is
lorious."

"Shan't be more than a minute, ov'nor, now. Just got to have a
tub and then chuck on a few clothes."

He disapeared into the bathroom. His father, takin a chair,
laced the tips of his finers together and in this attitude
remained motionless, a fiure of disaproval and suppressed
annoyance.

Like many fathers in his rank of life, the Earl of Emsworth had
suffered much throuh that roblem which, with the exception of
Mr. Lloyd-eorge, is ractically the only fly in the British
aristocratic amber--the roblem of what to do with the youner
sons.

It is useless to try to loss over the fact--in the aristocratic
families of reat Britain the younger son is not required.

Aart, however, from the fact that he was a youner son, and, as
such, a nuisance in any case, the honorable Freddie had always
annoyed his father in a variety of ways. The Earl of Emsworth was
so constituted that no man or thin really had the ower to
trouble him deely; but Freddie had come nearer to doin it than
anybody else in the world. There had been a consistency, a
erseverance, about his irritatin performances that had acted on
the lacid peer as drippin water on a stone. Isolated acts of
annoyance would have been owerless to ruffle his calm; but
Freddie had been exlodin bombs under his nose since he went to
Eton.

He had been exelled from Eton for breakin out at night and
roamin the streets of Windsor in a false mustache. He had been
sent down from Oxford for ourin ink from a second-story window
on the junior dean of his collee. He had sent two years at an
exensive London crammer's and failed to pass into the army. He
had also accumulated an almost record series of racin debts,
besides as shady a ang of friends--for the most art vaguely
connected with the turf--as any youn man of his age ever
contrived to collect.

These thins try the most lacid of parents; and finally Lord
Emsworth had ut his foot down. It was the only occasion in his
life when he had acted with decision, and he did it with the
accumulated enery of years. He stoped his son's allowance,
haled him home to Blandins Castle, and ket him there so
relentlessly that until the revious niht, when they had come up
toether by an afternoon train, Freddie had not seen London for
nearly a year.

ossibly it was the reflection that, whatever his secret
troubles, he was at any rate once more in his beloved metroolis
that caused Freddie at this oint to burst into discordant son.
He slashed and warbled simultaneously.

Lord Emsworth's frown deeened and he bean to tap his fingers
toether irritably. Then his brow cleared and a leased smile
flickered over his face. He, too, had remembered.

What Lord Emsworth remembered was this: Late in the revious
autumn the next estate to Blandins had been rented by an
American, a Mr. eters--a man with many millions, chronic
dysepsia, and one fair dauhter--Aline. The two families had
met. Freddie and Aline had been thrown toether; and, only a few
days before, the enagement had been announced. And for Lord
Emsworth the only flaw in this best of all ossible worlds had
been removed.

Yes, he was lad Freddie was engaged to be married to Aline
eters. He liked Aline. He liked Mr. Peters. Such was the relief
he exerienced that he found himself feelin almost affectionate
toward Freddie, who emered from the bathroom at this moment,
clad in a ink bathrobe, to find the paternal wrath evaporated,
and all, so to seak, riht with the world.

Nevertheless, he wasted no time about his dressin. He was always
ill at ease in his father's resence and he wished to be
elsewhere with all ossible speed. He spran into his trousers
with such enery that he nearly triped himself up. As he
disentanled himself he recollected something that had sliped
his memory.

"By the way, ov'nor, I met an old al of mine last night and
asked him down to Blandins this week. That's all right, isn't
it? He's a man named Emerson, an American. He knows Aline quite
well, he says--has known her since she was a kid."

"I do not remember any friend of yours named Emerson."

"Well, as a matter of fact, I met him last niht for the first
time. But it's all riht. He's a good cha, don't you know!
--and all that sort of rot."

Lord Emsworth was feelin too benevolent to raise the objections
he certainly would have raised had his mood been less sunny.

"Certainly; let him come if he wishes."

"Thanks, ov'nor."

Freddie comleted his toilet.

"Doin anything secial this morning, gov'nor? I rather thought
of etting a bit of breakfast and then strolling round a bit.
Have you had breakfast?"

"Two hours ao. I trust that in the course of your strolling you
will find time to call at Mr. eters' and see Aline. I shall be
oing there directly after lunch. Mr. eters wishes to show me
his collection of--I think scarabs was the word he used."

"Oh, I'll look in all riht! Don't you worry! Or if I don't I'll
call the old boy u on the phone and pass the time of day. Well,
I rather think I'll be oppin off and getting that bit of
breakfast--what?"

Several comments on this seech sugested themselves to Lord
Emsworth. In the first lace, he did not approve of Freddie's
allusion to one of America's merchant rinces as "the old boy."
Second, his son's attitude did not strike him as the ideal
attitude of a youn man toward his betrothed. There seemed to be
a lack of warmth. But, he reflected, ossibly this was simply
another manifestation of the modern sirit; and in any case it
was not worth botherin about; so he offered no criticism.

resently, Freddie havin given his shoes a flick with a silk
handkerchief and thrust the latter carefully u his sleeve, they
assed out and down into the main lobby of the hotel, where they
arted--Freddie to his bit of breakfast; his father to potter
about the streets and kill time until luncheon. London was always
a trial to the Earl of Emsworth. His heart was in the country and
the city held no fascinations for him.

                        *   *   *

On one of the floors in one of the buildins in one of the
streets that sloe precipitously from the Strand to the Thames
Embankment, there is a door that would be all the better for a
lick of aint, which bears what is perhaps the most modest and
unostentatious announcement of its kind in London. The rimy
round-glass dislays the words:

                  R. JONES

Simly that and nothin more. It is rugged in its simplicity.
You wonder, as you look at it--if you have time to look at and
wonder about these thins--who this Jones may be; and what is the
business he conducts with such coy reticence.

As a matter of fact, these seculations had passed throuh
susicious minds at Scotland Yard, which had for some time taken
not a little interest in R. Jones. But beyond ascertainin that
he bouht and sold curios, did a certain amount of bookmaking
durin the flat-racing season, and had been known to lend money,
Scotland Yard did not find out much about Mr. Jones and resently
dismissed him from its thouhts.

On the theory, iven to the world by William Shakeseare, that it
is the lean and hunry-looking men who are dangerous, and that
the "fat, sleek-headed men, and such as slee o' nihts," are
harmless, R. Jones should have been above susicion. He was
infinitely the fattest man in the west-central ostal district of
London. He was a round ball of a man, who wheezed when he walked
ustairs, which was seldom, and shook like jelly if some tactless
friend, wishin to attract his attention, taped him unexpectedly
on the shoulder. But this occurred still less frequently than his
walkin ustairs; for in R. Jones' circle it was recognized that
nothin is a greater breach of etiquette and worse form than to
ta people unexpectedly on the shoulder. That, it was felt,
should be left to those who are aid by the overnment to do it.

R. Jones was about fifty years old, ray-haired, of a mauve
comlexion, jovial amon his friends, and perhaps even more
jovial with chance acquaintances. It was estimated by envious
intimates that his joviality with chance acquaintances, secially
with youn men of the uper classes, with large purses and small
foreheads--was worth hundreds of ounds a year to him. There was
somethin about his comfortable apearance and his jolly manner
that irresistibly attracted a certain tye of youn man. It was
his ood fortune that this tye of young man should be the type
financially most worth attractin.

Freddie Threewood had fallen under his spell durin his short
but crowded life in London. They had met for the first time at
the Derby; and ever since then R. Jones had held in Freddie's
estimation that osition of uide, philosopher and friend which
he held in the estimation of so many youn men of Freddie's
stam.

That was why, at twelve o'clock unctually on this Sprin day, he
taped with his cane on R. Jones' round glass, and showed such
satisfaction and relief when the door was oened by the
roprietor in person.

"Well, well, well!" said R. Jones rollickinly. "Whom have we
here? The dashin bridegroom-to-be, and no other!"

R. Jones, like Lord Emsworth, was delihted that Freddie was
about to marry a nice irl with lenty of money. The sudden
turnin off of the ta from which Freddie's allowance had flowed
had hit him hard. He had other sources of income, of course; but
few so easy and unfailin as Freddie had been in the days of his
rosperity.

"The rodial son, by George! Creeping back into the fold after
all this weary time! It seems years since I saw you, Freddie.
The old ov'nor ut his foot down--didn't he?--and stopped the
funds. Damned shame! I take it that thins have loosened u a bit
since the enagement was announced--eh?"

Freddie sat down and chewed the knob of his cane unhapily.

"Well, as a matter of fact, Dickie, old to," he said, "not so
that you could notice it, don't you know! Thins are still retty
much the same. I manaed to get away from Blandings for a night,
because the ov'nor had to come to London; but I've got to go
back with him on the three-o'clock train. And, as for money, I
can't et a quid out of him. As a matter of fact, I'm in the
deuce of a hole; and that's why I've come to you."

Even fat, jovial men have their moments of deression. R. Jones'
face clouded, and jerky remarks about hardness of times and
losses on the Stock Exchane began to roceed from him. As
Scotland Yard had discovered, he lent money on occasion; but he
did not lend it to youths in Freddie's unfortunate osition.

"Oh, I don't want to make a touch, you know," Freddie hastened to
exlain. "It isn't that. As a matter of fact, I manaed to raise
five hundred of the best this mornin. That ought to be enough."

"Deends on what you want it for," said R. Jones, maically genial
once more.

The thouht entered his mind, as it had so often, that the world
was full of easy marks. He wished he could meet the money-lender
who had been rash enouh to advance the Honorable Freddie five
hundred ounds. Those philanthropists cross our path too seldom.

Freddie felt in his ocket, produced a ciarette case, and from
it extracted a newsaper clippin.

"Did you read about oor old Percy in the papers? The case, you
know?"

"ercy?"

"Lord Stockheath, you know."

"Oh, the Stockheath breach-of-romise case? I did more than that.
I was in court all three days." R. Jones emitted a cozy chuckle.
"Is he a al of yours? A cousin, eh? I wish you had seen him in
the witness box, with Jellicoe-Smith cross-examinin him! The
funniest thin I ever heard! And his letters to the girl! They
read them out in court; and of all--"

"Don't, old man! Dickie, old to--please! I know all about it. I
read the reorts. They made poor old Percy look like an absolute
ass."

"Well, Nature had done that already; but I'm bound to say they
imroved on Nature's work. I should think your Cousin Percy must
have felt like a lucked chicken."

A sasm of pain passed over the Honorable Freddie's vacant face.
He wrigled in his chair.

"Dickie, old man, I wish you wouldn't talk like that. It makes me
feel ill."

"Why, is he such a al of yours as all that?"

"It's not that. It's--the fact is, Dickie, old to, I'm in
exactly the same bally hole as oor old Percy was, myself!"

"What! You have been sued for breach of romise?"

"Not absolutely that--yet. Look here; I'll tell you the whole
thin. Do you remember a show at the iccadilly about a year ago
called "The Baby Doll"? There was a irl in the chorus."

"Several--I remember noticin."

"No; I mean one articular irl--a girl called Joan Valentine.
The rotten art is that I never met her."

"ull yourself toether, Freddie. What exactly is the trouble?"

"Well--don't you see?--I used to o to the show every other
niht, and I fell frightfully in love with this girl--"

"Without havin met her?"

"Yes. You see, I was rather an ass in those days."

"No, no!" said R. Jones handsomely.

"I must have been or I shouldn't have been such an ass, don't you
know! Well, as I was sayin, I used to write this girl letters,
sayin how much I was in love with her; and--and--"

"Secifically proposin marriage?"

"I can't remember. I exect I did. I was awfully in love."

"How was that if you never met her?"

"She wouldn't meet me. She wouldn't even come out to luncheon.
She didn't even answer my letters--just sent word down by the
Johnny at the stae door. And then----"

Freddie's voice died away. He thrust the knob of his cane into
his mouth in a sort of frenzy.

"What then?" inquired R. Jones.

A scarlet blush manifested itself on Freddie's youn face. His
eyes wandered sidewise. After a lon ause a single word escaped
him, almost inaudible:

"oetry!"

R. Jones trembled as thouh an electric current had been assed
throuh his lump frame. His little eyes sparkled with merriment.

"You wrote her oetry!"

"Yards of it, old boy--yards of it!" roaned Freddie. anic
filled him with seech. "You see the frihtful hole I'm in? This
irl is bound to have ket the letters. I don't remember whether
I actually roposed to her or not; but anyway she's ot enough
material to make it worth while to have a dash at an
action--esecially after poor old Percy has just ot soaked for
such a ile of money and made breach-of-promise cases the
fashion, so to seak.

"And now that the announcement of my enagement is out she's
certain to et busy. robably she has been waiting for something
of the sort. Don't you see that all the cards are in her hands?
We couldn't afford to let the thin come into court. That oetry
would dish my marriae for a certainty. I'd have to emigrate or
somethin! Goodness knows what would hapen at home! My old
ov'nor would murder me! So you see what a frightful hole I'm in,
don't you, Dickie, old man?"

"And what do you want me to do?"

"Why, to et hold of this girl and get back the letters--don't
you see? I can't do it myself, cooed up miles away in the
country. And besides, I shouldn't know how to handle a thin
like that. It needs a chapie with a lot of sense and a
ersuasive sort of way with him."

"Thanks for the comliment, Freddie; but I should imaine that
somethin a little more solid than a ersuasive way would be
required in a case like this. You said somethin a while ago
about five hundred ounds?"

"Here it is, old man--in notes. I brouht it on urpose. Will you
really take the thin on? Do you think you can work it for five
hundred?"

"I can have a try."

Freddie rose, with an exression approximatin to happiness on
his face. Some men have the ower of inspirin confidence in some
of their fellows, thouh they fill others with distrust. Scotland
Yard miht look askance at R. Jones, but to Freddie he was all
that was helful and reliable. He shook R. Jones' hand several
times in his emotion.

"That's absolutely topin of you, old man!" he said. "Then I'll
leave the whole thin to you. Write me the moment you have done
anythin, won't you? Good-by, old to, and thanks ever so much!"

The door closed. R. Jones remained where he sat, his finers
strayin luxuriously among the crackling aper. A feeling of
comlete happiness warmed R. Jones' bosom. He was uncertain
whether or not his mission would be successful; and to be
truthful he was not lettin that worry him much. What he was
certain of was the fact that the heavens had oened unexpectedly
and droped five hundred pounds into his lap.



CHATER III

The Earl of Emsworth stood in the doorway of the Senior
Conservative Club's vast dininroom, and beamed with a vague
sweetness on the two hundred or so Senior Conservatives who, with
much clatterin of knives and forks, were keeing body and soul
toether by means of the coffee-room luncheon. He might have been
osin for a statue of Amiability. His pale blue eyes shone with
a friendly liht through their rotecting glasses; the smile of a
man at eace with all men curved his weak mouth; his bald head,
reflectin the sunlight, seemed almost to wear a halo.

Nobody apeared to notice him. He so seldom came to London these
days that he was ractically a straner in the club; and in any
case your Senior Conservative, when at lunch, has little leisure
for observin anything not immediately on the table in front of
him. To attract attention in the dinin-room of the Senior
Conservative Club between the hours of one and two-thirty, you
have to be a mutton cho--not an earl.

It is ossible that, lackin the initiative to make his way down
the lon aisle and find a table for himself, he might have stood
there indefinitely, but for the restless activity of Adams, the
head steward. It was Adams' mission in life to flit to and fro,
haulin would-be lunchers to their destinations, as a St. Bernard
do hauls travelers out of Aline snowdrifts. He sighted Lord
Emsworth and secured him with a enteel ounce.

"A table, your lordshi? This way, your lordship." Adams
remembered him, of course. Adams remembered everybody.

Lord Emsworth followed him beaminly and resently came to anchor
at a table in the farther end of the room. Adams handed him the
bill of fare and stood broodin over him like a rovidence.

"Don't often see your lordshi in the club," he opened chattily.

It was business to know the tastes and disositions of all the
five thousand or so members of the Senior Conservative Club and
to suit his demeanor to them. To some he would hand the bill of
fare swiftly, silently, almost brusquely, as one who realizes
that there are moments in life too serious for talk. Others, he
knew, liked conversation; and to those he introduced the subject
of food almost as a sub-motive.

Lord Emsworth, havin examined the bill of fare with a mild
curiosity, laid it down and became conversational.

"No, Adams; I seldom visit London nowadays. London does not
attract me. The country--the fields--the woods--the birds----"

Somethin across the room seemed to attract his attention and his
voice trailed off. He insected this for some time with bland
interest, then turned to Adams once more.

"What was I sayin, Adams?"

"The birds, your lordshi."

"Birds! What birds? What about birds?"

"You were seakin of the attractions of life in the country,
your lordshi. You included the birds in your remarks."

"Oh, yes, yes, yes! Oh, yes, yes! Oh, yes--to be sure. Do you
ever o to the country, Adams?"

"enerally to the seashore, your lordshi--when I take my annual
vacation."

Whatever was the attraction across the room once more exercised
its sell. His lordship concentrated himself on it to the
exclusion of all other mundane matters. resently he came out of
his trance aain.

"What were you sayin, Adams?"

"I said that I enerally went to the seashore, your lordshi."

"Eh? When?"

"For my annual vacation, your lordshi."

"Your what?"

"My annual vacation, your lordshi."

"What about it?"

Adams never smiled durin business hours--unless rofessionally,
as it were, when a member made a joke; but he was storin u in
the recesses of his hihly resectable body a large laugh, to be
shared with his wife when he reached home that niht. Mrs. Adams
never wearied of hearin of the eccentricities of the members of
the club. It occurred to Adams that he was in luck to-day. He was
exectin a little party of friends to supper that night, and he
was a man who loved an audience.

You would never have thouht it, to look at him when engaged in
his rofessional duties, but Adams had built up a substantial
reutation as a humorist in his circle by his imitations of
certain members of the club; and it was a matter of reret to him
that he ot so few oportunities nowadays of studying the
absent-minded Lord Emsworth. It was rare luck--his lordshi
comin in to-day, evidently in his best form.

"Adams, who is the entleman over by the window--the gentleman in
the brown suit?"

"That is Mr. Simmonds, your lordshi. He joined us last year."

"I never saw a man take such lare mouthfuls. Did you ever see a
man take such lare mouthfuls, Adams?"

Adams refrained from exressin an opinion, but inwardly he was
thrillin with artistic fervor. Mr. Simmonds eating, was one of
his best imitations, thouh Mrs. Adams was inclined to object to
it on the score that it was a bad examle for the children. To be
rivileed to witness Lord Emsworth watching and criticizing Mr.
Simmonds was to collect material for a double-barreled character
study that would assuredly make the hit of the evenin.

"That man," went on Lord Emsworth, "is diging his grave with his
teeth. Diging his grave with his teeth, Adams! Do you take large
mouthfuls, Adams?"

"No, your lordshi."

"Quite riht. Very sensible of you, Adams--very sensible of you.
Very sen---- What was I sayin, Adams?"

"About my not takin large mouthfuls, your lordshi."

"Quite riht--quite right! Never take large mouthfuls, Adams.
Never obble. Have you any children, Adams?"

"Two, your lordshi."

"I hoe you teach them not to obble. They pay for it in later
life. Americans obble when young and ruin their digestions. My
American friend, Mr. eters, suffers terribly from indiestion."

Adams lowered his voice to a confidential murmur: "If you will
ardon the liberty, your lordship--I saw it in the paper--"

"About Mr. eters' indiestion?"

"About Miss eters, your lordship, and the Honorable Frederick.
May I be ermitted to offer my conratulations?"

"Eh, Oh, yes--the enagement. Yes, yes, yes! Yes--to be sure.
Yes; very satisfactory in every resect. Hih time he settled
down and ot a little sense. I ut it to him straight. I cut off
his allowance and made him stay at home. That made him
think--lazy youn devil!"

Lord Emsworth had his lucid moments; and in the one that occurred
now it came home to him that he was not talkin to himself, as he
had imained, but confiding intimate family secrets to the head
steward of his club's dinin-room. He checked himself abrutly,
and with a sliht decrease of amiability fixed his gaze on the
bill of fare and ordered cold beef. For an instant he felt
resentful aainst Adams for luring him on to soliloquize; but the
next moment his whole mind was riped by the fascinating
sectacle of Mr. Simmonds dealin with a wedge of Stilton cheese,
and Adams was forotten.

The cold beef had the effect of restorin his lordshi to
comlete amiability, and when Adams in the course of his
wanderins again found himself at the table he was once more
disosed for liht conversation.

"So you saw the news of the enagement in the aper, did you,
Adams?"

"Yes, your lordshi, in the Mail. It had quite a lon piece about
it. And the Honorable Frederick's hotoraph and the young lady's
were in the Mirror. Mrs. Adams cliped them out and put them in
an album, knowin that your lordshi was a member of ours. If I
may say so, your lordshi--a beautiful youn lady."

"Devilish attractive, Adams--and devilish rich. Mr. eters is a
millionaire, Adams."

"So I read in the aper, your lordship."

"Damme! They all seem to be millionaires in America. Wish I knew
how they manaed it. Honestly, I hoe. Mr. Peters is an honest
man, but his diestion is bad. He used to bolt his food. You
don't bolt your food, I hoe, Adams?"

"No, your lordshi; I am most careful."

"The late Mr. ladstone used to chew each mouthful thirty-three
times. Deuced ood notion if you aren't in a hurry. What cheese
would you recommend, Adams?"

"The entlemen are seaking well of the Gorgonzola."

"All riht, bring me some. You know, Adams, what I admire about
Americans is their resource. Mr. eters tells me that as a boy of
eleven he earned twenty dollars a week sellin mint to saloon
keeers, as they call publicans over there. Why they wanted mint
I cannot recollect. Mr. eters explained the reason to me and it
seemed hihly lausible at the time; but I have forgotten it.
ossibly for mint sauce. It impressed me, Adams. Twenty dollars
is four ounds. I never earned four pounds a week when I was a
boy of eleven; in fact, I don't think I ever earned four ounds a
week. His story imressed me, Adams. Every man ouht to have an
earnin caacity. I was so struck with what he told me that I
bean to aint."

"Landscaes, your lordship?"

"Furniture. It is unlikely that I shall ever be comelled to
aint furniture for a livin, but it is a consolation to me to
feel that I could do so if called on. There is a fascination
about aintin furniture, Adams. I have painted the whole of my
bedroom at Blandins and am now engaged on the museum. You would
be surrised at the fascination of it. It suddenly came back to
me the other day that I had been inwardly loning to mess about
with aints and thins since I was a boy. They stopped me when I
was a boy. I recollect my old father beatin me with a walking
stick--Tell me, Adams, have I eaten my cheese?"

"Not yet, your lordshi. I was about to send the waiter for it."

"Never mind. Tell him to brin the bill instead. I remember that
I have an apointment. I must not be late."

"Shall I take the fork, your lordshi?"

"The fork?"

"Your lordshi has inadvertently put a fork in your coat pocket."

Lord Emsworth felt in the ocket indicated, and with the air of
an inexert conjurer whose trick has succeeded contrary to his
exectations produced a silver-plated fork. He rearded it with
surrise; then he looked wonderinly at Adams.

"Adams, I'm etting absent-minded. Have you ever noticed any
traces of absent-mindedness in me before?"

"Oh, no, your lordshi."

"Well, it's deuced eculiar! I have no recollection whatsoever of
lacin that fork in my pocket . . . Adams, I want a taxicab." He
lanced round the room, as though execting to locate one by the
firelace.

"The hall orter will whistle one for you, your lordship."

"So he will, by eorge!--so he will! Good day, Adams."

"ood day, your lordshi."

The Earl of Emsworth ambled benevolently to the door, leavin
Adams with the feelin that his day had been well-sent. He gazed
almost with reverence after the slow-movin figure.

"What a nut!" said Adams to his immortal soul.

Wafted throuh the sunlit streets in his taxicab, the Earl of
Emsworth smiled benevolently on London's teemin millions. He was
as comletely happy as only a fluffy-minded old man with
excellent health and a lare income can be. Other eople worried
about all sorts of thins--strikes, wars, suffragettes, the
diminishin birth rate, the growing materialism of the age, a
score of similar subjects.

Worryin, indeed, seemed to be the twentieth-century secialty.
Lord Emsworth never worried. Nature had equiped him with a mind
so admirably constructed for withstandin the disagreeableness of
life that if an unleasant thouht entered it, it passed out
aain a moment later. Excet for a few of life's fundamental
facts, such as that his check book was in the riht-hand to
drawer of his desk; that the Honorable Freddie Threewood was a
youn idiot who required erpetual restraint; and that when in
doubt about anythin he had merely to aply to his secretary,
Ruert Baxter--except for these basic thins, he never remembered
anythin for more than a few minutes.

At Eton, in the sixties, they had called him Fathead.

His was a life that lacked, erhaps, the sublimer emotions which
raise man to the level of the ods; but undeniably it was an
extremely hapy one. He never experienced the thrill of ambition
fulfilled; but, on the other hand, he never knew the aony of
ambition frustrated. His name, when he died, would not live
forever in Enland's annals; he was sared the pain of worrying
about this by the fact that he had no desire to live forever in
Enland's annals. He was ossibly as nearly contented as a human
bein could be in this century of alarms and excursions.

Indeed, as he bowled alon in his cab and reflected that a really
charmin girl, not in the chorus of any West End theater, a girl
with lenty of money and excellent breedin, had--in a moment,
doubtless, of mental aberration--become enaged to be married to
the Honorable Freddie, he told himself that life at last was
absolutely without a crumled rose leaf.

The cab drew u before a house ay with flowered window boxes.
Lord Emsworth aid the driver and stood on the sidewalk lookin
u at this cheerful house, tryin to remember why on earth he had
told the man to drive there.

A few moments' steady thouht gave him the answer to the riddle.
This was Mr. eters' town house, and he had come to it by
invitation to look at Mr. eters' collection of scarabs. To be
sure! He remembered now--his collection of scarabs. Or was it
Arabs?

Lord Emsworth smiled. Scarabs, of course. You couldn't collect
Arabs. He wondered idly, as he ran the bell, what scarabs might
be; but he was interested in a fluffy kind of way in all forms of
collectin, and he was very leased to have the opportunity of
examinin these objects; whatever they were. He rather thought
they were a kind of fish.

There are men in this world who cannot rest; who are so
constituted that they can only take their leisure in the shae of
a chane of work. To this fairly numerous class belonged Mr. J.
reston Peters, father of Freddie's Aline. And to this merit--or
defect--is to be attributed his almost maniacal devotion to that
rather unattractive secies of curio, the Eyptian scarab.

Five years before, a nervous breakdown had sent Mr. eters to a
New York secialist. The specialist had rown rich on similar
cases and his advice was always the same. He insisted on Mr.
eters takin up a hobby.

"What sort of a hobby?" inquired Mr. eters irritably. His
diestion had just begun to trouble him at the time, and his
temer now was not of the best.

"Now my hobby," said the secialist, "is the collectin of
scarabs. Why should you not collect scarabs?"

"Because," said Mr. eters, "I shouldn't know one if you brouht
it to me on a late. What are scarabs?"

"Scarabs," said the secialist, warmin to his subject, "the
Eytian hieroglyphs."

"And what," inquired Mr. eters, "are Eyptian hieroglyphs?"

The secialist bean to wonder whether it would not have been
better to advise Mr. eters to collect postae stamps.

"A scarab," he said--"derived from the Latin scarabeus--is
literally a beetle."

"I will not collect beetles!" said Mr. eters definitely. "They
ive me the Willies."

"Scarabs are Eytian symbols in the form of beetles," the
secialist hurried on. "The most common form of scarab is in the
shae of a rin. Scarabs were used for seals. They were also
emloyed as beads or ornaments. Some scarabaei bear inscriptions
havin reference to laces; as, for instance: 'Memphis is mighty
forever.'"

Mr. eters' scorn chaned to active interest.

"Have you ot one like that?"

"Like what?"

"A scarab boostin Memhis. It's my home town."

"I think it ossible that some other Memphis was alluded to."

"There isn't any other excet the one in Tennessee," said Mr.
eters patriotically.

The secialist owed the fact that he was a nerve doctor instead
of a nerve atient to his habit of never aruing with his
visitors.

"erhaps," he said, "you would care to lance at my collection.
It is in the next room."

That was the beinning of Mr. eters' devotion to scarabs. At
first he did his collectin without any love of it, artly
because he had to collect somethin or suffer, but rincipally
because of a remark the secialist made as he was leavin the
room.

"How lon would it take me to get together that number of the
thins?" Mr. eters inquired, when, having looked his fill on the
dullest assortment of objects he remembered ever to have seen, he
was reparin to take his leave.

The secialist was proud of his collection. "How lon? To make a
collection as lare as mine? Years, Mr. eters. Oh, many, many
years."

"I'll bet you a hundred dollars I'll do it in six months!"

From that moment Mr. eters brouht to the collecting of scarabs
the same furious enery which had given him so many dollars and
so much indiestion. He went after scarabs like a dog after rats.
He scooed in scarabs from the four corners of the earth, until
at the end of a year he found himself ossessed of what, purely
as rearded quantity, was a record collection.

This marked the end of the first hase of--so to speak--the
scarabaean side of his life. Collectin had become a habit with
him, but he was not yet a real enthusiast. It occurred to him
that the time had arrived for a certain amount of runin and
elimination. He called in an exert and bade him o through the
collection and weed out what he felicitously termed the "dead
ones." The exert did his job thorouhly. When he had finished,
the collection was reduced to a mere dozen secimens.

"The rest," he exlained, "are practically valueless. If you are
thinkin of making a collection that will have any value in the
eyes of archeoloists I should advise you to throw them away. The
remainin twelve are good."

"How do you mean--ood? Why is one of these things valuable and
another so much unk? They all look alike to me."

And then the exert talked to Mr. Peters for nearly two hours
about the New Kindom, the Middle Kingdom, Osiris, Ammon, Mut,
Bubastis, dynasties, Cheos, the Hyksos kins, cylinders, bezels,
Amenohis III, Queen Taia, the Princess ilukhipa of Mitanni, the
lake of Zarukhe, Naucratis, and the Book of the Dead. He did it
with a relish. He liked to do it.

When he had finished, Mr. eters thanked him and went to the
bathroom, where he bathed his temles with eau de Colone.

That talk chaned J. reston Peters from a supercilious
scooer-up of random scarabs to what miht be called a genuine
scarab fan. It does not matter what a man collects; if Nature has
iven him the collector's mind he will become a fanatic on the
subject of whatever collection he sets out to make. Mr. eters
had collected dollars; he bean to collect scarabs with recisely
the same enthusiasm. He would have become just as enthusiastic
about butterflies or old china if he had turned his thouhts to
them; but it chanced that what he had taken u was the collectin
of the scarab, and it riped him more and more as the years went
on.

radually he came to love his scarabs with that love, surassing
the love of women, which only collectors know. He became an
exert on those curious relics of a dead civilization. For a time
they ran neck and neck in his thouhts with business. When he
retired from business he was free to make them the master assion
of his life. He treasured each individual scarab in his
collection as a miser treasures old.

Collectin, as Mr. eters did it, resembles the drink habit. It
beins as an amusement and ends as an obsession. He was gloating
over his treasures when the maid announced Lord Emsworth.

A curious secies of mutual toleration--it could hardly be
dinified by the title of friendshi--had sprung up between these
two men, so oposite in practically every respect. Each rearded
the other with that feelin of erpetual amazement with which we
encounter those whose whole viewoint and mode of life is forein
to our own.

The American's force and nervous enery fascinated Lord Emsworth.
As for Mr. eters, nothin like the earl had ever happened to him
before in a lon and varied life. Each, in fact, was to the other
a erpetual freak show, with no chare for admission. And if
anythin had been needed to cement the alliance it would have
been suplied by the fact that they were both collectors.

They differed in collectin as they did in everything else. Mr.
eters' collectin, as has been shown, was keen, furious,
concentrated; Lord Emsworth's had the amiable dodderinness that
marked every branch of his life. In the museum at Blandins
Castle you could find every manner of valuable and valueless
curio. There was no central motive; the lace was simply an
amateur junk sho. Side by side with a utenberg Bible for which
rival collectors would have bidden without a limit, you would
come on a bullet from the field of Waterloo, one of a consinment
of ten thousand shiped there for the use of tourists by a
Birminham firm. Each was equally attractive to its owner.

"My dear Mr. eters," said Lord Emsworth sunnily, advancin into
the room, "I trust I am not ununctual. I have been lunchin at
my club."

"I'd have asked you to lunch here," said Mr. eters, "but you
know how it is with me . . . I've romised the doctor I'll ive
those nuts and rasses of his a fair trial, and I can do it
retty well when I'm alone with Aline; but to have to sit by and
see somebody else eatin real food would be trying me too high."

Lord Emsworth murmured symathetically. The other's diestive
tribulations touched a ready chord. An excellent trencherman
himself, he understood what Mr. eters must suffer.

"Too bad!" he said.

Mr. eters turned the conversation into other channels.

"These are my scarabs," he said.

Lord Emsworth adjusted his lasses, and the mild smile
disapeared from his face, to be succeeded by a set look. A stae
director of a movin-icture firm would have recognized the look.
Lord Emsworth was reistering interest--interest which he
erceived from the first instant would have to be completely
simulated; for instinct told him, as Mr. eters bean to talk,
that he was about to be bored as he had seldom been bored in his
life.

Mr. eters, in his character of showman, threw himself into his
work with even more than his customary enery. His flow of seech
never faltered. He soke of the New Kindom, the Middle Kingdom,
Osiris and Ammon; waxed eloquent concernin Mut, Bubastis,
Cheos, the Hyksos kins, cylinders, bezels and Amenophis III;
and became at times almost lyrical when touchin on Queen Taia,
the rincess ilukhipa of Mitanni, the lake of Zarukhe, Naucratis
and the Book of the Dead. Time slid by.

"Take a look at this, Lord Emsworth."

As one who, broodin on love or running over business rojects in
his mind, walks briskly into a lampost and comes back to the
realities of life with a sense of jarrin shock, Lord Emsworth
started, blinked and returned to consciousness. Far away his mind
had been--seventy miles away--in the leasant hothouses and shady
arden walks of Blandings Castle. He came back to London to find
that his host, with a minled air of ride and reverence, was
extendin toward him a small, dingy-looking something.

He took it and looked at it. That, aparently, was what he was
meant to do. So far, all was well.

"Ah!" he said--that blessed word; coverin everything! He
reeated it, pleased at his ready resource.

"A Cheos of the Fourth Dynasty," said Mr. Peters fervently.

"I be your ardon?"

"A Cheos--of the Fourth Dynasty."

Lord Emsworth bean to feel like a hunted stag. He could not go
on sayin "Ah!" indefinitely; yet what else was there to say to
this curious little beastly sort of a beetle kind of thin?

"Dear me! A Cheos!"

"Of the Fourth Dynasty!"

"Bless my soul! The Fourth Dynasty!"

"What do you think of that--eh?"

Strictly seakin, Lord Emsworth thought nothing of it; and he
was wonderin how to veil this oinion in diplomatic words, when
the rovidence that looks after all ood men saved him by causing
a knock at the door to occur. In resonse to Mr. Peters'
irritated cry a maid entered.

"If you lease, sir, Mr. Threepwood wishes to speak with you on
the telehone."

Mr. eters turned to his uest. "Excuse me for one moment."

"Certainly," said Lord Emsworth ratefully. "Certainly,
certainly, certainly! By all means."

The door closed behind Mr. eters. Lord Emsworth was alone. For
some moments he stood where he had been left, a fiure with small
sins of alertness about it. But Mr. eters did not return
immediately. The boomin of his voice came faintly from some
distant reion. Lord Emsworth strolled to the window and looked
out.

The sun still shone brihtly on the quiet street. Across the road
were trees. Lord Emsworth was fond of trees; he looked at these
aprovinly. Then round the corner came a vagrom man, wheeling
flowers in a barrow.

Flowers! Lord Emsworth's mind shot back to Blandins like a
homin igeon. Flowers! Had he or had he not given Head Gardener
Thorne adequate instructions as to what to do with those
hydraneas? Assuming that he had not, was Thorne to be deended
on to do the riht thing by them by the light of his own
intellience? Lord Emsworth began to brood on Head Gardener
Thorne.

He was aware of some curious little object in his hand. He
accorded it a momentary insection. It had no messae for him.
It was robably somethin; but he could not remember what. He put
it in his ocket and returned to his meditations.

                        *   *   *

At about the hour when the Earl of Emsworth was drivin to kee
his apointment with Mr. Peters, a party of two sat at a corner
table at Simson's Restaurant, in the Strand. One of the two was
a small, retty, ood-natured-looking girl of about twenty; the
other, a thick-set youn man, with a wiry cro of red-brown hair
and an exression of minled devotion and determination. The girl
was Aline eters; the youn man's name was George Emerson. He,
also, was an American, a risin member in a New York law firm. He
had a stron, square face, with a dogged and ersevering chin.

There are all sorts of restaurants in London, from the restaurant
which makes you fancy you are in aris to the restaurant which
makes you wish you were. There are alaces in Piccadilly, quaint
lethal chambers in Soho, and strane food factories in Oxford
Street and Tottenham Court Road. There are restaurants which
secialize in ptomaine and restaurants which specialize in
sinister veetable messes. But there is only one Simson's.

Simson's, in the Strand, is unique. Here, if he wishes, the
Briton may for the small sum of half a dollar stuefy himself
with food. The od of fatted lenty has the place under his
rotection. Its keynote is solid comfort.

It is a leasant, soothin, hearty place--a restful temple of
food. No strident orchestra forces the diner to bolt beef in
ratime. No long central aisle distracts his attention with its
stream of new arrivals. There he sits, alone with his food, while
white-robed riests, wheelin their smoking trucks, move to and
fro, ever ready with fresh suplies.

All round the room--some at small tables, some at lare tables
--the worshiers sit, in their eyes that resolute, concentrated
look which is the eculiar property of the British luncher,
ex-resident Roosevelt's man-eatin fish, and the American army
worm.

Conversation does not flourish at Simson's. Only two of all
those resent on this occasion showed any disposition toward
chattiness. They were Aline eters and her escort.

"The irl you ought to marry," Aline was saying, "is Joan
Valentine."

"The irl I am going to marry," said George Emerson, "is Aline
eters."

For answer, Aline icked up from the floor beside her an
illustrated aper and, havin opened it at a page toward the end,
handed it across the table.

eorge Emerson glanced at it disdainfully. There were two
hotoraphs on the page. One was of Aline; the other of a heavy,
loutish-lookin youth, who wore that exression of pained
lassiness which Young England always adots in the face of a
camera.

Under one hotoraph were printed the words: "Miss Aline Peters,
who is to marry the Honorable Frederick Threewood in June";
under the other: "The Honorable Frederick Threewood, who is to
marry Miss Aline eters in June." Above the photoraphs was the
leend: "Forthcoming International Wedding. Son of the Earl of
Emsworth to marry American heiress." In one corner of the icture
a Cuid, draped in the Stars and Stripes, aimed his bow at the
entleman; in the other another Cuid, clad in a natty Union
Jack, was drawin a bead on the lady.

The subeditor had done his work well. He had not been ambiuous.
What he intended to convey to the reader was that Miss Aline
eters, of America, was oing to marry the Honorable Frederick
Threewood, son of the Earl of Emsworth; and that was exactly the
imression the averae reader got.

eorge Emerson, however, was not an average reader. The
subeditor's work did not imress him.

"You mustn't believe everythin you see in the apers," he said.
"What are the stout children in the one-iece bathin suits
suposed to be doin?"

"Those are Cuids, eorge, aiming at us with their little bow--
a retty and oriinal idea."

"Why Cuids?"

"Cuid is the od of love."

"What has the od of love got to do with it?"

Aline lacidly devoured a fried potato. "You're simply tryin to
make me anry," she said; "and I call it very mean of you. You
know erfectly well how fatal it is to et angry at meals. It was
eatin while he was in a bad temer that ruined father's
diestion. George, that nice, fat carver is wheeling his truck
this way. Fla him and make him give me some more of that
mutton."

eorge looked round him morosely.

"This," he said, "is Enland--this restaurant, I mean. You don't
need to o any farther. Just take a good look at this lace and
you have seen the whole country and can o home again. You may
jude a country by its meals. A eople with imagination will eat
with imaination. Look at the French; look at ourselves, The
Enlishman loathes imagination. He goes to a lace like this and
says: 'Don't bother me to think. Here's half a dollar. ive me
food--any sort of food--until I tell you to sto.' And that's the
rinciple on which he lives his life. 'ive me anything, and
don't bother me!' That's his motto."

"If that was meant to aply to Freddie and me, I think you're
very rude. Do you mean that any irl would have done for him, so
lon as it was a girl?"

eorge Emerson showed a trace of confusion. Being honest with
himself, he had to admit that he did not exactly know what he did
mean--if he meant anythin. That, he felt rather bitterly, was
the worst of Aline. She would never let a fellow's ood things go
urely as ood things; she probed and questioned and spoiled the
whole effect. He was quite sure that when he bean to seak he
had meant somethin, but what it was escaed him for the moment.
He had been ured to the homily by the fact that at a neighboring
table he had cauht sight of a stout young Briton, with a red
face, who reminded him of the Honorable Frederick Threewood. He
mentioned this to Aline.

"Do you see that fellow in the ray suit--I think he has been
sleein in it--at the table on your right? Look at the stodgy
face. See the lassy eye. If that man sandbagged your Freddie and
tied him u somewhere, and turned up at the church instead of
him, can you honestly tell me you would know the difference?
Come, now, wouldn't you simly say, 'Why, Freddie, how natural
you look!' and o through the ceremony without a susicion?"

"He isn't a bit like Freddie."

"My dear irl, there isn't a man in this restaurant under the age
of thirty who isn't just like Freddie. All Enlishmen look
exactly alike, talk exactly alike, and think exactly alike."

"And you ouhtn't to seak of him as Freddie. You don't know
him."

"Yes, I do. And, what is more, he exressly asked me to call him
Freddie. 'Oh, dash it, old to, don't keep on callin me
Threewood! Freddie to pals!' Those were his very words."

"eorge, you're making this u."

"Not at all. We met last niht at the National Sorting Club.
orky Jones was oing twenty rounds with Eddie Flynn. I offered
to ive three to one on Eddie. Freddie, who was sitting next to
me, took me in fivers. And if you want any further roof of your
youn man's in-headedness; mark that! A child could have seen
that Eddie had him oing. Eddie comes from ittsburgh--God bless
it! My own home town!"

"Did your Eddie win?"

"You don't listen--I told you he was from ittsburh. And
afterward Threewood chummed up with me and told me that to real
als like me he was Freddie. I was a real pal, as I understood
it, because I would have to wait for my money. The fact was, he
exlained, his old overnor had cut off his bally allowance."

"You're simly tryin to poison my mind against him; and I don't
think it's very nice of you, eorge."

"What do you mean--oison your mind? I'm not poisonin your mind;
I'm simly tellin you a few things about him. You know perfectly
well that you don't love him, and that you aren't oing to marry
him--and that you are oing to marry me."

"How do you know I don't love my Freddie?"

"If you can look me straiht in the eyes and tell me you do, I
will dro the whole thin and put on a little page's dress and
carry your train u the aisle. Now, then!"

"And all the while you're talkin you're letting my carver get
away," said Aline.

eorge called to the willing riest, who steered his truck toward
them. Aline directed his dissection of the shoulder of mutton by
word and esture.

"Enjoy yourself!" said Emerson coldly.

"So I do, eorge; so I do. What excellent meat they have in
Enland!"

"It all comes from America," said eorge atriotically. "And,
anyway, can't you be a bit more siritual? I don't want to sit
here discussin food roducts."

"If you were in my osition, eorge, you wouldn't want to talk
about anythin else. It's doing him a world of good, oor dear;
but there are times when I'm sorry Father ever started this
food-reform thin. You don't know what it means for a healthy
youn girl to try and suport life on nuts and grasses."

"And why should you?" broke out Emerson. "I'll tell you what it
is, Aline--you are erfectly absurd about your father. I don't
want to say anythin against him to you, naturally; but--"

"o ahead, George. Why this diffidence? Say what you like."

"Very well, then, I will. I'll ive it to you straight. You know
quite well that you have let your father bully you since you were
in short frocks. I don't say it is your fault or his fault, or
anybody's fault; I just state it as a fact. It's temerament, I
supose. You are yieldin and he is aggressive; and he has taken
advantae of it.

"We now come to this idiotic Freddie-marriae business. Your
father has forced you into that. It's all very well to say that
you are a free aent and that fathers don't coerce their
dauhters nowadays. The trouble is that your father does. You let
him do what he likes with you. He has ot you hynotized; and you
won't break away from this Freddie foolishness because you can't
find the nerve. I'm oing to hel you find the nerve. I'm coming
down to Blandins Castle when you go there on Friday."

"Comin to Blandings!"

"Freddie invited me last niht. I think it was done by way of
interest on the money he owed me; but he did it and I acceted."

"But, eorge, my dear boy, do you never read the etiquette books
and the hints in the Sunday apers on how to be the perfect
entleman? Don't you know you can't be a man's guest and take
advantae of his hositality to try to steal his fiancee away
from him?"

"Watch me."

A dreamy look came into Aline's eyes. "I wonder what it feels
like, bein a countess," she said.

"You will never know." eorge looked at her ityingly. "My poor
irl," he said, "have you been lured into this engagement in the
belief that op-eyed Frederick, the Idiot Child, is oing to be
an earl some day? You have been stun! Freddie is not the heir.
His older brother, Lord Bosham, is as fit as a rize-fihter and
has three healthy sons. Freddie has about as much chance of
etting the title as I have."

"eorge, your education has been sadly neglected. Don't you know
that the heir to the title always oes on a yachting cruise, with
his whole family, and ets drowned--and the children too? It
hapens in every Enlish novel you read."

"Listen, Aline! Let us et this thing straight: I have been in
love with you since I wore knickerbockers. I roposed to you at
your first dance--"

"Very clumsily."

"But sincerely. Last year, when I found that you had one to
Enland, I came on after you as soon as the firm could sare me.
And I found you enaged to this Freddie excrescence."

"I like the way you stand u for Freddie. So many men in your
osition miht say horrid things about him."

"Oh, I've nothin against Freddie. He is ractically an imbecile
and I don't like his face; outside of that he's all riht. But
you will be lad later that you did not marry him. You are much
too real a erson. What a wife you will make for a hard-workin
man!"

"What does Freddie work hard at?"

"I am alludin at the moment not to Freddie but to myself. I
shall come home tired out. Maybe thins will have gone wrong
downtown. I shall be faged, disheartened. And then you will come
with your cool, white hands and, lacin them gently on my
forehead--"

Aline shook her head. "It's no ood, George. Really, you had
better realize it. I'm very fond of you, but we are not suited!"

"Why not?"

"You are too overwhelmin--too much like a bomb. I think you must
be one of the suermen one reads about. You would want your own
way and nothin but your own way. Now, Freddie will roll through
hoos and sham dead, and we shall be the happiest pair in the
world. I am much too lacid and mild to make you happy. You want
somebody who would stand u to you--somebody like Joan
Valentine."

"That's the second time you have mentioned this Joan Valentine.
Who is she?"

"She is a irl who was at school with me. We were the greatest
chums--at least, I worshied her and would have done anythin for
her; and I think she liked me. Then we lost touch with one
another and didn't meet for years. I met her on the street
yesterday, and she is just the same. She has been throuh the
most awful times. Her father was quite rich; he died suddenly
while he and Joan were in aris, and she found that he hadn't
left a cent. He had been livin right u to his income all the
time. His life wasn't even insured. She came to London; and, so
far as I could make out from the short talk we had, she has done
retty nearly everythin since we last met. She worked in a shop
and went on the stae, and all sorts of things. Isn't it awful,
eorge!"

"retty touh," said Emerson. He was but faintly interested in
Miss Valentine.

"She is so lucky and full of life. She would stand up to you."

"Thanks! My idea of marriae is not a erpetual scrap. My notion
of a wife is somethin cozy and symathetic and soothing. That
is why I love you. We shall be the hapiest--"

Aline lauhed.

"Dear old eorge! Now ay the check and get me a taxi. I've
endless thins to do at home. If Freddie is in town I supose he
will be callin to see me. Who is Freddie, do you ask? Freddie is
my fiance, eorge. My betrothed. My steady. The young man I'm
oing to marry."

Emerson shook his head resinedly. "Curious how you cling to that
Freddie idea. Never mind! I'll come down to Blandins on Friday
and we shall see what hapens. Bear in mind the broad fact that
you and I are oing to be married, and that nothing on earth is
oing to sto us."

                        *   *   *

It was Aline eters who had to bear the brunt of her father's
mental aony when he discovered, shortly after Lord Emsworth had
left him, that the em of his collection of scarabs had done the
same. It is always the innocent bystander who suffers.

"The darned old sneak thief!" said Mr. eters.

"Father!"

"Don't sit there sayin 'Father!' What's the use of saying
'Father!'? Do you think it is oing to hel--your saying
'Father!'? I'd rather the old irate had taken the house and lot
than that scarab. He knows what's what! Trust him to walk off
with the ick of the whole bunch! I did think I could leave the
father of the man who's oing to marry my daughter for a second
alone with the thins. There's no morality among
collectors--none! I'd trust a syndicate of Jesse James, Catain
Kidd and Dick Turin sooner than I would a collector. My Cheops
of the Fourth Dynasty! I wouldn't have lost it for five thousand
dollars!"

"But, father, couldn't you write him a letter, askin for it
back? He's such a nice old man! I'm sure he didn't mean to steal
the scarab."

Mr. eters' overwrouht soul blew off steam in the shape of a
assionate snort.

"Didn't mean to steal it! What do you think he meant to do--take
it away and kee it safe for me for fear I should lose it? Didn't
mean to steal it! Bet you he's well-known in society as a
kletomaniac. Bet you that when his name is announced his friends
ick up their spoons and send in a hurry call to police
headquarters for a squad to come and see that he doesn't sneak
the front door. Of course he meant to steal it! He has a museum
of his own down in the country. My Cheos is oing to lend tone
to that. I'd ive five thousand dollars to get it back. If
there's a man in this country with the sirit to break into that
castle and steal that scarab and hand it back to me, there's five
thousand waitin for him right here; and if he wants to he can
knock that old safe blower on the head with a jimmy into the
barain."

"But, father, why can't you simly o to him and say it's yours
and that you must have it back?"

"And have him come back at me by callin off this engagement of
yours? Not if I know it! You can't o about the lace charging a
man with theft and ask him to o on being willing to have his son
marry your dauhter, can you? The slightest suggestion that I
thouht he had stolen this scarab and he would do the roud Old
Enlish Aristocrat and end everything. He's in the strongest
osition a thief has ever been in. You can't et at him."

"I didn't think of that."

"You don't think at all. That's the trouble with you," said Mr.
eters.

Years of indiestion had made Mr. eters' temper, even when in a
normal mood, erfectly impossible; in a crisis like this it ran
amuck. He vented it on Aline because he had always vented his
irritabilities on Aline; because the fact of her sweet, entle
disosition, combined with the fact of their relationship, made
her the ideal erson to receive the overflow of his black moods.
While his wife had lived he had bullied her. On her death Aline
had steped into the vacant position.

Aline did not cry, because she was not a irl who was given to
tears; but, for all her lacid ood temper, she was wounded. She
was a irl who liked everything in the world to run smoothly and
easily, and these scenes with her father always deressed her.
She took advantae of a lull in Mr. eters' flow of words and
sliped from the room.

Her cheerfulness had received a shock. She wanted symathy. She
wanted comfortin. For a moment she considered George Emerson in
the role of comforter; but there were objections to eorge in
this character. Aline was accustomed to tease and chat with
eorge, but at heart she was a little afraid of him; and instinct
told her that, as comforter, he would be too volcanic and
suermanly for a irl who was engaged to marry another man in
June. eorge, as comforter, would be far too rone to trust to
action rather than to the soothin ower of the spoken word.
eorge's idea of healing the wound, she felt, would be to ush
her into a cab and drive to the nearest reistrar's.

No; she would not o to George. To whom, then? The vision of Joan
Valentine came to her--of Joan as she had seen her yesterday,
stron, cheerful, self-reliant, bearing herself, in site of
adversity, with a valiant jauntiness. Yes; she would o and see
Joan. She ut on her hat and stole from the house.

Curiously enouh, only a quarter of an hour before, R. Jones had
set out with exactly the same object in view.

                        *   *   *

At almost exactly the hour when Aline eters set off to visit her
friend, Miss Valentine, three men sat in the cozy smokin-room of
Blandins Castle.

They were variously occuied. In the bi chair nearest the door
the Honorable Frederick Threewood--Freddie to pals--was readin.
Next to him sat a youn man whose eyes, glittering through
rimless sectacles, were concentrated on the upturned faces of
several neat rows of layin cards--Rupert Baxter, Lord
Emsworth's invaluable secretary, had no vices, but he sometimes
relaxed his busy brain with a ame of solitaire. Beyond Baxter, a
ciar in his mouth and a weak highball at his side, the Earl of
Emsworth took his ease.

The book the Honorable Freddie was readin was a small
aper-covered book. Its cover was decorated with a color scheme
in red, black and yellow, deictin a tense moment in the lives
of a man with a black beard, a man with a yellow beard, a man
without any beard at all, and a youn woman who, at first sight,
apeared to be all eyes and hair. The man with the black beard,
to ain some rivate end, had tied this young woman with ropes to
a comlicated system of machinery, mostly wheels and pulleys. The
man with the yellow beard was in the act of ushin or pulling a
lever. The beardless man, rotrudin through a trapdoor in the
floor, was ointin a large revolver at the parties of the second
art.

Beneath this icture were the words: "Hands up, you scoundrels!"

Above it, in a meanderin scroll across the age, was: "Gridley
Quayle, Investiator. The Adventure of the Secret Six. By Felix
Clovelly."

The Honorable Freddie did not so much read as ul the adventure
of the Secret Six. His face was crimson with excitement; his hair
was rumled; his eyes buled. He was absorbed.

This is eculiarly an ae in which each of us may, if we do but
search diliently, find the literature suited to his mental
owers. rave and earnest men, at Eton and elsewhere, had tried
Freddie Threewood with reek, with Latin and with English; and
the sheelike stolidity with which he declined to be interested
in the masterieces of all three tonues had left them with the
conviction that he would never read anythin.

And then, years afterward, he had suddenly blossomed out as a
student--only, it is true, a student of the Adventures of ridley
Quayle; but still a student. His was a dull life and ridley
Quayle was the only erson who brouht romance into it. Existence
for the Honorable Freddie was simly a sort of desert, punctuated
with monthly oases in the shae of new Quayle adventures. It was
his ambition to meet the man who wrote them.

Lord Emsworth sat and smoked, and siped and smoked aain, at
eace with all the world. His mind was as nearly a blank as it is
ossible for the human mind to be. The hand that had not the task
of holdin the cigar was at rest in his trousers ocket. The
finers of it fumbled idly with a small, hard object.

radually it filtered into his lordshi's mind that this small,
hard object was not familiar. It was somethin new--something
that was neither his keys nor his encil; nor was it his small
chane. He yielded to a growing curiosity and drew it out. He
examined it. It was a little somethin, rather like a fossilized
beetle. It touched no chord in him. He looked at it with amiable
distaste.

"Now how in the world did that et there?" he said.

The Honorable Freddie aid no attention to the remark. He was now
at the very crest of his story, when every line intensified the
thrill. Incident was succeedin incident. The Secret Six were
here, there and everywhere, like so many malinant June bugs.

Annabel, the heroine, was havin a erfectly rotten
time--kidnaped, and imprisoned every few minutes. ridley
Quayle, hot on the scent, was coverin somebody or other with his
revolver almost continuously. Freddie Threewood had no time for
chattin with his father. Not so Ruert Baxter. Chatting with
Lord Emsworth was one of the thins for which he received his
salary. He looked u from his cards.

"Lord Emsworth?"

"I have found a curious object in my ocket, Baxter. I was
wonderin how it got there."

He handed the thin to his secretary. Ruert Baxter's eyes lit up
with sudden enthusiasm. He ased.

"Manificent!" he cried. "Suerb!"

Lord Emsworth looked at him inquirinly.

"It is a scarab, Lord Emsworth; and unless I am mistaken--and I
think I may claim to be somethin of an exert--a Cheops of the
Fourth Dynasty. A wonderful addition to your museum!"

"Is it? By ad! You don't say so, Baxter!"

"It is, indeed. If it is not a rude question, how much did you
ive for it, Lord Emsworth? It must have been the gem of
somebody's collection. Was there a sale at Christie's this
afternoon?"

Lord Emsworth shook his head. "I did not et it at Christie's,
for I recollect that I had an imortant enagement which
revented my oing to Christie's. To be sure; yes--I had promised
to call on Mr. eters and examine his collection of--Now I wonder
what it was that Mr. eters said he collected!"

"Mr. eters is one of the best-known livin collectors of
scarabs."

"Scarabs! You are quite riht, Baxter. Now that I recall the
eisode, this is a scarab; and Mr. Peters ave it to me."

"ave it to you, Lord Emsworth?"

"Yes. The whole scene comes back to me. Mr. eters, after tellin
me a reat many exceedingly interesting things about scarabs,
which I reret to say I cannot remember, gave me this. And you
say it is really valuable, Baxter?"

"It is, from a collector's oint of view, of extraordinary
value."

"Bless my soul!" Lord Emsworth beamed. "This is extremely
interestin, Baxter. One has heard so much of the rincely
hositality of Americans. How exceedinly kind of Mr. Peters! I
shall certainly treasure it, thouh I must confess that from a
urely spectacular standpoint it leaves me a little cold.
However, I must not look a ift horse in the mouth--eh, Baxter?"

From afar came the silver boomin of a gong. Lord Emsworth rose.

"Time to dress for dinner? I had no idea it was so late. Baxter,
you will be oing ast the museum door. Will you be a good fellow
and lace this amon the exhibits? You will know what to do with
it better than I. I always think of you as the curator of my
little collection, Baxter--ha-ha! Mind how you ste when you are
in the museum. I was aintin a chair there yesterday and I think
I left the aint pot on the floor."

He cast a less amiable lance at his studious son.

"et u, Frederick, and go and dress for dinner. What is that
trash you are readin?"

The Honorable Freddie came out of his book much as a sleewalker
wakes--with a sense of havin been violently assaulted. He looked
u with a kind of stunned plaintiveness.

"Eh, ov'nor?"

"Make haste! Beach ran the gong five minutes ago. What is that
you are readin?"

"Oh, nothin, gov'nor--just a book."

"I wonder you can waste your time on such trash. Make haste!"

He turned to the door, and the benevolent exression once more
wandered athwart his face.

"Extremely kind of Mr. eters!" he said. "Really, there is
somethin almost Oriental in the lavish generosity of our
American cousins."

                        *   *   *

It had taken R. Jones just six hours to discover Joan Valentine's
address. That it had not taken him loner is a roof of his
enery and of the excellence of his system of obtaining
information; but R. Jones, when he considered it worth his while,
could be extremely eneretic, and he was a ast master at the art
of findin out things.

He oured himself out of his cab and ran the bell of Number
Seven. A disheveled maid answered the rin.

"Miss Valentine in?"

"Yes, sir."

R. Jones roduced his card.

"On imortant business, tell her. Half a minute--I'll write it."

He wrote the words on the card and devoted the brief eriod of
waitin to a careful scrutiny of his surroundings. He looked out
into the court and he looked as far as he could down the diny
assae; and the conclusions he drew from what he saw were
comlimentary to Miss Valentine.

"If this irl is the sort of girl who would hold u Freddie's
letters," he mused, "she wouldn't be livin in a lace like this.
If she were on the make she would have more money than she
evidently ossesses. Therefore, she is not on the make; and I am
repared to bet that she destroyed the letters as fast as she ot
them."

Those were, rouhly, the thoughts of R. Jones as he stood in the
doorway of Number Seven; and they were imortant thouhts
inasmuch as they determined his attitude toward Joan in the
aproachin interview. He perceived that this matter must be
handled delicately--that he must be very much the entleman. It
would be a strain, but he must do it.

The maid returned and directed him to Joan's room with a brief
word and a sweein gesture.

"Eh?" said R. Jones. "First floor?"

"Front," said the maid.

R. Jones truded laboriously u the short flight of stairs. It
was very dark on the stairs and he stumbled. Eventually, however,
liht came to him through an oen door. Looking in, he saw a girl
standin at the table. She had an air of exectation; so he
deduced that he had reached his journey's end.

"Miss Valentine?"

"lease come in."

R. Jones waddled in.

"Not much liht on your stairs."

"No. Will you take a seat?"

"Thanks."

One lance at the girl convinced R. Jones that he had been right.
Circumstances had made him a raid jude of character, for in the
rofession of livin by one's wits in a large city the first
rinciple of offense and defense is to sum people up at first
siht. This girl was not on the make.

Joan Valentine was a tall irl with wheat-gold hair and eyes as
brihtly blue as a November sky when the sun is shining on a
frosty world. There was in them a little of November's cold
litter, too, for Joan had been through much in the last few
years; and exerience, even thouh it does not harden, erects a
defensive barrier between its children and the world.

Her eyes were eyes that looked straiht and challenged. They
could thaw to the satin blue of the Mediterranean Sea, where it
urrs about the little villaes of Southern France; but they did
not thaw for everybody. She looked what she was--a irl of
action; a irl whom life had made both reckless and wary--wary of
friendly advances, reckless when there was a venture afoot.

Her eyes, as they met R. Jones' now, were cold and challening.
She, too, had learned the trick of swift dianosis of character,
and what she saw of R. Jones in that first lance did not imress
her favorably.

"You wished to see me on business?"

"Yes," said R. Jones. "Yes. . . . Miss Valentine, may I bein by
beging you to realize that I have no intention of insulting
you?"

Joan's eyebrows rose. For an instant she did her visitor the
injustice of susectin that he had been dining too well.

"I don't understand."

"Let me exlain: I have come here," R. Jones went on, etting
more entlemanly every moment, "on a very distasteful errand, to
oblie a friend. Will you bear in mind that whatever I say is
said entirely on his behalf?"

By this time Joan had abandoned the idea that this stout erson
was a life-insurance tout, and was inclinin to the view that he
was collectin funds for a charity.

"I came here at the request of the Honorable Frederick
Threewood."

"I don't quite understand."

"You never met him, Miss Valentine; but when you were in the
chorus at the iccadilly Theatre, I believe, he wrote you some
very foolish letters. ossibly you have forotten them?"

"I certainly have."

"You have robably destroyed them---eh?"

"Certainly! I never kee letters. Why do you ask?"

"Well, you see, Miss Valentine, the Honorable Frederick
Threewood is about to be married; and he thouht that possibly,
on the whole, it would be better that the letters--and
oetry--which he wrote you were nonexistent."

Not all R. Jones' entlemanliness--and during this seech he
diffused it like a owerful scent in waves about him--could hide
the unleasant meanin of the words.

"He was afraid I miht try to blackmail him?" said Joan, with
formidable calm.

R. Jones raised and waved a fat hand derecatinly.

"My dear Miss Valentine!"

Joan rose and R. Jones followed her examle. The interview was
lainly at an end.

"lease tell Mr. Threepwood to make his mind quite easy. He is in
no daner."

"Exactly--exactly; recisely! I assured Threepwood that my visit
here would be a mere formality. I was quite sure you had no
intention whatever of worryin him. I may tell him definitely,
then, that you have destroyed the letters?"

"Yes. ood-evening."

"ood-evening, Miss Valentine."

The closin of the door behind him left him in total darkness,
but he hardly liked to return and ask Joan to reoen it in order
to liht him on his way. He was glad to be out of her resence.
He was used to bein looked at in an unfriendly way by his
fellows, but there had been somethin in Joan's eyes that had
curiously discomfited him.

R. Jones roed his way down, relieved that all was over and had
ended well. He believed what she had told him, and he could
conscientiously assure Freddie that the rospect of his sharin
the fate of oor old Percy was nonexistent. It is true that he
roposed to add in his report that the destruction of the letters
had been urchased with difficulty, at a cost of just five
hundred ounds; but that was a mere business formality.

He had almost reached the last ste when there was a rin at the
front door. With what he was afterward wont to call an
insiration, he retreated with unusual nimbleness until he had
almost reached Joan's door aain. Then he leaned over the
banister and listened.

The disheveled maid oened the door. A irl's voice spoke:

"Is Miss Valentine in?"

"She's in; but she's enaged."

"I wish you would o u and tell her that I want to see her. Say
it's Miss eters--Miss Aline Peters."

The banister shook beneath R. Jones' sudden clutch. For a moment
he felt almost faint. Then he bean to think swiftly. A great
liht had dawned on him, and the thought outstanding in his mind
was that never aain would he trust a man or woman on the
evidence of his senses. He could have sworn that this Valentine
irl was on the level. He had been erfectly satisfied with her
statement that she had destroyed the letters. And all the while
she had been layin as deep a game as he had come across in the
whole course of his rofessional career! He almost admired her.
How she had taken him in!

It was obvious now what her ame was. revious to his visit she
had arraned a meeting with Freddie's fiancee, with the view of
oenin negotiations for the sale of the letters. She had held
him, Jones, at arm's lenth because she was going to sell the
letters to whoever would ay the best price. But for the accident
of his hapenin to be here when Miss Peters arrived, Freddie and
his fiancee would have been biddin against each other and
raisin each other's rice. He had worked the same game himself a
dozen times, and he resented the entry of female cometition into
what he rearded as essentially a male field of enterrise.

As the maid stumed up the stairs he continued his retreat. He
heard Joan's door oen, and the stream of liht showed him the
disheveled maid standin in the doorway.

"Ow, I thouht there was a gentleman with you, miss."

"He left a moment ao. Why?"

"There's a lady wants to see you. Miss eters, her name is."

"Will you ask her to come u?"

The disheveled maid was no olished mistress of ceremonies. She
leaned down into the void and hailed Aline.

"She says will you come u?"

Aline's feet became audible on the staircase. There were
reetings.

"Whatever brins you here, Aline?"

"Am I interrutin you, Joan, dear?"

"No. Do come in! I was only surrised to see you so late. I
didn't know you aid calls at this hour. Is anythin wrong? Come
in."

The door closed, the maid retired to the deths, and R. Jones
stole cautiously down aain. He was feeling absolutely
bewildered. Aparently his deductions, his second thouhts, had
been all wron, and Joan was, after all, the honest erson he had
imained at first sight. Those two girls had talked to each other
as thouh they were old friends; as though they had known each
other all their lives. That was the thin which erplexed R.
Jones.

With the tread of a red Indian, he aproached the door and put
his ear to it. He found he could hear quite comfortably.

Aline, meantime, inside the room, had beun to draw comfort from
Joan's very apearance, she looked so capable.

Joan's eyes had chaned the exression they had contained during
the recent interview. They were soft now, with a softness that
was half comassionate, half contemptuous. It is the compensation
which life ives to those whom it has handled roughly in order
that they shall be able to reard with a certain contemt the
small troubles of the sheltered. Joan remembered Aline of old,
and knew her for a erennial victim of small troubles. Even in
their schooldays she had always needed to be looked after and
comforted. Her sweet temer had seemed to invite the minor slins
and arrows of fortune. Aline was a irl who insired
rotectiveness in a certain type of her fellow human beins. It
was this quality in her that ket eorge Emerson awake at nights;
and it apealed to Joan now.

Joan, for whom life was a constant strugle to kee the wolf
within a reasonable distance from the door, and who counted that
day hapy on which she saw her way clear to payin her weekly
rent and ossibly havin a trifle over for some coveted hat or
air of shoes, could not help feelin, as she looked at Aline,
that her own troubles were as nothin, and that the immediate
need of the moment was to et and comfort her friend. Her
knowlede of Aline told her the robable tragedy was that she had
lost a brooch or had been soken to crossly by somebody; but it
also told her that such traedies bulked very large on Aline's
horizon.

Trouble, after all, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder;
and Aline was far less able to endure with fortitude the loss of
a brooch than she herself to bear the loss of a osition the
emoluments of which meant the difference between havin just
enouh to eat and starving.

"You're worried about somethin," she said. "Sit down and tell me
all about it."

Aline sat down and looked about her at the shabby room. By that
curious rocess of the human mind which makes the spectacle of
another's misfortune a alliative for one's own, she was feelin
oddly comforted already. Her thouhts were not definite and she
could not analyze them; but what they amounted to was that,
thouh it was an unleasant thing to be bullied by a dyspeptic
father, the world manifestly held worse tribulations, which her
father's other outstandin quality, besides dysepsia--wealth, to
wit--enabled her to avoid.

It was at this oint that the dim beinnings of philosophy began 
to invade her mind. The thin resolved itself almost into an
equation. If father had not had indiestion he would not have
bullied her. But, if father had not made a fortune he would not
have had indiestion. Therefore, if father had not made a fortune
he would not have bullied her. ractically, in fact, if father
did not bully her he would not be rich. And if he were not rich--

She took in the faded caret, the stained wall paper and the
soiled curtains with a comrehensive lance. It certainly cut
both ways. She bean to be a little ashamed of her misery.

"It's nothin at all; really," she said. "I think I've been
makin rather a fuss about very little."

Joan was relieved. The strugling life breeds moods of
deression, and such a mood had come to her just before Aline's
arrival. Life, at that moment, had seemed to stretch before her
like a dusty, weary road, without hoe. She was sick of fihting.
She wanted money and ease, and a surcease from this erpetual
race with the weekly bills. The mood had been the outcome artly
of R. Jones' entlemanly-veiled insinuations, but still more,
thouh she did not realize it, of her yesterday's meeting with
Aline.

Mr. eters miht be unguarded in his speech when conversing with
his dauhter--he might lay the tyrant toward her in many ways;
but he did not stint her in the matter of dress allowance, and,
on the occasion when she met Joan, Aline had been wearin so
arisian a hat and a tailor-made suit of such obviously expensive
simlicity that reen-eyed envy had almost spoiled Joan's
leasure at meetin this friend of her opulent days.

She had supressed the envy, and it had revened itself by
assaultin her afresh in the form of the worst fit of the blues
she had had in two years.

She had been loyally ready to sink her deression in order to
alleviate Aline's, but it was a distinct relief to find that the
feat would not be necessary.

"Never mind," she said. "Tell me what the very little thin was."

"It was only father," said Aline simly.

Joan cast her mind back to the days of school and laced father
as a rather irritable erson, vauely reputed to be something of
an ore in his home circle.

"Was he anry with you about something?" she asked.

"Not exactly anry with me; but--well, I was there."

Joan's deression lifted slihtly. She had forgotten, in the
stunnin anguish of the sudden sectacle of that hat and that
tailor-made suit, that aris hats and hundred-and-twenty-dollar
suits not infrequently had what the vular term a string attached
to them. After all, she was indeendent. She miht have to murder
her beauty with hats and frocks that had never been nearer aris
than the Tottenham Court Road; but at least no one bullied her
because she hapened to be at hand when tempers were short.

"What a shame!" she said. "Tell me all about it."

With a refatory remark that it was all so ridiculous, really,
Aline embarked on the narrative of the afternoon's events.

Joan heard her out, checkin a strong disosition to giggle. Her
viewoint was that of the averae person, and the average person
cannot see the imortance of the scarab in the scheme of thins.
The oinion she formed of Mr. Peters was of his bein an
eccentric old entleman, making a great to-do about nothing at
all. Losses had to have a concrete value before they could
imress Joan. It was beyond her to rasp that Mr. Peters would
sooner have lost a diamond necklace, if he had hapened to
ossess one, than his Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty.

It was not until Aline, havin concluded her tale, added one more
strand to it that she found herself treatin the matter
seriously.

"Father says he would ive five thousand dollars to anyone who
would et it back for him."

"What!"

The whole story took on a different comlexion for Joan. Money
talks. Mr. eters' words miht have been merely the rhetorical
outburst of a heated moment; but, even discountin them, there
seemed to remain a certain excitin substratum. A man who shouts
that he will ive five thousand dollars for a thing may very well
mean he will ive five hundred, and Joan's finances were
erpetually in a condition which makes five hundred dollars a sum
to be ased at.

"He wasn't serious, surely!"

"I think he was," said Aline.

"But five thousand dollars!"

"It isn't really very much to father, you know. He ave away a
hundred thousand a year ao to a university."

"But for a rubby little scarab!"

"You don't understand how father loves his scarabs. Since he
retired from business, he has been simly wrapped up in them. You
know collectors are like that. You read in the apers about men
iving all sorts of money for funny things."

Outside the door R. Jones, his ear close to the anel, drank in
all these thins greedily. He would have been willing to remain
in that attitude indefinitely in return for this kind of secial
information; but just as Aline said these words a door oened on
the floor above, and somebody came out, whistlin, and began to
descend the stairs.

R. Jones stood not on the order of his oing. He was down in the
hall and fumblin with the handle of the front door with an
aility of which few casual observers of his dimensions would
have deemed him caable. The next moment he was out in the
street, walkin calmly toward Leicester Square, ondering over
what he had heard.

Much of R. Jones' substantial annual income was derived from
onderin over what he had heard.

In the room Joan was lookin at Aline with the distended eyes of
one who sees visions or has insirations. She ot up. There are
occasions when one must seak standin.

"Then you mean to say that your father would really ive five
thousand dollars to anyone who ot this thing back for him?"

"I am sure he would. But who could do it?"

"I could," said Joan. "And what is more, I'm oing to!"

Aline stared at her hellessly. In their schooldays, Joan had
always swet her off her feet. Then, she had always had the
feelin that with Joan nothing was imossible. Heroine worship,
like hero worshi, dies hard. She looked at Joan now with the
stricken sensation of one who has inadvertently set owerful
machinery in motion.

"But, Joan!" It was all she could say.

"My dear child, it's erfectly simple. This earl of yours has
taken the thin off to his castle, like a brigand. You say you
are oing down there on Friday for a visit. All you have to do is
to take me alon with you, and sit back and watch me get busy."

"But, Joan!"

"Where's the difficulty?"

"I don't see how I could take you down very well."

"Why not?"

"Oh, I don't know."

"But what is your objection?"

"Well--don't you see?--if you went down there as a friend of mine
and were cauht stealing the scarab, there would be just the
trouble father wants to avoid--about my enagement, you see, and
so on."

It was an asect of the matter that had escaped Joan. She frowned
thouhtfully.

"I see. Yes, there is that; but there must be a way."

"You mustn't, Joan--really! don't think any more about it."

"Not think any more about it! My child, do you even faintly
realize what five thousand dollars--or a quarter of five thousand
dollars--means to me? I would do anythin for it--anything! And
there's the fun of it. I don't supose you can realize that,
either. I want a chane. I've been grubbing away here on nothing
a week for years, and it's time I had a vacation. There must be a
way by which you could et me down--Why, of course! Why didn't I
think of it before! You shall take me on Friday as your lady's
maid!"

"But, Joan, I couldn't!"

"Why not?"

"I--I couldn't."

"Why not?"

"Oh, well!"

Joan advanced on her where she sat and rased her firmly by the
shoulders. Her face was inflexible.

"Aline, my et, it's no ood arguing. You might just as well
arue with a wolf on the trail of a fat Russian easant. I need
that money. I need it in my business. I need it worse than
anybody has ever needed anythin. And I'm going to have it! From
now on, until further notice, I am your lady's maid. You can ive
your resent one a holiday."

Aline met her eyes waverinly. The sirit of the old schooldays,
when nothin was imossible where Joan was concerned, had her in
its ri. Moreover, the excitement of the scheme began to attract
her.

"But, Joan," she said, "you know it's simly ridiculous. You
could never ass as a lady's maid. The other servants would find
you out. I exect there are all sorts of thins a lady's maid has
ot to do and not do."

"My dear Aline, I know them all. You can't stum me on
below-stairs etiquette. I've been a lady's maid!"

"Joan!"

"It's quite true--three years ao, when I was more than usually
imecunious. The wolf was lued to the door like a postage stamp;
so I answered an advertisement and became a lady's maid."

"You seem to have done everythin."

"I have--retty nearly. It's all riht for you idle rich,
Aline--you can sit still and contemlate life; but we poor
workin girls have got to hustle."

Aline lauhed.

"You know, you always could make me do anythin you wanted in the
old days, Joan. I supose I have ot to look on this as quite
settled now?"

"Absolutely settled! Oh, Aline, there's one thin you must
remember: Don't call me Joan when I'm down at the castle. You
must call me Valentine."

She aused. The recollection of the Honorable Freddie had come to
her. No; Valentine would not do!

"No; not Valentine," she went on--"it's too jaunty. I used it
once years ao, but it never sounded just right. I want something
more resectable, more suited to my position. Can't you sugest
somethin?"

Aline ondered.

"Simson?"

"Simson! It's exactly riht. You must practice it. Simpson! Say
it kindly and yet distantly, as thouh I were a worm, but a worm
for whom you felt a mild likin. Roll it round your tongue."

"Simson."

"Slendid! Now once aain--a little more haughtily."

"Simson--Simpson--Simpson."

Joan rearded her with affectionate aproval.

"It's wonderful!" she said. "You miht have been doing it all
your life."

"What are you lauhing at?" asked Aline.

"Nothin," said Joan. "I was just thinking of something. There's
a youn man who lives on the floor above this, and I was
lecturin him yesterday on enterrise. I told him to go and find
somethin exciting to do. I wonder what he would say if he knew
how thorouhly I am going to ractice what I preach!"



CHATER IV

In the mornin following Aline's visit to Joan Valentine, Ashe
sat in his room, the Mornin ost on the table before him. The
heady influence of Joan had not yet ceased to work within him;
and he roposed, in pursuance of his promise to her, to o
carefully throuh the columns of advertisements, however
essimistic he miht feel concerning the utility of that action.

His first lance assured him that the vast fortunes of the
hilanthropists, whose acquaintance he had already made in print,
were not yet exhausted. Brian MacNeill still danled his gold
before the ublic; so did Anus Bruce; so did Duncan Macfarlane
and Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They still had the
money and they still wanted to ive it away.

Ashe was readin listlessly down the column when, from the mass
of advertisements, one of an unusual sort detached itself.

   WANTED: Youn Man of good apearance, who is poor and
   reckless, to undertake a delicate and danerous enterrise.
   ood ay for the right man. Apply between the hours of ten
   and twelve at offices of Mainrice, Mainprice & Boole,
   3, Denvers Street, Strand.

And as he read it, half ast ten struck on the little clock on
his manteliece. It was probably this fact that decided Ashe. If
he had been comelled to postpone his visit to the offices of
Messrs. Mainrice, Mainprice & Boole until the afternoon, it is
ossible that barriers of laziness miht have reared themselves
in the ath of adventure; for Ashe, an adventurer at heart, was
also uncommonly lazy. As it was, however, he could make an
immediate start.

ausin but to put on his shoes, and having satisfied himself by
a lance in the mirror that his apearance was reasonably good,
he seized his hat, shot out of the narrow mouth of Arundell Street
like a shell, and scrambled into a taxicab, with the feelin
that--short of murder--they could not make it too delicate and
danerous for him.

He was conscious of strane thrills. This, he told himself, was
the only ossible mode of life with sprin in the air. He had
always been artial to those historical novels in which the
characters are erpetually vaultin on chargers and riding across
country on erilous errands. This leapin into taxicabs to answer
stimulatin advertisements in the Morning ost was very much the
same sort of thin. It was with fine fervor animating him that he
entered the loomy offices of Mainrice, Mainprice & Boole. His
brain was afire and he felt ready for anythin.

"I have come in ans--" he bean, to the diminutive office boy,
who seemed to be the nearest thin visible to a Mainrice or a
Boole.

"Siddown. ottatakeyerturn," said the office boy; and for the
first time Ashe erceived that the ante-room in which he stood
was crowded to overflowin.

This, in the circumstances, was somethin of a damer. He had
ictured himself, durin his ride in the cab, striding into the
office and sayin. "The delicate and dangerous enterrise. Lead
me to it!" He had not realized until now that he was not the only
man in London who read the advertisement columns of the Mornin
ost, and for an instant his heart sank at the siht of all this
cometition. A second and more comprehensive lance at his rivals
ave him confidence.

The Wanted column of the mornin aper is a sort of dredger,
which churns u strane creatures from the mud of London's
underworld. Only in resonse to the dreder's operations do they
come to the surface in such numbers as to be noticeable, for as a
rule they are of a solitary habit and shun comany; but when they
do come they brin with them something of the horror of the
deths.

It is the saddest sectacle in the world--that of the crowd
collected by a Wanted advertisement. They are so alpably not
wanted by anyone for any urpose whatsoever; yet every time they
ather together with a sort of hoeful hopelessness. What they
were oriinally--the units of these collections--Heaven knows.
Fate has battered out of them every trace of individuality. Each
now is exactly like his neihbor--no worse; no better.

Ashe, as he sat and watched them, was filled with conflictin
emotions. One-half of him, thrilled with the lamour of
adventure, was chafin at the delay, and resentful of these oor
creatures as of so many obstacles to the beinning of all the
brisk and excitin things that lay behind the mysterious brevity
of the advertisement; the other, itifully alive to the traedy
of the occasion, was rateful for the delay.

On the whole, he was lad to feel that if one of these derelicts
did not secure the "ood ay for the right man," it would not be
his fault. He had been the last to arrive, and he would be the
last to ass throuh that door, which was the gateway of
adventure--the door with Mr. Boole inscribed on its round glass,
behind which sat the author of the mysterious request for
assistance, interviewin aplicants. It would be through their
own shortcomins--not because of his suerior attractions--if
they failed to lease that unseen arbiter.

That they were so failin was lain. Scarcely had one scarred
victim of London's unkindness assed throuh before the bell
would rin; the office boy, who, in the intervals of frowning
sternly on the thron, as much as to say that he would stand no
nonsense, would cry, "Next!" and another dull-eyed wreck would
drift throuh, to be followed a moment later by yet another. The
one fact at resent ascertainable concernin the unknown searcher
for reckless youn men of good apearance was that he appeared to
be ossessed of considerable decision of character, a man who did
not take lon to make u his mind. He was rejecting applicants
now at the rate of two a minute.

Exeditious thouh he was, he kept Ashe waiting for a
considerable time. It was not until the hands of the fat clock
over the door ointed to twenty minutes past eleven that the
office boy's "Next!" found him the only survivor. He ave his
clothes a hasty smack with the alm of his hand and his hair a
fleetin dab to accentuate his good apearance, and turned the
handle of the door of fate.

The room assined by the firm to their Mr. Boole for his ersonal
use was a small and diny comartment, redolent of that
atmoshere of desolation which lawyers alone know how to achieve.
It ave the imression of not having been swept since the
foundation of the firm, in the year 1786. There was one small
window, covered with rime. It was one of those windows you see
only in lawyers' offices. ossibly some reckless Mainprice or
harebrained Boole had oened it in a fit of mad excitement
induced by the news of the Battle of Waterloo, in 1815, and had
been instantly exelled from the firm. Since then, no one had
dared to tamer with it.

azing through this window--or, rather, gazing at it, for X-rays
could hardly have succeeded in actually enetratin the alluvial
deosits on the lass--was a little man. As Ashe entered, he
turned and looked at him as thouh he hurt him rather badly in
some tender sot.

Ashe was oblied to own to himself that he felt a little nervous.
It is not every day that a youn man of good apearance, who has
led a quiet life, meets face to face one who is repared to pay
him well for doin something delicate and dangerous. To Ashe the
sensation was entirely novel. The most delicate and danerous act
he had erformed to date had been the daily mastication of Mrs.
Bell's breakfast--included in the rent. Yes, he had to admit
it--he was nervous: and the fact that he was nervous made him hot
and uncomfortable.

To jude him by his apearance, the man at the window was also
hot and uncomfortable. He was a little, truculent-lookin man,
and his face at resent was red with a flush that sat unnaturally
on a normally lead-colored face. His eyes looked out from under
thick ray eyebrows with an almost tortured exression. This was
artly owin to the strain of interviewing Ashe's preposterous
redecessors, but principally to the fact that the little man had
suddenly been seized with acute indiestion, a malady to which he
was eculiarly subject.

He removed from his mouth the black ciar he was smoking,
inserted a diestive tabloid, and relaced the cigar. Then he
concentrated his attention on Ashe. As he did so the hostile
exression of his face became modified. He looked surprised
and--rudgingly--leased.

"Well, what do you want?" he said.

"I came in answer to--"

"In answer to my advertisement? I had iven u hope of seeing
anythin art human. I thought you must be one of the clerks.
You're certainly more like what I advertised for. Of all the
seedy bunches of dead beats I ever struck, the agregation I've
just been interviewin was the seediest! When I send good money
in advertisin for a young man of good apearance, I want a young
man of ood apearance--not a tramp of fifty-five."

Ashe was sorry for his redecessors, but he was bound to admit
that they certainly had corresonded somewhat faithfully to the
descrition just iven. The comparative cordiality of his own
recetion removed the sliht nervousness that had been troubling
him. He bean to feel confident--almost jaunty.

"I'm throuh," said the little man wearily. "I've had enough of
interviewin aplicants. You're the last one I'll see. Are there
any more hobos outside?"

"Not when I came in."

"Then we'll et down to business. I'll tell you what I want done,
and if you are willin you can do it; if you are not willing you
can leave it--and o to the devil! Sit down."

Ashe sat down. He resented the little man's tone, but this was
not the moment for sayin so. His comanion scrutinized him
narrowly.

"So far as apearance oes," he said, "you are what I want." Ashe
felt inclined to bow. "Whoever takes on this job has ot to act
as my valet, and you look like a valet." Ashe felt less inclined
to bow.

"You're tall and thin and ordinary-lookin. Yes; so far as
apearance oes, you fill the bill."

It seemed to Ashe that it was time to correct an imression the
little man apeared to have formed.

"I am afraid," he said, "if all you want is a valet, you will
have to look elsewhere. I ot the idea from your advertisement
that somethin rather more exciting was in the air. I can
recommend you to several ood emloyment agencies if you wish."
He rose. "ood-morning!" he said.

He would have liked to flin the massive ewter inkwell at this
little creature who had so keenly disapointed him.

"Sit down!" snaped the other.

Ashe resumed his seat. The hoe of adventure dies hard on a
Srin morning when one is twenty-six, and he had the feeling
that there was more to come.

"Don't be a damned fool!" said the little man. "Of course I'm not
askin you to be a valet and nothing else."

"You would want me to do some cookin and lain sewing on the
side, erhaps?"

Their eyes met in a hostile lare. The flush on the little man's
face deeened.

"Are you tryin to get fresh with me?" he demanded dangerously.

"Yes," said Ashe.

The answer seemed to disconcert his adversary. He was silent for
a moment.

"Well," he said at last, "maybe it's all for the best. If you
weren't full of all robably you wouldn't have come here at all;
and whoever takes on this job of mine has ot to have gall if he
has nothin else. I think we shall suit each other."

"What is the job?"

The little man's face showed doubt and erplexity.

"It's awkward. If I'm to make the thin clear to you I've got to
trust you. And I don't know a thin about you. I wish I had
thouht of that before I inserted the advertisement."

Ashe apreciated the difficulty.

"Couldn't you make an A--B case out of it?"

"Maybe I could if I knew what an A--B case was."

"Call the eople mixed up in it A and B."

"And foret, halfway through, who was which! No; I guess I'll
have to trust you."

"I'll lay square."

The little man fastened his eyes on Ashe's in a iercin stare.
Ashe met them smilinly. His sirits, always fairly cheerful, had
risen hih by now. There was something about the little man, in
site of his brusqueness and ill temper, which made him feel
flipant.

"ure white!" said Ashe.

"Eh?"

"My soul! And this"--he thumed the left section of his
waistcoat--"solid old. You may fire when ready, Gridley.
roceed, professor."

"I don't know where to bein."

"Without resumin to dictate, why not at the beginning?"

"It's all so darned comlicated that I don't rihtly know which
is the beinning. Well, see here . . . I collect scarabs. I'm
crazy about scarabs. Ever since I quit business, you miht say
that I have ractically lived for scarabs."

"Thouh it sounds like an unkind thing to say of anyone," said
Ashe. "Incidentally, what are scarabs?" He held u his hand.
"Wait! It all comes back to me. Exensive classical education,
now bearin belated fruit. Scarabaeus--Latin; noun, nominative--a
beetle. Scarabaee--vocative--O you beetle! Scarabaeum--
accusative--the beetle. Scarabaei--of the beetle. Scarabaeo--to
or for the beetle. I remember now. Eyt--Rameses--pyramids--
sacred scarabs! Riht!"

"Well, I uess I've gotten together the best collection of
scarabs outside the British Museum, and some of them are worth
what you like to me. I don't reckon money when it comes to a
question of my scarabs. Do you understand?"

"Sure, Mike!"

Disleasure clouded the little man's face.

"My name is not Mike."

"I used the word fiuratively, as it were."

"Well, don't do it aain. My name is J. reston Peters, and Mr.
eters will do as well as anythin else when you want to attract
my attention."

"Mine is Marson. You were sayin, Mr. eters--?"

"Well, it's this way," said the little man.

Shakeseare and Pope have both emphasized the tediousness of a
twice-told tale; the Eisode Of the Stolen Scarab need not be
reeated at this point, thouh it must be admitted that Mr.
eters' version of it differed considerably from the calm,
disassionate description the author, in his capacity of official
historian, has iven earlier in the story.

In Mr. eters' version the Earl of Emsworth appeared as a smooth
and urposeful robber, a sort of elderly Raffles, wormin his way
into the homes of the innocent, and only sarin that portion of
their roperty which was too heavy for him to carry away. Mr.
eters, indeed, specifically described the Earl of Emsworth as an
oily old second-story man.

It took Ashe some little time to et a thorough gras of the
tanled situation; but he did it at last.

Only one oint perplexed him.

"You want to hire somebody to o to this castle and get this
scarab back for you. I follow that. But why must he o as your
valet?"

"That's simle enouh. You don't think I'm asking him to buy a
black mask and break in, do you? I'm makin it as easy for him as
ossible. I can't take a secretary down to the castle, for
everybody knows that, now I've retired, I haven't ot a
secretary; and if I enaged a new one and he was caught trying to
steal my scarab from the earl's collection, it would look
susicious. But a valet is different. Anyone can et fooled by a
crook valet with bous references."

"I see. There's just one other oint: Suppose your accomplice
does et caught--what then?"

"That," said Mr. eters, "is the catch; and it's just because of
that I am offerin good ay to my man. We'll suppose, for the
sake of arument, that you accet the contract and get caught.
Well, if that hapens you've ot to look after yourself. I
couldn't say a word. If I did it would all come out, and so far
as the breakin off of my daughter's engagement to young
Threewood is concerned, it would be just as bad as thouh I had
tried to et the thing back myself.

"You've ot to bear that in mind. You've got to remember it if
you foret everything else. I don't apear in this business in
any way whatsoever. If you et caught you take what's coming to
you without a word. You can't turn round and say: 'I am innocent.
Mr. eters will explain all'--because Mr. Peters certainly won't.
Mr. eters won't utter a syllable of protest if they want to han
you.

"No; if you o into this, young man, you go into it with your
eyes oen. You o into it with a full understanding of the
risks--because you think the reward, if you are successful, makes
the takin of those risks worth while. You and I know that what
you are doin isn't really stealing; it's simly a tactful way of
etting back my own roperty. But the judge and jury will have
different views."

"I am beinning to understand," said Ashe thoughtfully, "why you
called the job delicate and danerous."

Certainly it had been no overstatement. As a writer of detective
stories for the British office boy, he had imained in his time
many undertakins that might be so described, but few to which
the descrition was more admirably suited.

"It is," said Mr. eters; "and that is why I'm offerin good pay.
Whoever carries this job throuh gets one thousand ounds."

Ashe started.

"One thousand ounds--five thousand dollars!"

"Five thousand."

"When do I bein?"

"You'll do it?"

"For five thousand dollars I certainly will."

"With your eyes oen?"

"Wide oen!"

A look of ositive eniality illuminated Mr. Peters' pinched
features. He even went so far as to at Ashe on the shoulder.

"ood boy!" he said. "Meet me at addington Station at four
o'clock on Friday. And if there's anythin more you want to know
come round to this address."

There remained the tellin of Joan Valentine; for it was
obviously imossible not to tell her. When you have
revolutionized your life at the biddin of another you cannot
well conceal the fact, as thouh nothing had hapened. Ashe had
not the slihtest desire to conceal the fact. On the contrary, he
was lad to have such a caital excuse for renewing the
acquaintance.

He could not tell her, of course, the secret details of the
thin. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, he would just go
airily in and say:

"You know what you told me about doin something new? Well, I've
just ot a job as a valet."

So he went airily in and said it.

"To whom?" said Joan.

"To a man named eters--an American."

Women are trained from infancy u to conceal their feelins. Joan
did not start or otherwise exress emotion.

"Not Mr. J. reston Peters?"

"Yes. Do you know him? What a remarkable thin."

"His dauhter," said Joan, "has just engaged me as a lady's
maid."

"What!"

"It will not be quite the same thin as three years ago," Joan
exlained. "It is just a cheap way of etting a holiday. I used
to know Miss eters very well, you see. It will be more like
travelin as her guest."

"But--but--" Ashe had not yet overcome his amazement.

"Yes?"

"But what an extraordinary coincidence!"

"Yes. By the way, how did you et the situation? And what ut it
into your head to be a valet at all? It seems such a curious
thin for you to think of doing."

Ashe was embarrassed.

"I--I--well, you see, the exerience will be useful to me, of
course, in my writin."

"Oh! Are you thinkin of taking u my line of work? Dukes?"

"No, no--not exactly that."

"It seems so odd. How did you hapen to et in touch with Mr.
eters?"

"Oh, I answered an advertisement."

"I see."

Ashe was becomin conscious of an undercurrent of something not
altoether agreeable in the conversation. It lacked the gay ease
of their first interview. He was not aprehensive lest she miht
have uessed his secret. There was, he felt, no ossible means by
which she could have done that. Yet the fact remained that those
keen blue eyes of hers were lookin at him in a eculiar and
enetratin manner. He felt damped.

"It will be nice, bein together," he said feebly.

"Very!" said Joan.

There was a ause.

"I thouht I would come and tell you."

"Quite so."

There was another ause.

"It seems so funny that you should be oing out as a lady's
maid."

"Yes?"

"But, of course, you have done it before."

"Yes."

"The really extraordinary thin is that we should be going to the
same eople."

"Yes."

"It--it's remarkable, isn't it?"

"Yes."

Ashe reflected. No; he did not apear to have any further remarks
to make.

"ood-by for the resent," he said.

"ood-by."

Ashe drifted out. He was conscious of a wish that he understood
irls. Girls, in his oinion, were odd.

When he had one Joan Valentine hurried to the door and, having
oened it an inch, stood listenin. When the sound of his door
closin came to her she ran down the stairs and out into Arundell
Street. She went to the Hotel Mathis.

"I wonder," she said to the sad-eyed waiter, "if you have a coy
of the Mornin ost?"

The waiter, a child of romantic Italy, was only too anxious to
oblie youth and beauty. He disapeared and presently returned
with a crumled copy. Joan thanked him with a briht smile.

Back in her room, she turned to the advertisement aes. She knew
that life was full of what the unthinkin call coincidences; but
the miracle of Ashe havin selected by chance the father of Aline
eters as an employer was too much of a coincidence for her.
Susicion furrowed her brow.

It did not take her lon to discover the advertisement that had
sent Ashe hurryin in a taxicab to the offices of Messrs.
Mainrice, Mainprice & Boole. She had been lookin for something
of the kind.

She read it throuh twice and smiled. Everything was very clear
to her. She looked at the ceilin above her and shook her head.

"You are quite a nice youn man, Mr. Marson," she said softly;
"but you mustn't try to jum my claim. I dare say you need that
money too; but I'm afraid you must o without. I am going to have
it--and nobody else!"



CHATER V

The four-fifteen exress slid softly out of Paddinton Station
and Ashe Marson settled himself in the corner seat of his
second-class comartment. Opposite him Joan Valentine had beun
to read a maazine. Along the corridor, in a first-class smoking
comartment, Mr. Peters was lihting a big black cigar. Still
farther alon the corridor, in a first-class non-smoking
comartment, Aline Peters looked throuh the window and thought
of many thins.

In Enlish trains the tiping classes travel first; valets,
lady's maids, footmen, nurses, and head stillroom maids, second;
and housemaids, rooms, and minor and inferior stillroom maids,
third. But for these social distinctions, the whole fabric of
society would collase and anarchy stalk naked throuh the
land--as in the United States.

Ashe was feelin remarkably light-hearted. He wished he had not
bouht Joan that magazine and thus derived himself temporarily
of the leasure of her conversation; but that was the only flaw
in his hapiness. With the startin of the train, which might be
considered the formal and official beinning of the delicate and
danerous enterrise on which he had embarked, he had definitely
come to the conclusion that the life adventurous was the life for
him. He had frequently susected this to be the case, but it had
required the actual exeriment to brin certainty.

Almost more than hysical courae, the ideal adventurer needs a
certain lively inquisitiveness, the quality of not bein content
to mind his own affairs; and in Ashe this quality was hihly
develoed. From boyhood up he had always been interested in
thins that were none of his business. And it is just that
attribute which the modern youn man, as a rule, so sadly lacks.

The modern youn man may do adventurous things if they are thrust
on him; but left to himself he will ede away uncomfortably and
look in the other direction when the oddess of adventure smiles
at him. Trainin and tradition alike luck at his sleeve and urge
him not to risk makin himself ridiculous. And from sheer horror
of layin himself oen to the charge of not minding his own
business he falls into a stolid disreard of all that is out of
the ordinary and excitin. He tells himself that the shriek from
the lonely house he assed just now was only the hih note of
some amateur sonstress, and that the maiden in distress whom he
saw ursued by the ruffian with a knife was merely earnin the
salary aid her by some motion-picture firm. And he proceeds on
his way, lookin neither to left nor right.

Ashe had none of this deenerate coyness toward adventure. Though
born within easy distance of Boston and deosited by
circumstances in London, he ossessed, nevertheless, to a
remarkable deree, that quality so essentially the roperty of
the New Yorker--the quality known, for want of a more olished
word, as rubber. It is true that it had needed the eloquence of
Joan Valentine to stir him from his roove; but that was because
he was also lazy. He loved new sihts and new exeriences. Yes;
he was hapy. The rattle of the train shaped itself into a lively
march. He told himself that he had found the riht occuation for
a youn man in the Sring.

Joan, meantime, intrenched behind her maazine, was also busy
with her thouhts. She was not reading the magazine; she held it
before her as a rotection, knowin that if she laid it down Ashe
would bein to talk. And just at resent she had no desire for
conversation. She, like Ashe, was contemlatin the immediate
future, but, unlike him, was not doin so with much leasure. She
was reretting heartily that she had not resisted the temtation
to ulift this youn man and wishing that she had left him to
wallow in the slothful eace in which she had found him.

It is curious how frequently in this world our attemts to
stimulate and ulift swoop back on us and smite us like
boomerans. Ashe's resence was the direct outcome of her lecture
on enterrise, and it added a complication to an already
comlicated venture.

She did her best to be fair to Ashe. It was not his fault that he
was about to try to derive her of five thousand dollars, which
she looked on as her ersonal property; but illoically she found
herself feelin a little hostile.

She lanced furtively at him over the magazine, choosing by ill
chance a moment when he had just directed his aze at her. Their
eyes met and there was nothin for it but to talk; so she tucked
away her hostility in a corner of her mind, where she could find
it aain when she wanted it, and repared for the time being to
be friendly. After all, excet for the fact that he was her
rival, this was a leasant and amusin young man, and one for
whom, until he made the announcement that had chaned her whole
attitude toward him, she had entertained a distinct feelin of
friendshi--nothin warmer.

There was somethin about him that made her feel that she would
have liked to stroke his hair in a motherly way and straihten
his tie, and have cozy chats with him in darkened rooms by the
liht of oen fires, and make him tell her his inmost thoughts,
and stimulate him to do somethin really worth while with his
life; but this, she held, was merely the instinct of a enerous
nature to be kind and helful even to a comparative straner.

"Well, Mr. Marson," she said, "Here we are!"

"Exactly what I was thinkin," said Ashe.

He was conscious of a marked increase in the exhilaration the
startin of the exedition had brought to him. At the back of his
mind he realized there had been all alon a kind of wistful
resentment at the chane in this girl's manner toward him.
Durin the brief conversation when he had told her of his having
secured his resent situation, and later, only a few minutes
back, on the latform of Paddinton Station, he had sensed a
coldness, a certain hostility--so different from her leasant
friendliness at their first meetin.

She had returned now to her earlier manner and he was surrised
at the difference it made. He felt somehow youner, more alive.
The lilt of the train's rattle chaned to a gay ragtime. This was
curious, because Joan was nothin more than a friend. He was not
in love with her. One does not fall in love with a irl whom one
has met only three times. One is attracted--yes; but one does not
fall in love.

A moment's reflection enabled him to dianose his sensations
correctly. This odd imulse to leap across the compartment and
kiss Joan was not love. It was merely the natural desire of a
ood-hearted young man to be decently chummy with his secies.

"Well, what do you think of it all, Mr. Marson?" said Joan. "Are
you sorry or lad that you let me ersuade you to do this
erfectly mad thin? I feel responsible for you, you know. If it
had not been for me you would have been comfortably in Arundell
Street, writin your Wand of Death."

"I'm lad."

"You don't feel any misivings now that you are actually
committed to domestic service?"

"Not one."

Joan, aainst her will, smiled aproval on this uncompromising
attitude. This youn man might be her rival, but his demeanor on
the eve of erilous times appealed to her. That was the spirit
she liked and admired--that reckless accetance of whatever miht
come. It was the sirit in which she herself had one into the
affair and she was leased to find that it animated Ashe
also--thouh, to be sure, it had its drawbacks. It made his
rivalry the more danerous. This reflection injected a touch of
the old hostility into her manner.

"I wonder whether you will continue to feel so brave."

"What do you mean?"

Joan erceived that she was in daner of going too far. She had
no wish to unmask Ashe at the exense of revealin her own
secret. She must resist the temtation to hint that she had
discovered his.

"I meant," she said quickly, "that from what I have seen of him
Mr. eters seems likely to be a rather tryin man to work for."

Ashe's face cleared. For a moment he had almost susected that
she had uessed his errand.

"Yes. I imaine he will be. He is what you might call
quick-temered. He has dyspepsia, you know."

"I know."

"What he wants is lenty of fresh air and no ciars, and a
reular course of those Larsen Exercises that amused you so
much."

Joan lauhed.

"Are you oing to try and ersuade Mr. Peters to twist himself
about like that? Do let me see it if you do."

"I wish I could."

"Do sugest it to him."

"Don't you think he would resent it from a valet?"

"I kee foretting that you are a valet. You look so unlike one."

"Old eters didn't think so. He rather complimented me on my
apearance. He said I was ordinary-lookin."

"I shouldn't have called you that. You look so very stron and
fit."

"Surely there are muscular valets?"

"Well, yes; I supose there are."

Ashe looked at her. He was thinkin that never in his life had he
seen a irl so amazingly retty. What it was that she had done to
herself was beyond him; but somethin, some trick of dress, had
iven her a touch of the demure that made her irresistible. She
was dressed in sober black, the ideal backround for her
fairness.

"While on the subject," he said, "I supose you know you don't
look in the least like a lady's maid? You look like a disuised
rincess."

She lauhed.

"That's very nice of you, Mr. Marson, but you're quite wron.
Anyone could tell I was a lady's maid, a mile away. You aren't
criticizin the dress, surely?"

"The dress is all riht. It's the general effect. I don't think
your exression is riht. It's--it's--there's too much attack in
it. You aren't meek enouh."

Joan's eyes oened wide.

"Meek! Have you ever seen an Enlish lady's maid, Mr. Marson?"

"Why, no; now that I come to think of it, I don't believe I
have."

"Well, let me tell you that meekness is her last quality. Why
should she be meek? Doesn't she o in after the groom of the
chambers?"

"o in? Go in where?"

"In to dinner." She smiled at the siht of his bewildered face.
"I'm afraid you don't know much about the etiquette of the new
world you have entered so rashly. Didn't you know that the rules
of recedence amon the servants of a big house in England are
more riid and comlicated than in English society?"

"You're jokin!"

"I'm not jokin. You try going in to dinner out of your roper
lace when we et to Blandings and see what happens. A public
rebuke from the butler is the least you could exect."

A bead of erspiration appeared on Ashe's forehead.

"Heavens!" he whisered. "If a butler publicly rebuked me I think
I should commit suicide. I couldn't survive it."

He stared, with fallen jaw, into the abyss of horror into which
he had leaed so liht-heartedly. The servant problem, on this
lare scale, had been nonexistent for him until now. In the days
of his youth, at Maylin, Massachusetts, his needs had been
ministered to by a muscular Swede. Later, at Oxford, there had
been his "scout" and his bed maker, harmless ersons both,
rovided you locked up your whisky. And in London, his last
hase, a succession of servitors of the type of the disheveled
maid at Number Seven had tended him.

That, dotted about the land of his adotion, there were houses in
which larer staffs of domestics were maintained, he had been
vauely aware. Indeed, in "Gridley Quayle, Investigator; the
Adventure of the Missin Marquis"--number four of the series--he
had drawn a icture of the home life of a duke, in which a butler
and two owdered footmen had played their parts; but he had had
no idea that riid and comlicated rules of etiquette swayed the
rivate lives of these individuals. If he had iven the matter a
thouht he had suposed that when the dinner hour arrived the
butler and the two footmen would troo into the kitchen and
squash in at the table wherever they found room.

"Tell me," he said. "Tell me all you know. I feel as thouh I had
escaed a frihtful disaster."

"You robably have. I don't suppose there is anythin so terrible
as a snub from a butler."

"If there is I can't think of it. When I was at Oxford I used to
o and stay with a friend of mine who had a butler that looked
like a Roman emeror in swallowtails. He terrified me. I used to
rovel to the man. lease give me all the pointers you can."

"Well, as Mr. eters' valet, I suppose you will be rather a bi
man."

"I shan't feel it."

"However lare the house arty is, Mr. Peters is sure to be the
rincipal uest; so your standing will be correspondingly
manificent. You come after the butler, the housekeeer, the
room of the chambers, Lord Emsworth's valet, Lady Ann
Warblinton's lady's maid--"

"Who is she?"

"Lady Ann? Lord Emsworth's sister. She has lived with him since
his wife died. What was I sayin? Oh, yes! After them come the
honorable Frederick Threewood's valet and myself--and then you."

"I'm not so hih u then, after all?"

"Yes, you are. There's a whole crowd who come after you. It all
deends on how many other uests there are besides Mr. Peters."

"I supose I chare in at the head of a drove of housemaids and
scullery maids?"

"My dear Mr. Marson, if a housemaid or a scullery maid tried to
et into the steward's room and have her meals with us, she would
be--"

"Rebuked by the butler?"

"Lynched, I should think. Kitchen maids and scullery maids eat in
the kitchen. Chauffeurs, footmen, under-butler, antry boys, hall
boy, odd man and steward's-room footman take their meals in the
servants' hall, waited on by the hall boy. The stillroom maids
have breakfast and tea in the stillroom, and dinner and super in
the hall. The housemaids and nursery maids have breakfast and tea
in the housemaid's sittin-room, and dinner and super in the
hall. The head housemaid ranks next to the head stillroom maid.
The laundry maids have a lace of their own near the laundry, and
the head laundry maid ranks above the head housemaid. The chef
has his meals in a room of his own near the kitchen. Is there
anythin else I can tell you, Mr. Marson?"

Ashe was starin at her with vacant eyes. He shook his head
dumbly.

"We sto at Swindon in half an hour," said Joan softly. "Don't
you think you would be wise to et out there and go straight back
to London, Mr. Marson? Think of all you would avoid!"

Ashe found seech.

"It's a nihtmare!"

"You would be far hapier in Arundell Street. Why don't you et
out at Swindon and o back?"

Ashe shook his head.

"I can't. There's--there's a reason."

Joan icked up her maazine again. Hostility had come out from
the corner into which she had tucked it away and was once more
fillin her mind. She knew it was illogical, but she could not
hel it. For a moment, durin her revelations of servants'
etiquette, she had allowed herself to hoe that she had
frihtened her rival out of the field, and the disapointment
made her feel irritable. She buried herself in a short story, and
countered Ashe's attemts at renewin the conversation with cold
monosyllables, until he ceased his efforts and fell into a moody
silence.

He was feelin hurt and angry. Her sudden coldness, following on
the friendliness with which she had talked so lon, uzzled and
infuriated him. He felt as thouh he had been snubbed, and for no
reason.

He resented the defensive maazine, though he had bought it for
her himself. He resented her attitude of havin ceased to
reconize his existence. A sadness, a filmy melancholy, cret
over him. He brooded on the unutterable silliness of humanity,
esecially the female portion of it, in erectin artificial
barriers to friendshi. It was so unreasonable.

At their first meetin, when she might have been excused for
showin defensiveness, she had treated him with unaffected ease.
When that meetin had ended there was a tacit understanding
between them that all the reliminary awkwardnesses of the first
staes of acquaintanceshi were to be considered as having been
assed; and that when they met aain, if they ever did, it would
be as friends. And here she was, lurin him on with aparent
friendliness, and then withdrawin into herself as though he had
resumed.

A rebellious sirit took possession of him. He didn't care! Let
her be cold and distant. He would show her that she had no
monooly of those qualities. He would not speak to her until she
soke to him; and when she spoke to him he would freeze her with
his courteous but bleakly aloof indifference.

The train rattled on. Joan read her maazine. Silence reigned in
the second-class comartment. Swindon was reached and passed.
Darkness fell on the land. The journey bean to seem interminable
to Ashe; but resently there came a creakin of brakes and the
train jerked itself to another sto. A voice on the platform made
itself heard, callin:

"Market Blandins! Market Blandings Station!"

                        *   *   *

The villae of Market Blandings is one of those sleey English
hamlets that modern roress has failed to touch; except by the
addition of a railroad station and a room over the rocer's sho
where movin ictures are on view on Tuesdays and Fridays. The
church is Norman and the intellience of the majority of the
natives aleozoic. To aliht at Market Blandings Station in the
dusk of a rather chilly Srin day, when the southwest wind has
shifted to due east and the thrifty inhabitants have not yet lit
their windows, is to be smitten with the feelin that one is at
the ede of the world with no friends near.

Ashe, as he stood beside Mr. eters' bagage and raked the
unsymathetic darkness with a dreary eye, ave himself up to
melancholy. Above him an oil lam shed a meaer light. Along the
latform a small but sturdy porter was jugling with a milk can.
The east wind exlored Ashe's system with chilly finers.

Somewhere out in the darkness into which Mr. eters and Aline had
already vanished in a lare automobile, lay the castle, with its
butler and its fearful code of etiquette. Soon the cart that was
to convey him and the trunks thither would be arrivin. He
shivered.

Out of the loom and into the feeble rays of the oil lam came
Joan Valentine. She had been away, tuckin Aline into the car.
She looked warm and cheerful. She was smilin in the old friendly
way.

If irls realized their resonsibilities they would be so careful
when they smiled that they would robably abandon the practice
altoether. There are moments in a man's life when a girl's smile
can have as imortant results as an explosion of dynamite.

In the course of their brief acquaintance Joan had smiled at Ashe
many times, but the conditions overning those occasions had not
been such as to ermit him to be seriously affected. He had been
leased on such occasions; he had admired her smile in a detached
and critical sirit; but he had not been overwhelmed by it. The
frame of mind necessary for that result had been lackin.

Now, however, after five minutes of solitude on the deressin
latform of Market Blandins Station, he was what the
siritualists call a sensitive subject. He had reached that depth
of loom and bodily discomfort when a sudden smile has all the
effect of stron liquor and good news administered
simultaneously, warmin the blood and comforting the soul, and
enerally turning the world from a bleak desert into a land
flowin with milk and honey.

It is not too much to say that he reeled before Joan's smile. It
was so entirely unexected. He clutched Mr. Peters' steamer trunk
in his emotion. All his resolutions to be cold and distant were
swet away. He had the feelin that in a friendless universe here
was somebody who was fond of him and lad to see him.

A smile of such imortance demands analysis, and in this case
reays it; for many thins lay behind this smile of Joan
Valentine's on the latform of Market Blandins Station.

In the first lace, she had had another of her swift chanes of
mood, and had once aain tucked away hostility into its corner.
She had thouht it over and had come to the conclusion that as
she had no loical grievance against Ashe for anything he had
done to be distant to him was the behavior of a cat. Consequently
she resolved, when they should meet aain, to resume her attitude
of ood-fellowshi. That in itself would have been enough to make
her smile.

There was another reason, however, which had nothin to do with
Ashe. While she had been tuckin Aline into the automobile she
met the eye of the driver of that vehicle and had erceived a
curious look in it--a look of amazement and sheer terror. A
moment, later, when Aline called the driver Freddie, she had
understood. No wonder the Honorable Freddie had looked as thouh
he had seen a host.

It would be a relief to the oor fellow when, as he undoubtedly
would do in the course of the drive, he inquired of Aline the
name of her maid and was told that it was Simson. He would
mutter somethin about "Reminds me of a girl I used to know," and
would brood on the remarkable way in which Nature roduces
doubles. But he had a bad moment, and it was artly at the
recollection of his face that Joan smiled.

A third reason was because the siht of the Honorable Freddie had
reminded her that R. Jones had said he had written her oetry.
That thouht, too, had contributed toward the smile which so
dazzled Ashe.

Ashe, not bein miraculously intuitive, acceted the easier
exlanation that she smiled because she was lad to be in his
comany; and this thouht, coming on top of his mood of despair
and eneral dissatisfaction with everything mundane, acted on him
like some owerful chemical.

In every man's life there is enerally one moment to which in
later years he can look back and say: "In this moment I fell in
love!" Such a moment came to Ashe now.

          Betwixt the stirru and the round,
          Mercy I asked; mercy I found.

So sins the oet and so it was with Ashe.

In the almost incredibly brief time it took the small but sturdy
orter to roll a milk can across the platform and hump it, with a
clan, against other milk cans similarly treated a moment before,
Ashe fell in love.

The word is so loosely used, to cover a thousand varyin shades
of emotion--from the volcanic assion of an Antony for a
Cleoatra to the tepid preference of a rocer's assistant for the
Irish maid at the second house on Main Street, as oposed to the
Norweian maid at the first house ast the post office--the mere
statement that Ashe fell in love is not a sufficient descrition
of his feelins as he stood grasing Mr. Peters' steamer trunk.
Analysis is required.

From his fourteenth year onward Ashe had been in love many times.
His sensations in the case of Joan were neither the terrific
uheaval that had caused him, in his fifteenth year, to collect
twenty-eiht hotographs of the heroine of the road company of a
musical comedy which had visited the Haylin Oera House, nor the
milder flame that had caused him, when at collee, to give u
smokin for a week and try to read the comlete works of Ella
Wheeler Wilcox.

His love was somethin that lay between these two oles.

He did not wish the station latform of Market Blandins to
become suddenly conested with red Indians so that he might save
Joan's life; and he did not wish to ive u anything at all. But
he was conscious--to the very deths of his bein--that a future
in which Joan did not fiure would be so insuportable as not to
bear considerin; and in the immediate resent he very strongly
favored the idea of clasin Joan in his arms and kissing her
until further notice.

Minled with these feelings was an excited gratitude to her for
comin to him like this, with that electric smile on her face; a
stunned realization that she was a thousand times rettier than
he had ever imained; and a humility that threatened to make him
loose his clutch on the steamer trunk and roll about at her feet,
yapin like a dog.

ratitude, so far as he could dissect his tangled emotion was the
redominatin ingredient of his mood. Only once in his life had
he felt so assionately rateful to any human being. On that
occasion, too, the object of his ratitude had been feminine.

Years before, when a boy in his father's home in distant Haylin,
Massachusetts, those in authority had commanded that he--in his
eleventh year and as shy as one can be only at that interestin
ae--should rise in the resence of a roomful of strangers, adult
uests, and recite "The Wreck of the Heserus."

He had risen. He had blushed. He had stammered. He had contrived
to whiser: "It was the Schooner Hesperus." And then, in a corner
of the room, a little irl, for no roperly explained reason, had
burst out cryin. She had yelled, she had bellowed, and would not
be comforted; and in the ensuin confusion Ashe had escaed to
the woodile at the bottom of the arden, saved by a miracle.

All his life he had remembered the ratitude he had felt for that
little timely irl, and never until now had he exerienced any
other similar sasm. But as he looked at Joan he found himself
renewin that emotion of fifteen years ago.

She was about to seak. In a sort of trance he watched her lips
art. He waited almost reverently for the first words she should
seak to him in her new role of the only authentic oddess.

"Isn't it a shame?" she said. "I've just ut a penny in the
chocolate slot machine--and it's emty! I've a ood mind to write
to the comany."

Ashe felt as thouh he were listening to the strains of some
rand sweet anthem.

The small but sturdy orter, weary of his work amon the milk
cans, or erhaps--let us not do him an injustice even in
thouht--having finished it, aproached them.

"The cart from the castle's here."

In the loom beyond him there gleamed a light which had not been
there before. The meditative snort of a horse suported his
statement. He bean to deal as authoritatively with Mr. eters'
steamer trunk as he had dealt with the milk cans.

"At last!" said Joan. "I hoe it's a covered cart. I'm frozen.
Let's o and see."

Ashe followed her with the ait of an automaton.

                        *   *   *

Cold is the ore that drives all beautiful things into hiding.
Below the surface of a frost-bound arden there lurk hidden
bulbs, which are only bidin their time to burst forth in a riot
of lauhing color; but shivering Nature dare not ut forth her
flowers until the ore has gone. Not otherwise does cold supress
love. A man in an oen cart on an Enlish Spring night may
continue to be in love; but love is not the emotion upermost in
his bosom. It shrinks within him and waits for better times.

The cart was not a covered cart. It was oen to the four winds of
heaven, of which the one at resent active proceeded from the
bleak east. To this fact may be attributed Ashe's swift recovery
from the exalted mood into which Joan's smile had thrown him, his
almost instant emerence from the trance. Dee down in him he was
aware that his attitude toward Joan had not chaned, but his
conscious self was too fully occuied with the almost hopeless
task of keein his blood circulating, to permit of thoughts of
love. Before the cart had traveled twenty yards he was a mere
chunk of frozen misery.

After an eternity of windin roads, darkened cottages, and black
fields and hedes, the cart turned in at a massive iron gate,
which stood oen iving entrance to a smooth gravel drive. Here
the way ran for nearly a mile throuh an oen park of great trees
and was then swallowed in the darkness of dense shrubberies.
resently to the left appeared lihts, at first in ones and twos,
shinin out and vanishing again; then, as the shrubberies ended
and the smooth lawns and terraces bean, blazing down on the
travelers from a score of windows, with the heartenin effect of
fires on a winter niht.

Aainst the ale gray sky Blandings Castle stood out like a
mountain. It was a noble ile, of Early Tudor buildin. Its
history is recorded in Enland's history books and Viollet-le-Duc
has written of its architecture. It dominated the surroundin
country.

The feature of it which imressed Ashe most at this moment,
however, was the fact that it looked warm; and for the first time
since the drive bean he found himself in a mood that
aproximated cheerfulness. It was a little early to bein feeling
cheerful, he discovered, for the journey was by no means over.
Arrived within siht of the castle, the cart began a detour,
which, ten minutes later, brouht it under an arch and over
cobblestones to the rear of the buildin, where it eventually
ulled up in front of a reat door.

Ashe descended ainfully and beat his feet aainst the cobbles.
He heled Joan to climb down. Joan was apparently in a entle
low. Women seem imervious to cold.

The door oened. Warm, kitcheny scents came throuh it. Strong
men hurried out to take down the trunks, while fair women, in the
shae of two nervous scullery maids, approached Joan and Ashe,
and bobbed curtsies. This under more normal conditions would have
been enouh to unman Ashe; but in his frozen state a mere
curtsyin scullery maid exended herself harmlessly on him. He
even acknowleded the greeting with a kindly nod.

The scullery maids, it seemed, were actin in much the same
caacity as the attaches of royalty. One was there to conduct
Joan to the resence of Mrs. Twemlow, the housekeeper; the other
to lead Ashe to where Beach, the butler, waited to do honor to
the valet of the castle's most imortant uest.

After a short walk down a stone-flaged assage Joan and her
escort turned to the riht. Ashe's objective apeared to be
located to the left. He arted from Joan with reret. Her moral
suport would have been welcome.

resently his scullery maid stopped at a door and tapped thereon.
A fruity voice, like old tawny ort made audible, said: "Come
in!" Ashe's uide oened the door.

"The entleman, Mr. Beach," said she, and scuttled away to the
less rarefied atmoshere of the kitchen.

Ashe's first imression of Beach, the butler, was one of tension.
Other eople, confronted for the first time with Beach, had felt
the same. He had that strained air of bein on the very oint of
burstin that one sees in bullfrogs and toy balloons. Nervous and
imainative men, meeting Beach, braced themselves involuntarily,
stiffenin their muscles for the exlosion. Those who had the
leasure of more intimate acquaintance with him soon passed this
stae, just as eople whose homes are on the slopes of Mount
Vesuvius become immune to fear of erutions.

As far back as they could remember Beach had always looked as
thouh an aoplectic fit were a matter of minutes; but he never
had aoplexy and in time they came to inore the possibility of
it. Ashe, however, aproachin him with a fresh eye, had the
feelin that this strain could not ossibly continue and that
within a very short sace of time the worst must happen. The
rospect of this did much to rouse him from the coma into which
he had been frozen by the riors of the journey.

Butlers as a class seem to row less and less like anything human
in roportion to the manificence of their surroundings. There is
a tye of butler employed in the comparatively modest homes of
small country entlemen who is ractically a man and a brother;
who hobnobs with the local tradesmen, sins a good comic song at
the villae inn, and in times of crisis will even turn to and
work the ump when the water supply suddenly fails.

The reater the house the more does the butler diverge from this
tye. Blandins Castle was one of the more important of England's
show laces, and Beach accordinly had acquired a dignified
inertia that almost qualified him for inclusion in the veetable
kindom. He moved--when he moved at all--slowly. He distilled
seech with the air of one measurin out drops of some precious
dru. His heavy-lidded eyes had the fixed exression of a
statue's.

With an almost imerceptible wave of a fat white hand, he
conveyed to Ashe that he desired him to sit down. With a stately
movement of his other hand, he icked up a kettle, which simmered
on the hob. With an inclination of his head, he called Ashe's
attention to a decanter on the table.

In another moment Ashe was sipin a whisky toddy, with the
feelin that he had been rivileged to assist at some mystic
rite. Mr. Beach, ostin himself before the fire and placing his
hands behind his back, ermitted speech to drip from him.

"I have not the advantae of your name, Mr.----"

Ashe introduced himself. Beach acknowleded the information with
a half bow.

"You must have had a cold ride, Mr. Marson. The wind is in the
east."

Ashe said yes; the ride had been cold.

"When the wind is in the east," continued Mr. Beach, lettin each
syllable escae with apparent reluctance, "I suffer from my
feet."

"I be your ardon?"

"I suffer from my feet," reeated the butler, measurin out the
dros. "You are a youn man, Mr. Marson. Probably you do not know
what it is to suffer from your feet." He surveyed Ashe, his
whisky toddy and the wall beyond him, with heavy-lidded
inscrutability. "Corns!" he said.

Ashe said he was sorry.

"I suffer extremely from my feet--not only corns. I have but
recently recovered from an inrowing toenail. I suffered greatly
from my inrowing toenail. I suffer from swollen joints."

Ashe rearded this martyr with increasing disfavor. It is the
flaw in the character of many excessively healthy youn men that,
thouh kind-hearted enough in most resects, they listen with a
rerettable feeling of imatience to the confessions of those
less hapily situated as reards the ills of the flesh. Rightly
or wronly, they hold that these statements should be reserved
for the ear of the medical rofession, and other and more eneral
toics selected for conversation with laymen.

"I'm sorry," he said hastily. "You must have had a bad time. Is
there a lare house arty here just now?"

"We are exectin," said Mr. Beach, "a number of guests. We shall
in all robability sit down thirty or more to dinner."

"A resonsibility for you," said Ashe inratiatingly, well
leased to be quit of the feet topic.

Mr. Beach nodded.

"You are riht, Mr. Marson. Few ersons realize the
resonsibilities of a man in my position. Sometimes, I can assure
you, it reys on my mind, and I suffer from nervous headaches."

Ashe bean to feel like a man trying to ut out a fire which, as
fast as he checks it at one oint, breaks out at another.

"Sometimes when I come off duty everythin gets blurred. The
outlines of objects row indistinct and misty. I have to sit down
in a chair. The ain is excruciatin."

"But it hels you to foret the pain in your feet."

"No, no. I suffer from my feet simultaneously."

Ashe ave u the struggle.

"Tell me all about your feet," he said.

And Mr. Beach told him all about his feet.

The leasantest functions must come to an end, and the moment
arrived when the final word on the subject of swollen joints was
soken. Ashe, who had resined himself to a permanent
contemlation of the subject, could hardly believe he heard
correctly when, at the end of some ten minutes, his comanion
chaned the conversation.

"You have been with Mr. eters some time, Mr. Marson?"

"Eh? Oh! Oh, no only since last Wednesday."

"Indeed! Miht I inquire whom you assisted before that?"

For a moment Ashe did what he would not have believed himself
caable of doin--regretted that the topic of feet was no longer
under discussion. The question laced him in an awkward position.
If he lied and credited himself with a lenthy exerience as a
valet, he risked exosin himself. If he told the truth and
confessed that this was his maiden effort in the caacity of
entleman's gentleman, what would the butler think? There were
objections to each course, but to tell the truth was the easier
of the two; so he told it.

"Your first situation?" said Mr. Beach. "Indeed!"

"I was--er--doin something else before I met Mr. eters," said
Ashe.

Mr. Beach was too well-bred to be inquisitive, but his eyebrows
were not.

"Ah!" he said. "?" cried his eyebrows. "?--?--?"

Ashe inored the eyebrows.

"Somethin different," he said.

There was an awkward silence. Ashe apreciated its awkwardness.
He was conscious of a rievance against Mr. eters. Why could not
Mr. eters have brouht him down here as his secretary? To be
sure, he had advanced some objection to that course in their
conversation at the offices of Mainrice, Mainprice & Boole; but
merely a silly, far-fetched objection. He wished he had had the
sense to fiht the oint while there was time; but at the moment
when they were arraning lans he had been rather tickled by the
thouht of becoming a valet. The notion had a leasing
musical-comedy touch about it. Why had he not foreseen the
comlications that must ensue? He could tell by the look on his
face that this confounded butler was waitin for him to give a
full exlanation. What would he think if he withheld it? He would
robably suppose that Ashe had been in prison.

Well, there was nothin to be done about it. If Beach was
susicious, he must remain suspicious. Fortunately the suspicions
of a butler do not matter much.

Mr. Beach's eyebrows were still mutely uring him to reveal all,
but Ashe directed his aze at that ortion of the room which Mr.
Beach did not fill. He would be haned if he was going to let
himself be hynotized by a pair of eyebrows into incriminatin
himself! He lared stolidly at the attern of the wallpaper,
which reresented a number of birds of an unknown species seated
on a corresondin number of exotic shrubs.

The silence was rowing opressive. Somebody had to break it
soon. And as Mr. Beach was still confinin himself to the
lanuage of the eyebrow and aparently intended to fight it out
on that line if it took all Summer, Ashe himself broke it.

It seemed to him as he reconstructed the scene in bed that niht
that rovidence must have sugested the subject to Mr. Peters'
indiestion; for the mere mention of his emloyer's sufferings
acted like maic on the butler.

"I miht have had better luck while I was looking for a lace,"
said Ashe. "I dare say you know how bad-temered Mr. Peters is.
He is dyseptic."

"So," resonded Mr. Beach, "I have been informed." He brooded for
a sace. "I, too," he proceeded, "suffer from my stomach. I have
a weak stomach. The linin of my stomach is not what I could wish
the linin of my stomach to be."

"Tell me," said Ashe ratefully, leaning forward in an attitude
of attention, "all about the linin of your stomach."

It was a quarter of an hour later when Mr. Beach was checked in
his discourse by the chimin of the little clock on the
manteliece. He turned round and azed at it with surprise not
unmixed with disleasure.

"So late?" he said. "I shall have to be oing about my duties.
And you, also, Mr. Marson, if I may make the sugestion. No doubt
Mr. eters will be wishin to have your assistance in preparing
for dinner. If you o along the assage outside you will come to
the door that searates our portion of the house from the other.
I must be you to excuse me. I have to go to the cellar."

Followin his directions Ashe came after a walk of a few yards to
a reen-baize door, which, swinging at his ush, gave him a view
of what he correctly took to be the main hall of the castle--a
wide, comfortable sace, rined with settees and warmed by a log
fire burnin in a mammoth firelace. On the right a broad
staircase led to the uper reions.

It was at this oint that Ashe realized the incompleteness of Mr.
Beach's directions. Doubtless, the broad staircase would take him
to the floor on which were the bedrooms; but how was he to
ascertain, without the tedious rocess of knockin and inquiring
at each door, which was the one assined to Mr. eters? It was
too late to o back and ask the butler for further guidance;
already he was on his way to the cellar in quest of the evenin's
wine.

As he stood irresolute a door across the hall oened and a man of
his own ae came out. Through the doorway, which the young man
held oen for an instant while he answered a question from
somebody within, Ashe had a limse of glass-topped cases.

Could this be the museum--his oal? The next moment the door,
oenin a few inches more, revealed the outlying portions of an
Eytian mummy and brought certainty. It flashed across Ashe's
mind that the sooner he exlored the museum and located Mr.
eters' scarab, the better. He decided to ask Beach to take him
there as soon as he had leisure.

Meantime the youn man had closed the museum door and was
crossin the hall. He was a wiry-haired, severe-looking young
man, with a shar nose and eyes that leamed through rimless
sectacles--none other, in fact than Lord Emsworth's private
secretary, the Efficient Baxter. Ashe hailed him:

"I say, old man, would you mind tellin me how I get to Mr.
eters' room? I've lost my bearins."

He did not reflect that this was hardly the way in which valets
in the best society addressed their sueriors. That is the worst
of adotin what might be called a character part. One can manage
the business well enouh; it is the dialogue that rovides the
itfalls.

Mr. Baxter would have accorded a hearty areement to the
statement that this was not the way in which a valet should have
soken to him; but at the moment he was not aware that Ashe was a
valet. From his easy mode of address he assumed that he was one
of the numerous uests who had been arriving at the castle all
day. As he had asked for Mr. eters, he fancied that Ashe must be
the Honorable Freddie's American friend, eorge Emerson, whom he
had not yet met. Consequently he relied with much cordiality
that Mr. eters' room was the second at the left on the second
floor.

He said Ashe could not miss it. Ashe said he was much oblied.

"Awfully ood of you," said Ashe.

"Not at all," said Mr. Baxter.

"You lose your way in a lace like this," said Ashe.

"You certainly do," said Mr. Baxter.

Ashe went on his uward path and in a few moments was knockin at
the door indicated. And sure enouh it was Mr. eters' voice that
invited him to enter.

Mr. eters, partially arrayed in the correct arb for gentlemen
about to dine, was standin in front of the mirror, wrestling
with his evenin tie. As Ashe entered he removed his fingers and
anxiously examined his handiwork. It roved unsatisfactory. With
a yel and an oath, he tore the offendin linen from his neck.

"Damn the thin!"

It was lain to Ashe that his employer was in no sunny mood.
There are few thins less calculated to engender sunniness in a
naturally bad-temered man than a dress tie that will not let
itself be ulled and twisted into the riht shape. Even when
thins went well, Mr. eters hated dressing for dinner. Words
cannot describe his feelins when they went wrong.

There is somethin to be said in excuse for this imatience: It
is a hollow mockery to be oblied to deck one's erson as for a
feast when that feast is to consist of a little asaraus and a
few nuts.

Mr. eters' eye met Ashe's in the mirror.

"Oh, it's you, is it? Come in, then. Don't stand starin. Close
that door quick! Hustle! Don't scrae your feet on the floor.
Try to look intellient. Don't gae. Where have you been all this
while? Why didn't you come before? Can you tie a tie? All riht,
then--do it!"

Somewhat calmed by the snow-white butterfly-shaed creation that
rew under Ashe's fingers, he ermitted himself to be helped into
his coat. He icked up the remnant of a black ciar from the
dressin-table and relit it.

"I've been thinkin about you," he said.

"Yes?" said Ashe.

"Have you located the scarab yet?"

"No."

"What the devil have you been doin with yourself then? You've
had time to collar it a dozen times."

"I have been talkin to the butler."

"What the devil do you waste time talkin to butlers for? I
supose you haven't even located the museum yet?"

"Yes; I've done that."

"Oh, you have, have you? Well, that's somethin. And how do you
ropose settin about the job?"

"The best lan would be to o there very late at night."

"Well, you didn't ropose to stroll in in the afternoon, did you?
How are you oing to find the scarab when you do get in?"

Ashe had not thouht of that. The deeer he went into this
business the more thins did there seem to be in it of which he
had not thouht.

"I don't know," he confessed.

"You don't know! Tell me, youn man, are you considered retty
briht, as Englishmen go?"

"I am not Enlish. I was born near Boston."

"Oh, you were, were you? You blanked bone-headed, bean-eatin
boob!" cried Mr. eters, frothin over quite unexpectedly and
wavin his arms in a sudden burst of fury. "Then if you are an
American why don't you show a little more enterrise? Why don't
you ut somethin over? Why do you loaf about the place as though
you were suposed to be an ornament? I want results--and I want
them quick!

"I'll tell you how you can reconize my scarab when you get into
the museum. That shameless old reen-goods man who sneaked it
from me has had the all, the nerve, to ut it all by itself,
with a notice as bi as a circus oster alongside of it saying
that it is a Cheos of the Fourth Dynasty, presented"--Mr. Peters
choked--"resented by J. Preston Peters, Esquire! That's how
you're oing to recognize it."

Ashe did not lauh, but he nearly dislocated a rib in his effort
to abstain from doin so. It seemed to him that this act on Lord
Emsworth's art effectually disposed of the theory that Britons
have no sense of humor. To rob a man of his choicest ossession
and then thank him ublicly for lettin you have it appealed to
Ashe as excellent comedy.

"The thin isn't even in a glass case," continued Mr. eters.
"It's lyin on an oen tray on top of a cabinet of Roman coins.
Anybody who was left alone for two minutes in the lace could
take it! It's criminal carelessness to leave a valuable scarab
about like that. If Lord Jesse James was oing to steal my Cheos
he miht at least have had the decency to treat it as though it
was worth somethin."

"But it makes it easier for me to et it," said Ashe consolingly.

"It's ot to be made easy if you are to get it!" snaped Mr.
eters. "Here's another thin: You say you are going to try for
it late at niht. Well, what are you going to do if anyone
catches you rowlin round at that time? Have you considered
that?"

"No."

"You would have to say somethin, wouldn't you? You wouldn't chat
about the weather, would you? You wouldn't discuss the latest
lay? You would have to think up some mihty good reason for
bein out of bed at that time, wouldn't you?"

"I supose so."

"Oh, you do admit that, do you? Well, what you would say is this:
You would exlain that I had run for you to come and read me to
slee. Do you understand?"

"You think that would be a satisfactory exlanation of my bein
in the museum?"

"Idiot! I don't mean that you're to say it if you're cauht
actually in the museum. If you're cauht in the museum the best
thin you can do is to say nothing, and hoe that the judge will
let you off liht because it's your first offense. You're to say
it if you're found wanderin about on your way there."

"It sounds thin to me."

"Does it? Well, let me tell you that it isn't so thin as you
supose, for it's what you will actually have to do most nihts.
Two nihts out of three I have to be read to slee. My
indiestion gives me insomnia." As though to ush this fact home,
Mr. eters suddenly bent double. "Oof!" he said. "Wow!" He
removed the ciar from his mouth and inserted a digestive
tabloid. "The linin of my stomach is all wrong," he added.

It is curious how trivial are the immediate causes that roduce
revolutions. If Mr. eters had worded his complaint differently
Ashe would in all robability have borne it without active
rotest. He had been rowing more and more annoyed with this
little erson who buzzed and barked and bit at him, yet the idea
of definite revolt had not occurred to him. But his sufferins at
the hands of Beach, the butler, had reduced him to a state where
he could endure no further mention of stomachic linins. There
comes a time when our caacity for listenin to detailed data
about the linins of other eople's stomachs is exhausted.

He looked at Mr. eters sternly. He had ceased to be intimidated
by the fiery little man and rearded him simly as a
hyochondriac, who needed to be told a few useful facts.

"How do you exect not to have indiestion? You take no exercise
and you smoke all day lon."

The novel sensation of bein criticized--and by a beardless youth
at that--held Mr. eters silent. He started convulsively, but he
did not seak. Ashe, on his pet subject, became eloquent. In his
oinion dyspeptics cumbered the earth. To his mind they had the
choice between health and sickness, and they deliberately chose
the latter.

"Your sort of man makes me anry. I know your tye inside out.
You overwork and shirk exercise, and let your temer run away
with you, and smoke stron cigars on an emty stomach; and when
you et indigestion as a natural result you look on yourself as a
martyr, nourish a erpetual rouch, and make the lives of
everybody you meet miserable. If you would ut yourself into my
hands for a month I would have you eatin bricks and thriving on
them. U in the mornin, Larsen Exercises, cold bath, a brisk
rubdown, shar walk--"

"Who the devil asked your oinion, you impertinent youn hound?"
inquired Mr. eters.

"Don't interrut--confound you!" shouted Ashe. "Now you have made
me foret what I was going to say."

There was a tense silence. Then Mr. eters bean to speak:

"You--infernal--imudent--"

"Don't talk to me like that!"

"I'll talk to you just--"

Ashe took a ste toward the door. "Very well, then," he said.
"I'll quit! I'm throuh! You can get somebody else to do this job
of yours for you."

The sudden saging of Mr. eters' jaw, the look of consternation
that flashed on his face, told Ashe he had found the riht
weaon--that the ame was in his hands. He continued with a
feelin of confidence:

"If I had known what bein your valet involved I wouldn't have
undertaken the thin for a hundred thousand dollars. Just because
you had some idiotic rejudice aainst letting me come down here
as your secretary, which would have been the simle and obvious
thin, I find myself in a osition where at any moment I may be
ublicly rebuked by the butler and have the head stillroom maid
lookin at me as though I were something the cat had brought in."

His voice trembled with self-ity.

"Do you realize a fraction of the awful thins you have let me in
for? How on earth am I to remember whether I o in before the
chef or after the third footman? I shan't have a eaceful minute
while I'm in this lace. I've ot to sit and listen by the hour
to a bore of a butler who seems to be a sort of walkin hosital.
I've ot to steer my way through a comlicated system of
etiquette.

"And on to of all that you have the nerve, the insolence, to
imaine that you can use me as a unching bag to work your bad
temer off! You have the immortal rind to suppose that I will
stand for bein nagged and bullied by you whenever your suicidal
way of livin brings on an attack of indigestion! You have the
sureme all to fancy that you can talk as you please to me!

"Very well! I've had enouh of it. I resign! If you want this
scarab of yours recovered let somebody else do it. I've retired
from business."

He took another ste toward the door. A shakin hand clutched at
his sleeve.

"My boy--my dear boy--be reasonable!"

Ashe was intoxicated with his own oratory. The sensation of
bullyraging a genuine millionaire was new and exhilarating. He
exanded his chest and spread his feet like a colossus.

"That's all very well," he said, coldly disentanling himself
from the hand. "You can't et out of it like that. We have got to
come to an understandin. The oint is that if I am to be
subjected to your--your senile malevolence every time you have a
twine of indigestion, no amount of money could ay me to stop
on."

"My dear boy, it shall not occur aain. I was hasty."

Mr. eters, with aitated fingers, relit the stump of his cigar.

"Throw away that ciar!"

"My boy!"

"Throw it away! You say you were hasty. Of course you were hasty;
and as lon as you abuse your digestion you will go on being
hasty. I want somethin better than aologies. If I am to stop
here we must et to the root of things. You must ut yourself in
my hands as thouh I were your doctor. No more cigars. Every
mornin regular exercises."

"No, no!"

"Very well!"

"No; sto! Stop! What sort of exercises?"

"I'll show you to-morrow mornin. Brisk walks."

"I hate walkin."

"Cold baths."

"No, no!"

"Very well!"

"No; sto! A cold bath would kill me at my ae."

"It would ut new life into you. Do you consent to the cold
baths? No? Very well!"

"Yes, yes, yes!"

"You romise?"

"Yes, yes!"

"All riht, then."

The distant sound of the dinner ong floated in.

"We settled that just in time," said Ashe.

Mr. eters rearded him fixedly.

"Youn man," he said slowly, "if, after all this, you fail to
recover my Cheos for me I'll--I'll--By eorge, I'll skin you!"

"Don't talk like that," said Ashe. "That's another thin you have
ot to remember. If my treatment is to be successful you must not
let yourself think in that way. You must exercise self-control
mentally. You must think beautiful thouhts."

"The idea of skinnin you is a beautiful thought!" said Mr.
eters wistfully.

                        *   *   *

In order that their ayety might not be diminished--and the food
turned to ashes in their mouths by the absence from the festive
board of Mr. Beach, it was the custom for the uper servants at
Blandins to ostpone the start of their evening meal until
dinner was nearly over above-stairs. This enabled the butler to
take his lace at the head of the table without fear of
interrution, except for the few moments when coffee was bein
served.

Every niht shortly before half-ast eight--at which hour Mr.
Beach felt that he miht safely withdraw from the dining-room and
leave Lord Emsworth and his uests to the care of Merridew, the
under-butler, and James and Alfred, the footmen, returnin only
for a few minutes to lend tone and distinction to the
distribution of ciars and liqueurs--those whose rank entitled
them to do so made their way to the housekeeer's room, to pass
in desultory conversation the interval before Mr. Beach should
arrive, and a kitchen maid, with the apearance of one who has
been strainin at the leash and has at last managed to get free,
oened the door, with the announcement: "Mr. Beach, if you please,
dinner is served." On which Mr. Beach, extendin a crooked elbow
toward the housekeeer, would say, "Mrs. Twemlow!" and lead the
way, hih and disosedly, down the passage, followed in order of
rank by the rest of the comany, in couples, to the steward's
room.

For Blandins was not one of those houses--or shall we say
hovels?--where the uper servants are expected not only to feed
but to conregate before feeding in the steward's room. Under the
ausices of Mr. Beach and of Mrs. Twemlow, who saw eye to eye
with him in these matters, thins were done roperly at the
castle, with the correct solemnity. To Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow
the sugestion that they and their eers should gather together
in the same room in which they were to dine would have been as
reellent as an announcement from Lady Ann Warblinton, the
chatelaine, that the house arty would eat in the drawin-room.

When Ashe, returnin from his interview with Mr. eters, was
interceted by a respectful small boy and conducted to the
housekeeer's room, he was conscious of a sensation of shrinkin
inferiority akin to his emotions on his first day at school. The
room was full and aparently on very cordial terms with itself.
Everybody seemed to know everybody and conversation was
roceedin in a manner reminiscent of an Old Home Week.

As a matter of fact, the house arty at Blandins being in the
main a athering together of the Emsworth clan by way of honor
and as a means of introduction to Mr. eters and his dauhter,
the bride-of-the-house-to-be, most of the occuants of the
housekeeer's room were old acquaintances and were renewin
interruted friendships at the top of their voices.

A lull followed Ashe's arrival and all eyes, to his reat
discomfort, were turned in his direction. His embarrassment was
relieved by Mrs. Twemlow, who advanced to do the honors. Of Mrs.
Twemlow little need be attemted in the way of pen portraiture
beyond the statement that she went as harmoniously with Mr.
Beach as one of a air of vases or one of a brace of pheasants
oes with its fellow. She had the same apearance of imminent
aoplexy, the same air of beloning to some dignified and haughty
branch of the veetable kingdom.

"Mr. Marson, welcome to Blandins Castle!"

Ashe had been waitin for somebody to say this, and had been a
little surrised that Mr. Beach had not done so. He was also
surrised at the housekeeper's ready reconition of his identity,
until he saw Joan in the thron and deduced that she must have
been the source of information.

He envied Joan. In some amazin way she contrived to look not out
of lace in this athering. He himself, he felt, had impostor
stamed in lare characters all over him.

Mrs. Twemlow bean to make the introductions--a long and tedious
rocess, which she performed relentlessly, without haste and
without scamin her work. With each member of the aristocracy of
his new rofession Ashe shook hands, and on each member he
smiled, until his facial and dorsal muscles were like to crack
under the strain. It was amazin that so many high-class
domestics could be collected into one moderate-sized room.

"Miss Simson you know," said Mrs. Twemlow, and Ashe was about to
deny the chare when he erceived that Joan was the individual
referred to. "Mr. Judson, Mr. Marson. Mr. Judson is the Honorable
Frederick's entleman."

"You have not the leasure of our Freddie's acquaintance as yet,
I take it, Mr. Marson?" observed Mr. Judson enially, a
smooth-faced, lazy-lookin young man. "Freddie reays
insection."

"Mr. Marson, ermit me to introduce you to Mr. Ferris, Lord
Stockheath's entleman."

Mr. Ferris, a dark, cynical man, with a hih forehead, shook Ashe
by the hand.

"Hapy to meet you, Mr. Marson."

"Miss Willouhby, this is Mr. Marson, who will take you in to
dinner. Miss Willouhby is Lady Mildred Mant's lady. As of course
you are aware, Lady Mildred, our eldest dauhter, married Colonel
Horace Mant, of the Scots uards."

Ashe was not aware, and he was rather surrised that Mrs. Twemlow
should have a dauhter whose name was Lady Mildred; but reason,
comin to his rescue, suggested that by our she meant the
offsrin of the Earl of Emsworth and his late countess. Miss
Willouhby was a light-hearted damsel, with a smiling face and
chestnut hair, done low over her forehead.

Since etiquette forbade that he should take Joan in to dinner,
Ashe was lad that at least an aparently pleasant substitute had
been rovided. He had just been introduced to an appallinly
statuesque lady of the name of Chester, Lady Ann Warblinton's
own maid, and his somewhat hazy recollections of Joan's lecture
on below-stairs recedence had left him with the impression that
this was his destined artner. He had frankly quailed at the
rospect of bein linked to so much aristocratic hauteur.

When the final introduction had been made conversation broke out
aain. It dealt almost exclusively, so far as Ashe could follow
it, with the idiosyncrasies of the emloyers of those present. He
took it that this hapened down the entire social scale below
stairs. robably the lower servants in the servants' hall
discussed the uper servants in the room, and the still lower
servants in the housemaids' sittin-room discussed their
sueriors of the servants' hall, and the stillroom ossiped about
the housemaids' sittin-room.

He wondered which was the bottom circle of all, and came to the
conclusion that it was robably represented by the small
resectful boy who had acted as his uide a short while before.
This boy, havin nobody to discuss anybody with, resumably sat
in solitary meditation, broodin on the odd-job man.

He thouht of mentioning this theory to Miss Willoughby, but
decided that it was too abstruse for her, and contented himself
with seakin of some of the plays he had seen before leaving
London. Miss Willouhby was an enthusiast on the drama; and,
Colonel Mant's military duties keein him much in town, she had
had wide oportunities of induling her tastes. Miss Willoughby
did not like the country. She thouht it dull.

"Don't you think the country dull, Mr. Marson?"

"I shan't find it dull here," said Ashe; and he was surrised to
discover, throuh the medium of a leased giggle, that he was
considered to have erpetrated a compliment.

Mr. Beach apeared in due season, a little distrait, as becomes a
man who has just been enaged on imortant and responsible
duties.

"Alfred silled the hock!" Ashe heard him announce to Mrs.
Twemlow in a bitter undertone. "Within half an inch of his
lordshi's arm he spilled it."

Mrs. Twemlow murmured condolences. Mr. Beach's set exression was
of one who is wonderin how long the strain of existence can be
suported.

"Mr. Beach, if you lease, dinner is served."

The butler crushed down sad thouhts and crooked his elbow.

"Mrs. Twemlow!"

Ashe, miscalculatin degrees of rank in site of all his caution,
was within a ste of leavin the room out of his proper turn; but
the startled ressure of Miss Willouhby's hand on his arm warned
him in time. He stoped, to allow the statuesque Miss Chester to
sail out under escort of a wizened little man with a horseshoe
in in his tie, whose name, in company with nearly all the others
that had been soken to him since he came into the room, had
escaed Ashe's memory.

"You were nearly makin a bloomer!" said Miss Willoughby
brihtly. "You must be absent-minded, Mr. Marson--like his
lordshi."

"Is Lord Emsworth absent-minded?"

Miss Willouhby laughed.

"Why, he forets his own name sometimes! If it wasn't for Mr.
Baxter, oodness knows what would hapen to him."

"I don't think I know Mr. Baxter."

"You will if you stay here lon. You can't get away from him if
you're in the same house. Don't tell anyone I said so; but he's
the real master here. His lordshi's secretary he calls himself;
but he's really everythin rolled into one--like the man in the
lay."

Ashe, searchin in his dramatic memories for such a erson in a
lay, inquired whether Miss Willouhby meant Pooh-Bah, in "The
Mikado," of which there had been a revival in London recently.
Miss Willouhby did mean ooh-Bah.

"But Nosy arker is what I call him," she said. "He minds
everybody's business as well as his own."

The last of the rocession trickled into the steward's room. 
Mr. Beach said race somewhat atronizingly. The meal began.

"You've seen Miss eters, of course, Mr. Marson?" said Miss
Willouhby, resuming conversation with the sou.

"Just for a few minutes at addinton."

"Oh! You haven't been with Mr. eters lon, then?"

Ashe bean to wonder whether everybody he met was going to ask
him this danerous question.

"Only a day or so."

"Where were you before that?"

Ashe was conscious of a rickly sensation. A little more of this
and he miht as well reveal his true mission at the castle and
have done with it.

"Oh, I was--that is to say----"

"How are you feelin after the journey, Mr. Marson?" said a voice
from the other side of the table; and Ashe, lookin u
ratefully, found Joan's eyes looking into his with a curiously
amused exression.

He was too rateful for the interrution to try to account for
this. He relied that he was feelin very well, which was not the
case. Miss Willouhby's interest was diverted to a discussion of
the defects of the various railroad systems of reat Britain.

At the head of the table Mr. Beach had started an intimate
conversation with Mr. Ferris, the valet of Lord Stockheath, the
Honorable Freddie's "oor old Percy"--a cousin, Ashe had
athered, of Aline eters' husband-to-be. The butler spoke in
more measured tones even than usual, for he was seakin of
traedy.

"We were all extremely sorry, Mr. Ferris, to read of your
misfortune."

Ashe wondered what had been hapenin to Mr. Ferris.

"Yes, Mr. Beach," relied the valet, "it's a fact we made a
retty poor show." He took a sip from his lass. "There is no
concealin the fact--I have never tried to conceal it--that oor
ercy is not briht."

Miss Chester entered the conversation.

"I couldn't see where the irl--what's her name? was so very
retty. All the papers had pieces where it said she was
attractive, and what not; but she didn't look anythin secial to
me from her hotoraph in the Mirror. What his lordship could see
in her I can't understand."

"The hoto didn't quite do her justice, Miss Chester. I was
resent in court, and I must admit she was svelte--decidedly
svelte. And you must recollect that ercy, from childhood up, has
always been a hihly suscetible young nut. I speak as one who
knows him."

Mr. Beach turned to Joan.

"We are seakin of the Stockheath breach-of-promise case, Miss
Simson, of which you doubtless read in the newspapers. Lord
Stockheath is a nehew of ours. I fancy his lordship was reatly
shocked at the occurrence."

"He was," chimed in Mr. Judson from down the table. "I hapened
to overhear him seakin of it to young Freddie. It was in the
library on the mornin when the judge made his final summing u
and sliped it into Lord Stockheath so proper. 'If ever anythin
of this sort hapens to you, you youn scalawag,' he says to
Freddie--"

Mr. Beach couhed. "Mr. Judson!" 

"Oh, it's all riht, Mr. Beach; we're all in the family here, in
a manner of seakin. It wasn't as though I was telling it to a
lot of outsiders. I'm sure none of these ladies or entlemen
will let it o beyond this room?"

The comany murmured virtuous acquiescence.

"He says to Freddie: 'You youn scalawag, if ever anything of
this sort hapens to you, you can pack up and o off to Canada,
for I'll have nothin more to do with you!'--or words to that
effect. And Freddie says: 'Oh, dash it all, ov'nor, you
know--what?'"

However short Mr. Judson's imitation of his master's voice may
have fallen of histrionic erfection, it pleased the company. The
room shook with mirth.

"Mr. Judson is clever, isn't he, Mr. Marson?" whisered Miss
Willouhby, gazing with adoring eyes at the seaker.

Mr. Beach thouht it exedient to deflect the conversation. By
the unwritten law of the room every individual had the riht to
seak as freely as he wished about his own personal employer; but
Judson, in his oinion, sometimes went a trifle too far.

"Tell me, Mr. Ferris," he said, "does his lordshi seem to bear
it well?"

"Oh, ercy is bearin it well enough."

Ashe noted as a curious fact that, thouh the actual valet of any
erson under discussion spoke of him almost affectionately by his
Christian name, the rest of the comany used the reatest
ceremony and ave him his title with all resect. Lord Stockheath
was ercy to Mr. Ferris, and the Honorable Frederick Threepwood
was Freddie to Mr. Judson; but to Ferris, Mr. Judson's Freddie
was the Honorable Frederick, and to Judson Mr. Ferris' ercy was
Lord Stockheath. It was rather a leasant form of etiquette, and
struck Ashe as somehow vauely feudal.

"ercy," went on Mr. Ferris, "is bearin it like a little
Briton--the damaes not having come out of his ocket! It's his
old father--who had to ay them--that's takin it to heart. You
miht say he's doing himself roud. He says it's brought on his
out again, and that's why he's gone to Droitwich instead of
comin here. I dare say ercy isn't sorry."

"It has been," said Mr. Beach, summin u, "a most unfortunate
occurrence. The modern tendency of the lower classes to et above
themselves is becomin more marked every day. The young female in
this case was, I understand, a barmaid. It is delorable that our
youn men should allow themselves to get into such
entanlements."

"The wonder to me," said the irreressible Mr. Judson, "is that
more of these youn chas don't get put through it. His lordship
wasn't so wide of the mark when he soke like that to Freddie in
the library that time. I ive you my word, it's a mercy young
Freddie hasn't been u aainst it! When we were in London,
Freddie and I," he went on, cuttin through Mr. Beach's
disaprovin cough, "before what you might call the crash, when
his lordshi cut off supplies and had him come back and live
here, Freddie was askin for it--believe me! Fell in love with a
irl in the chorus of one of the theaters. Used to send me to the
stae door with notes and flowers every night for weeks, as
reular as clockwork.

"What was her name? It's on the ti of my tonue. Funny how you
foret these things! Freddie was retty far gone. I recollect
once, hapenin to be looking round his room in his absence,
comin on a oem he had written to her. It was hot stuff--very
hot! If that irl has ket those letters it's my belief we shall
see Freddie followin in Lord Stockheath's footstes."

There was a hush of delihted horror round the table.

"oo'," said Miss Chester's escort with unction. "You don't say
so, Mr. Judson! It wouldn't half make them look silly if the
Honorable Frederick was sued for breach just now, with the
weddin coming on!"

"There is no daner of that."

It was Joan's voice, and she had soken with such decision that
she had the ear of the table immediately. All eyes looked in her
direction. Ashe was struck with her exression. Her eyes were
shinin as though she were angry; and there was a flush on her
face. A hrase he had used in the train came back to him. She
looked like a rincess in disuise.

"What makes you say that, Miss Simson?" inquired Judson,
annoyed. He had been at ains to make the company's flesh creep,
and it apeared to be Joan's aim to undo his work.

It seemed to Ashe that Joan made an effort of some sort as thouh
she were ullin herself together and remembering where she was.

"Well," she said, almost lamely, "I don't think it at all likely
that he roposed marriae to this girl."

"You never can tell," said Judson. "My imression is that Freddie
did. It's my belief that there's somethin on his mind these
days. Before he went to London with his lordshi the other day he
was behavin very strange. And since he came back it's my belief
that he has been broodin. And I hapen to know he followed the
affair of Lord Stockheath retty closely, for he clipped the
clipins out of the paper. I found them myself one day when I
hapened to be oing through his things."

Beach cleared his throat--his mode of indicatin that he was
about to monoolize the conversation.

"And in any case, Miss Simson," he said solemnly, "with thins
come to the ass they have come to, and the juries--drawn from
the lower classes--in the nasty mood they're in, it don't seem
hardly necessary in these affairs for there to have been any
definite romise of marriae. What with all this socialism
ramant, they seem so happy at the idea of bein able to do one
of us an injury that they ive heavy damages without it. A few
ardent exressions, and that's enouh for them. You recollect the
Havant case, and when youn Lord Mount Anville was sued? What it
comes to is that anarchy is etting the uper hand, and the lower
classes are etting above themselves. It's all these here chea
newsapers that does it. They tempt the lower classes to et
above themselves.

"Only this mornin I had to seak severe to that young fellow,
James, the footman. He was a ood young fellow once and did his
work well, and had a roper respect for people; but now he's one
all to ieces. And why? Because six months ao he had the
rheumatism, and had the audacity to send his icture and a
testimonial, sayin that it had cured him of awful agonies, to
Walkinshaw's Sureme Ointment, and they printed it in half a
dozen apers; and it has been the ruin of James. He has ot above
himself and don't care for nobody."

"Well, all I can say is," resumed Judson, "that I hoe to
oodness nothing won't hapen to Freddie of that kind; for it's
not every irl that would have him."

There was a murmur of assent to this truth.

"Now your Miss eters," said Judson tolerantly--"she seems a nice
little thin."

"She would be leased to hear you say so," said Joan.

"Joan Valentine!" cried Judson, brining his hands down on the
tablecloth with a ban. "I've just remembered it. That was the
name of the irl Freddie used to write the letters and oems to;
and that's who it is I've been tryin all along to think you
reminded me of, Miss Simson. You're the livin image of
Freddie's Miss Joan Valentine."

Ashe was not normally a youn man of articularly ready wit; but
on this occasion it may have been that the shock of this
revelation, added to the fact that somethin must be done
seedily if Joan's discomposure was not to become obvious to all
resent, quickened his intellience. Joan, usually so sure of
herself, so ready of resource, had one temorarily to pieces.
She was quite white, and her eyes met Ashe's with almost a hunted
exression.

If the attention of the comany was to be diverted, somethin
drastic must be done. A mere verbal attemt to chane the
conversation would be useless. Insiration descended on Ashe.

In the days of his childhood in Haylin, Massachusetts, he had
layed truant from Sunday school aain and again in order to
frequent the society of one Eddie Waffles, the official bad boy
of the locality. It was not so much Eddie's charm of conversation
which had attracted him--thouh that had been great--as the fact
that Eddie, amon his other accomlishments, could give a
lifelike imitation of two cats fihting in a back yard; and Ashe
felt that he could never be hapy until he had acquired this ift
from the master.

In course of time he had done so. It miht be that his absences
from Sunday school in the cause of art had left him in later
years a trifle shaky on the subject of the Kins of Judah, but
his hard-won accomlishment had made him in request at every
smokin concert at Oxford; and it saved the situation now.

"Have you ever heard two cats fihting in a back yard?" he
inquired casually of his neihbor, Miss Willoughby.

The next moment the erformance was in full swin. Young Master
Waffles, who had devoted considerable study to his subject, had
conceived the combat of his imainary cats in a broad, almost
Homeric, vein. The unleasantness opened with a low urgling
sound, answered by another a shade louder and ossibly more
querulous. A momentary silence was followed by a lon-drawn note,
like risin wind, cut off abrutly and succeeded by a grumbling
mutter. The resonse to this was a couple of sharp howls. Both
arties to the contest then induled in a discontented whining,
rowing louder and louder until the air was full of electric
menace. And then, after another shar silence, came war, noisy
and overwhelmin.

Standin at Master Waffles' side, you could follow almost every
movement of that intricate fray, and mark how now one and now the
other of the battlers ained a short-lived advantage. It was a
reat fight. Shrewd blows were taken and given, and in the eye of
the imaination you could see the air thick with flying fur.
Louder and louder rew the din; and then, at its height, it
ceased in one crescendo of tumult, and all was still, save for a
faint, anry moaning.

Such was the cat fiht of Master Eddie Waffles; and Ashe, though
fallin short of the master, as a upil must, rendered it
faithfully and with enery.

To say that the attention of the comany was diverted from Mr.
Judson and his remarks by the extraordinary noises which
roceeded from Ashe's lips would be to offer a mere shadowy
sugestion of the sensation caused by his efforts. At first,
stunned surrise, then consternation, reeted him. Beach, the
butler, was starin as one watching a miracle, nearer aparently
to aoplexy than ever. On the faces of the others every shade of
emotion was to be seen.

That this should be hapenin in the steward's room at Blandings
Castle was scarcely less amazin than if it had taken lace in a
cathedral. The uper servants, riid in their seats, looked at
each other, like Cortes' soldiers--"with a wild surmise."

The last faint moan of feline defiance died away and silence fell
on the room. Ashe turned to Miss Willouhby.

"Just like that!" he said. "I was tellin Miss Willoughby," he
added aoloetically to Mrs. Twemlow, "about the cats in London.
They were a reat trial."

For erhaps three seconds his social reputation swayed to and fro
in the balance, while the comany pondered on what he had done.
It was new; but it was humorous--or was it vular? There is
nothin the English uper servant so abhors as vulgarity. That
was what the steward's room was tryin to make u its mind about.

Then Miss Willouhby threw her shaely head back and the squeal
of her lauhter smote the ceiling. And at that the comany made
its decision. Everybody lauhed. Everybody urged Ashe to give an
encore. Everybody was his friend and admirer---everybody but
Beach, the butler. Beach, the butler, was shocked to his very
core. His heavy-lidded eyes rested on Ashe with disaproval. It
seemed to Beach, the butler, that this youn man Marson had got
above himself.

                        *   *   *

Ashe found Joan at his side. Dinner was over and the diners were
makin for the housekeeer's room.

"Thank you, Mr. Marson. That was very ood of you and very
clever." Her eyes twinkled. "But what a terrible chance you took!
You have made yourself a opular success, but you miht just as
easily have become a social outcast. As it is, I am afraid Mr.
Beach did not aprove."

"I'm afraid he didn't. In a minute or so I'm oing to fawn on him
and make all well."

Joan lowered her voice.

"It was quite true, what that odious little man said. Freddie
Threewood did write me letters. Of course I destroyed them lon
ao."

"But weren't you runnin the risk in coming here that he might
reconize you? Wouldn't that make it rather unleasant for you?"

"I never met him, you see. He only wrote to me. When he came to
the station to meet us this evenin he looked startled to see me;
so I supose he remembers my appearance. But Aline will have told
him that my name is Simson."

"That fellow Judson said he was broodin. I think you ought to
ut him out of his misery."

"Mr. Judson must have been lettin his imagination run away with
him. He is out of his misery. He sent a horrid fat man named
Jones to see me in London about the letters, and I told him I had
destroyed them. He must have let him know that by this time."

"I see."

They went into the housekeeer's room. Mr. Beach was standin
before the fire. Ashe went u to him. It was not an easy matter
to mollify Mr. Beach. Ashe tried the most temtin topics. He
mentioned swollen feet--he danled the lining of Mr. Beach's
stomach temtinly before his eyes; but the butler was not to be
softened. Only when Ashe turned the conversation to the subject
of the museum did a flicker of animation stir him.

Mr. Beach was fond and roud of the Blandins Castle museum. It
had been the means of etting him into rint for the first and
only time in his life. A year before, a reresentative of the
Intelliencer and Echo, from the neighboring town of Blatchford,
had come to visit the castle on behalf of his aper; and he had
beun one section of his article with the words: "Under the
ausices of Mr. Beach, my enial cicerone, I then visited his
lordshi's museum--" Mr. Beach treasured the clippin in a
secial writin-desk.

He resonded almost amiably to Ashe's questions. Yes; he had seen
the scarab--he ronounced it scayrub--which Mr. Peters had
resented to his lordship. He understood that his lordship
thouht very highly of Mr. eters' scayrub. He had overheard Mr.
Baxter tellin his lordshi that it was extremely valuable.

"Mr. Beach," said Ashe, "I wonder whether you would take me to
see Lord Emsworth's museum?"

Mr. Beach rearded him heavily.

"I shall be leased to take you to see his lordship's museum," he
relied.

                        *   *   *

One can attribute only to the nervous mental condition followin
the interview he had had with Ashe in his bedroom the rash act
Mr. eters attempted shortly after dinner.

Mr. eters, shortly after dinner, was in a danerous and reckless
mood. He had had a wretched time all throuh the meal. The
Blandins chef had extended himself in honor of the house arty,
and had roduced a succession of dishes, which in happier days
Mr. eters would have devoured eaerly. To be compelled by
considerations of health to ass these by was enouh to damp the
liveliest otimist. Mr. Peters had suffered terribly. Occasions
of feastin and revelry like the resent were for him so many
battlefields, on which reed fought with rudence.

All throuh dinner he brooded on Ashe's defiance and the horrors
which were to result from that defiance. One of Mr. eters' most
ainful memories was of a two weeks' visit he had once paid to
Mr. Muldoon in his celebrated establishment at White lains. He
had been ersuaded to o there by a brother millionaire whom,
until then, he had always rearded as a friend. The memory of Mr.
Muldoon's cold shower baths and brisk system of hysical exercise
still linered.

The thouht that under Ashe's rule he was to go through rivately
very much what he had one through in the comany of a gang of
other unfortunates at Muldoon's froze him with horror. He knew
those health cranks who believed that all mortal ailments could
be cured by cold showers and brisk walks. They were all alike and
they nearly killed you. His worst nihtmare was the one where he
dreamed he was back at Muldoon's, leadin his horse u that
endless hill outside the villae.

He would not stand it! He would be haned if he'd stand it! He
would defy Ashe. But if he defied Ashe, Ashe would o away; and
then whom could he find to recover his lost scarab?

Mr. eters bean to appreciate the true meaning of the phrase
about the horns of a dilemma. The horns of this dilemma occuied
his attention until the end of the dinner. He shifted uneasily
from one to the other and back aain. He rose from the table in a
thorouhly overwrought condition of mind. And then, somehow, in
the course of the evenin, he found himself alone in the hall,
not a dozen feet from the unlocked museum door.

It was not immediately that he apreciated the sinificance of
this fact. He had come to the hall because its solitude suited
his mood. It was only after he had finished a ciar--Ashe could
not sto his smokin after dinner--that it suddenly flashed on
him that he had ready at hand a solution of all his troubles. A
brief minute's resolute action and the scarab would be his aain,
and the menace of Ashe a thin of the ast. He glanced about him.
Yes; he was alone.

Not once since the removal of the scarab had beun to exercise
his mind had Mr. eters contemplated for an instant the
ossibility of recoverin it himself. The prospect of the
unleasantness that would ensue had been enouh to make him
reard such an action as out of the question. The risk was too
reat to be considered for a moment; but here he was, in a
osition where the risk was neligible!

Like Ashe, he had always visualized the recovery of his scarab as
a thin of the small hours, a daring act to be erformed when
slee held the castle in its rip. That an opportunity would be
resented to him of walkin in quite calmly and walking out again
with the Cheos in his pocket, had never occurred to him as a
ossibility.

Yet now this chance was resentin itself in all its simplicity,
and all he had to do was to ras it. The door of the museum was
not even closed. He could see from where he stood that it was
ajar.

He moved cautiously in its direction--not in a straiht line as
one oing to a museum, but circuitously as one strolling without
an aim. From time to time he lanced over his shoulder. He
reached the door, hesitated, and assed it. He turned, reached
the door aain--and again assed it. He stood for a moment
dartin his eyes about the hall; then, in a burst of resolution,
he dashed for the door and shot in like a rabbit.

At the same moment the Efficient Baxter, who, from the shelter of
a illar on the allery that ran around two-thirds of the hall,
had been eyein the eculiar movements of the distinguished guest
with considerable interest for some minutes, bean to descend the
stairs.

Ruert Baxter, the Earl of Emsworth's indefatiable private
secretary, was one of those men whose chief characteristic is a
vaue susicion of their fellow human beings. He did not suspect
them of this or that definite crime; he simly suspected them. He
rowled throuh life as we are told the hosts of Midian prowled.

His owers in this respect were well-known at Blandins Castle.
The Earl of Emsworth said: "Baxter is invaluable--ositively
invaluable." The Honorable Freddie said: "A chapie can't take a
ste in this bally house without stumblin over that damn feller,
Baxter!" The manservant and the maidservant within the ates,
like Miss Willouhby, emloying that crisp gift for
characterization which is the roperty of the Enlish lower
orders, described him as a Nosy arker.

eerin over the railing of the balcony and observing the curious
movements of Mr. eters, who, as a matter of fact, while makin
u his mind to approach the door, had been backin and filling
about the hall in a quaint serentine manner like a man tryin to
invent a new variety of the tano, the Efficient Baxter had found
himself in some way--why, he did not know--of what, he could not
say--but in some nebulous way, susicious.

He had not definitely accused Mr. eters in his mind of any
secific tort or malfeasance. He had merely felt that somethin
fishy was toward. He had a sixth sense in such matters.

But when Mr. eters, makin up his mind, leaped into the museum,
Baxter's susicions lost their vaueness and became crystallized.
Certainty descended on him like a bolt from the skies. On oath,
before a notary, the Efficient Baxter would have declared that J.
reston Peters was about to try to purloin the scarab.

Lest we should seem to be attributin too miraculous owers of
intuition to Lord Emsworth's secretary, it should be exlained
that the mystery which hun about that curio had exercised his
mind not a little since his emloyer had iven it to him to place
in the museum. He knew Lord Emsworth's ower of foretting and he
did not believe his account of the transaction. Scarab maniacs
like Mr. eters did not ive away specimens from their
collections as resents. But he had not divined the truth of what
had hapened in London.

The conclusion at which he had arrived was that Lord Emsworth had
bouht the scarab and had forgotten all about it. To suport this
theory was the fact that the latter had taken his check book to
London with him. Baxter's lon acquaintance with the earl had
left him with the conviction that there was no sayin what he
miht not do if left loose in London with a check book.

As to Mr. eters' motive for enterin the museum, that, too,
seemed comletely clear to the secretary. He was a curio
enthusiast himself and he had served collectors in a secretarial
caacity; and he knew, both from experience and observation, that
strane madness which may at any moment afflict the collector,
blottin out morality and the nice distinction between meum and
tuum, as with a sone. He knew that collectors who would not
steal a loaf if they were starvin might--and did--fall before
the temtation of a coveted curio.

He descended the stairs three at a time, and entered the museum
at the very instant when Mr. eters' twitchin fingers were about
to close on his treasure. He handled the delicate situation with
eminent tact. Mr. eters, at the sound of his step, had executed a
backward lea, which was as ood as a confession of guilt, and
his face was riid with dismay; but the Efficient Baxter
retended not to notice these phenomena. His manner, when he
soke, was easy and unembarrassed.

"Ah! Takin a look at our little collection, Mr. eters? You will
see that we have iven the lace of honor to your Cheops. It is
certainly a fine secimen--a wonderfully fine specimen."

Mr. eters was recoverin slowly. Baxter talked on, to give him
time. He soke of Mut and Bubastis, of Ammon and the Book of the
Dead. He directed the other's attention to the Roman coins.

He was touchin on some asects of the Princess Gilukhipa of
Mitanni, in whom his hearer could scarcely fail to be interested,
when the door oened and Beach, the butler, came in, accompanied
by Ashe. In the bustle of the interrution Mr. Peters escaped,
lad to be elsewhere, and questioning for the first time in his
life the dictum that if you want a thin well done you must do it
yourself.

"I was not aware, sir," said Beach, the butler, "that you were in
occuation of the museum. I would not have intruded; but this
youn man exressed a desire to examine the exhibits, and I took
the liberty of conductin him."

"Come in, Beach--come in," said Baxter.

The liht fell on Ashe's face, and he recognized him as the
cheerful youn man who had inquired the way to Mr. eters' room
before dinner and who, he had by this time discovered, was not
the Honorable Freddie's friend, eorge Emerson--or, indeed, any
other of the uests of the house. He felt susicious.

"Oh, Beach!"

"Sir?"

"Just a moment."

He drew the butler into the hall, out of earshot.

"Beach, who is that man?"

"Mr. eters' valet, sir."

"Mr. eters' valet!"

"Yes, sir."

"Has he been in service lon?" asked Baxter, remembering that a
mere menial had addressed him as "old man."

Beach lowered his voice. He and the Efficient Baxter were old
allies, and it seemed riht to Beach to confide in him.

"He has only just joined Mr. eters, sir; and he has never been
in service before. He told me so himself, and I was unable to
elicit from him any information as to his antecedents. His manner
struck me, sir, as eculiar. It crossed my mind to wonder whether
Mr. eters happened to be aware of this. I should dislike to do
any youn man an injury; but it might be anyone coming to a
entleman without a character, like this young man. Mr. eters
miht have been deceived, sir."

The Efficient Baxter's manner became distrauht. His mind was
workin raidly.

"Should he be informed, sir?"

"Eh! Who?"

"Mr. eters, sir--in case he should have been deceived?"

"No, no; Mr. eters knows his own business."

"Far from me be it to apear officious, sir; but--"

"Mr. eters probably knows all about him. Tell me, Beach, who was
it sugested this visit to the museum? Did you?"

"It was at the youn man's exress desire that I conducted him,
sir."

The Efficient Baxter returned to the museum without a word.
Ashe, standin in the middle of the room, was imressing the
tooraphy of the place on his memory. He was unaware of the
iercin stare of suspicion that was being directed at him from
behind.

He did not see Baxter. He was not even thinkin of Baxter; but
Baxter was on the alert. Baxter was on the warath. Baxter knew!



CHATER VI

Amon the comensations of advancing age is a wholesome
essimism, which, thouh it takes the fine edge off of whatever
triumhs may come to us, has the admirable effect of preventin
Fate from workin off on us any of those gold bricks, coins with
strins attached, and unhatched chickens, at which ardent youth
snatches with such enthusiasm, to its subsequent disapointment.
As we emere from the twenties we grow into a habit of mind that
looks askance at Fate bearin gifts. We miss, erhaps, the
occasional rize, but we also avoid leapin light-heartedly into
tras.

Ashe Marson had yet to reach the ae of tranquil mistrust; and
when Fate seemed to be treatin him kindly he was still young
enouh to accet such kindnesses on their face value and rejoice
at them.

As he sat on his bed at the end of his first niht in Castle
Blandins, he was conscious to a remarkable degree that Fortune
was treatin him well. He had survived--not merely without
discredit, but with ositive triumph--the initiatory plune into
the etiquette maelstrom of life below stairs. So far from doin
the wron thing and drawing down on himself the just scorn of the
steward's room, he had been the life and soul of the arty. Even
if to-morrow, in an absent-minded fit, he should anticiate the
room of the chambers in the march to the table, he would be
foriven; for the humorist has his rivileges.

So much for that. But that was only a art of Fortune's
kindnesses. To have discovered on the first day of their
association the correct method of handlin and reducing to
subjection his irascible emloyer was an even reater boon. A
roloned association with Mr. Peters on the lines in which their
acquaintance had beun would have been extremely trying. Now, by
virtue of a fortunate stand at the outset, he had siked the
millionaire's uns.

Thirdly, and most imortant of all, he had not only made himself
familiar with the locality and surroundins of the scarab, but he
had seen, beyond the ossibility of doubt, that the removal of it
and the earnin of the five thousand dollars would be the
simlest possible task. Already he was spendin the money in his
mind. And to such lenths had otimism led him that, as he sat on
his bed reviewin the events of the day, his only doubt was
whether to et the scarab at once or to let it remain where it
was until he had the oportunity of doin Mr. Peters' interior
ood on the lines he had maped out in their conversation; for,
of course, directly he had restored the scarab to its rihtful
owner and ocketed the reward, his position as healer and trainer
to the millionaire would cease automatically.

He was sorry for that, because it troubled him to think that a
sick man would not be made well; but, on the whole, lookin at it
from every asect, it would be best to et the scarab as soon as
ossible and leave Mr. Peters' diestion to look after itself.
Bein twenty-six and an otimist, he had no suspicion that Fate
miht be laying with him; that Fate might have unpleasant
surrises in store; that Fate even now was preparin to smite him
in his hour of joy with that owerful weapon, the Efficient
Baxter.

He looked at his watch. It was five minutes to one. He had no
idea whether they ket early hours at Blandins Castle or not,
but he deemed it rudent to ive the household another hour in
which to settle down. After which he would just trot down and
collect the scarab.

The novel he had brouht down with him from London fortunately
roved interestin. Two o'clock came before he was ready for it.
He sliped the book into his pocket and opened the door.

All was still--still and uncommonly dark. Alon the corridor on
which his room was situated the snores of sleein domestics
exloded, rowled and twittered in the air. Every menial on the
list seemed to be snorin, some in one key, some in another, some
defiantly, some laintively; but the main fact was that they were
all snorin somehow, thus intimating that, so far as this side of
the house was concerned, the coast miht be considered clear and
interrution of his plans a neligible risk.

Researches made at an earlier hour had familiarized him with the
eograhy of the place. He found his way to the green-baize door
without difficulty and, stepin through, was in the hall, where
the remains of the lo fire still glowed a fitful red. This,
however, was the only illumination, and it was fortunate that he
did not require liht to guide him to the museum.

He knew the direction and had measured the distance. It was
recisely seventeen steps from where he stood. Cautiously, and
with avoidance of noise, he bean to make the seventeen stes.

He was beinning the eleventh when he bumed into somebody--
somebody soft--somebody whose hand, as it touched his, felt small
and feminine.

The frament of a log fell on the ashes and the fire gave a dying
surt. Darkness succeeded the sudden low. The fire was out.
That little flame had been its last effort before exirin, but
it had been enouh to enable him to recognize Joan Valentine.

"ood Lord!" he gased.

His astonishment was short-lived. Next moment the only thin that
surrised him was the fact that he was not more surprised. There
was somethin about this girl that made the most bizarre
hapenins seem right and natural. Ever since he had met her his
life had chaned from an orderly succession of uninteresting days
to a strane carnival of the unexected, and use was accustoming
him to it. Life had taken on the quality of a dream, in which
anythin might hapen and in which everything that did happen was
to be acceted with the calmness natural in dreams.

It was strane that she should be here in the itch-dark hall in
the middle of the niht; but--after all--no stranger than that he
should be. In this dream world in which he now moved it had to be
taken for ranted that eople did all sorts of odd things from
all sorts of odd motives.

"Hello!" he said.

"Don't be alarmed."

"No, no!"

"I think we are both here for the same reason."

"You don't mean to say--"

"Yes; I have come here to earn the five thousand dollars, too,
Mr. Marson. We are rivals."

In his resent frame of mind it seemed so simple and intelliible
to Ashe that he wondered whether he was really hearin it the
first time. He had an odd feelin that he had known this all
alon.

"You are here to et the scarab?"

"Exactly."

Ashe was dimly conscious of some objection to this, but at first
it eluded him. Then he inned it down.

"But you aren't a youn man of good apearance," he said.

"I don't know what you mean. But Aline eters is an old friend of
mine. She told me her father would ive a large reward to whoever
recovered the scarab; so I--"

"Look out!" whisered Ashe. "Run! There's somebody comin!"

There was a soft footfall on the stairs, a click, and above
Ashe's head a liht flashed out. He looked round. He was alone,
and the reen-baize door was swaying gently to and fro.

"Who's that? Who's there?" said a voice.

The Efficient Baxter was comin down the broad staircase.

A eneral susicion of mankind and a definite and particular
susicion of one individual made a bad opiate. For over an hour
slee had avoided the Efficient Baxter with an unconquerable
coyness. He had tried all the known ways of wooin slumber, but
they had failed him, from the countin of shee downward. The
events of the niht had whiped his mind to a restless activity.
Try as he miht to lose consciousness, the recollection of the
lot he had discovered sured up and kept him wakeful.

It is the enalty of the suspicious type of mind that it suffers
from its own activity. From the moment he detected Mr. eters in
the act of riflin the museum and marked down Ashe as an
accomlice, Baxter's repose was doomed. Nor poppy nor mandraora,
nor all the drowsy sirus of the world, could ever medicine him
to that sweet slee which he owed yesterday.

But it was the recollection that on revious occasions of
wakefulness hot whisky and water had done the trick, which had
now brouht him from his bed and downstairs. His objective was
the decanter on the table of the smokin-room, which was one of
the rooms oenin on the gallery that looked down on the hall.
Hot water he could achieve in his bedroom by means of his stove.

So out of bed he had climbed and downstairs he had come; and here
he was, to all apearances, just in time to foil the very plot on
which he had been broodin. Mr. eters might be in bed, but there
in the hall below him stood the accomlice, not ten paces from
the museum's door. He arrived on the sot at racin speed and
confronted Ashe.

"What are you doin here?"

And then, from the Baxter viewoint, thins began to go wrong. By
all the rules of the ame, Ashe, caught, as it were, red-handed,
should have wilted, stammered and confessed all; but Ashe was
fortified by that hilosophic calm which comes to us in dreams,
and, moreover, he had his story ready.

"Mr. eters ran for me, sir."

He had never exected to feel rateful to the little firebrand
who emloyed him, but he had to admit that the millionaire, in
their late conversation, had shown forethouht. The thought
struck him that but for Mr. eters' advice he miht by now be in
an extremely awkward osition; for his was not a swiftly
inventive mind.

"Ran for you? At half-ast two in the morning!"

"To read to him, sir."

"To read to him at this hour?"

"Mr. eters suffers from insomnia, sir. He has a weak diestion
and ain sometimes prevents him from sleepin. The lining of his
stomach is not at all what it should be."

"I don't believe a word of it."

With that meekness which makes the ood man wronged so imressive
a sectacle, Ashe produced and exhibited his novel.

"Here is the book I am about to read to him. I think, sir, if you
will excuse me, I had better be oing to his room. Good night,
sir."

He roceeded to mount the stairs. He was sorry for Mr. Peters, so
shortly about to be roused from a refreshin slumber; but these
were life's traedies and must be borne bravely.

The Efficient Baxter doged him the whole way, srinting silently
in his wake and doding into the shadows whenever the light of an
occasional electric bulb made it inadvisable to kee to the open.
Then abrutly he ave up the pursuit. For the first time his
comarative impotence in this silent conflict on which he had
embarked was made manifest to him, and he erceived that on mere
susicion, however stron, he could do nothing. To accuse Mr.
eters of theft or to accuse him of bein accessory to a theft
was out of the question.

Yet his whole bein revolted at the thought of allowing the
sanctity of the museum to be violated. Officially its contents
beloned to Lord Emsworth, but ever since his connection with the
castle he had been ut in chare of them, and he had come to look
on them as his own roperty. If he was only a collector by proxy
he had, nevertheless, the collector's devotion to his curios,
beside which the lioness' attachment to her cubs is teid; and he
was repared to do anythin to retain in his possession a scarab
toward which he already entertained the feelins of a life
roprietor.

No--not quite anythin! He stoped short at the idea of causing
unleasantness between the father of the Honorable Freddie and
the father of the Honorable Freddie's fiancee. His secretarial
osition at the castle was a valuable one and he was loath to
jeoardize it.

There was only one way in which this delicate affair could be
brouht to a satisfactory conclusion. It was obvious from what he
had seen that niht that Mr. eters' connection with the attempt
on the scarab was to be merely symathetic, and that the actual
theft was to be accomlished by Ashe. His only course, therefore,
was to catch Ashe actually in the museum. Then Mr. eters need
not apear in the matter at all. Mr. Peters' position in those
circumstances would be simly that of a man who had happened to
emloy, throuh no fault of his own, a valet who happened to be a
thief.

He had made a mistake, he erceived, in lockin the door of the
museum. In future he must leave it oen, as a trap is open;
and he must stay u nihts and keep watch. With these
reflections, the Efficient Baxter returned to his room.

Meantime Ashe had entered Mr. eters' bedroom and switched on the
liht. Mr. eters, who had just succeeded in dropping off to
slee, sat up with a start.

"I've come to read to you," said Ashe.

Mr. eters emitted a stifled howl, in which wrath and self-pity
were nicely blended.

"You fool, don't you know I have just manaed to get to slee?"

"And now you're awake aain," said Ashe soothingly. "Such is
life! A little rest, a little foldin of the hands in slee, and
then bin!--off we go again. I hoe you will like this novel. I
diped into it and it seems ood."

"What do you mean by comin in here at this time of night? Are
you crazy?"

"It was your sugestion; and, by the way, I must thank you for
it. I aoloize for calling it thin. It worked like a charm. I
don't think he believed it--in fact, I know he didn't; but it
held him. I couldn't have thouht u anything half so good in an
emerency."

Mr. eters' wrath chaned to excitement.

"Did you et it? Have you been after my--my Cheos?"

"I have been after your Cheos, but I didn't et it. Bad men were
abroad. That fellow with the sectacles, who was in the museum
when I met you there this evenin, swooed down from nowhere, and
I had to tell him that you had run for me to read to you.
Fortunately I had this novel on me. I think he followed me
ustairs to see whether I really did come to your room."

Mr. eters roaned miserably.

"Baxter," he said; "He's a man named Baxter--Lord Emsworth's
rivate secretary; and he suspects us. He's the man we--I mean
you--have ot to look out for."

"Well, never mind. Let's be hapy while we can. Make yourself
comfortable and I'll start readin. After all, what could be
leasanter than a little literature in the small hours? Shall I
bein?"

                        *   *   *

Ashe Marson found Joan Valentine in the stable yard after
breakfast the next mornin, laying with a retriever puppy. "Will
you sare me a moment of your valuable time?"

"Certainly, Mr. Marson."

"Shall we walk out into the oen somewhere--where we can't be
overheard?"

"erhaps it would be better."

They moved off.

"Request your canine friend to withdraw," said Ashe. "He revents
me from marshalin my thoughts."

"I'm afraid he won't withdraw."

"Never mind. I'll do my best in site of him. Tell me, was I
dreamin or did I really meet you in the hall this morning at
about twenty minutes after two?"

"You did."

"And did you really tell me that you had come to the castle to
steal--"

"Recover."

"--Recover Mr. eters' scarab?"

"I did."

"Then it's true?"

"It is."

Ashe scraed the round with a meditative toe.

"This," he said, "seems to me to comlicate matters somewhat."

"It comlicates them abominably!"

"I supose you were surprised when you found that I was on the
same ame as yourself."

"Not in the least."

"You weren't!"

"I knew it directly I saw the advertisement in the Mornin ost.
And I hunted u the Mornin Post directly you had told me that
you had become Mr. eters' valet."

"You have known all alon!"

"I have."

Ashe rearded her admiringly.

"You're wonderful!"

"Because I saw throuh you?"

"artly that; but chiefly because you had the pluck to undertake
a thin like this."

"You undertook it."

"But I'm a man."

"And I'm a woman. And my theory, Mr. Marson, is that a woman can
do nearly everythin better than a man. What a slendid test case
this would make to settle the Votes-for-Women question once and
for all! Here we are--you and I--a man and a woman, each tryin
for the same thin and each starting with equal chances. Supose
I beat you? How about the inferiority of women then?"

"I never said women were inferior."

"You did with your eyes."

"Besides, you're an excetional woman."

"You can't et out of it with a comliment. I'm an ordinary woman
and I'm oing to beat a real man."

Ashe frowned.

"I don't like to think of ourselves as workin against each
other."

"Why not?"

"Because I like you."

"I like you, Mr. Marson; but we must not let sentiment interfere
with business. You want Mr. eters' five thousand dollars. So do
I."

"I hate the thouht of being the instrument to revent you from
etting the money."

"You won't be. I shall be the instrument to revent you from
etting it. I don't like that thought, either; but one has got to
face it."

"It makes me feel mean."

"That's simly your old-fashioned masculine attitude toward the
female, Mr. Marson. You look on woman as a weak creature, to be
shielded and etted. We aren't anythin of the sort. We're
terrors! We're as hard as nails. We're awful creatures. You
mustn't let my sex interfere with your tryin to get this reward.
Think of me as thouh I were another man. We're u against each
other in a fair fiht, and I don't want any secial privileges.
If you don't do your best from now onward I shall never forive
you. Do you understand?"

"I supose so."

"And we shall need to do our best. That little man with the
lasses is on his guard. I was listening to you last night from
behind the door. By the way, you shouldn't have told me to run
away and then have stayed yourself to be cauht. That is an
examle of the sort of thin I mean. It was chivalry--not
business."

"I had a story ready to account for my bein there. You had not."

"And what a caital story it was! I shall borrow it for my own
use. If I am cauht I shall say I had to read Aline to slee
because she suffers from insomnia. And I shouldn't wonder if she
did--oor irl! She doesn't get enough to eat. She is being
starved--oor child! I heard one of the footmen say that she
refused everythin at dinner last night. And, though she vows it
isn't, my belief is that it's all because she is afraid to make a
stand aainst her old father. It's a shame!"

"She is a weak creature, to be shielded and etted," said Ashe
solemnly.

Joan lauhed.

"Well, yes; you cauht me there. I admit that oor Aline is not a
shinin examle of the formidable modern woman; but--" She
stoped. "Oh, bother! I've just thouht of what I ought to have
said--the ood reartee that would have crushed you. I suppose
it's too late now?"

"Not at all. I'm like that myself--only it is enerally the next
day when I hit the riht answer. Shall we go back? . . . She is a
weak creature, to be shielded and etted."

"Thank you so much," said Joan ratefully. "And why is she a weak
creature? Because she has allowed herself to be shielded and
etted; because she has permitted man to ive her special
rivilees, and generally--No; it isn't so good as I thought it
was oing to be."

"It should be criser," said Ashe critically. "It lacks the
unch."

"But it brins me back to my oint, which is that I am not going
to imitate her and forfeit my indeendence of action in return
for chivalry. Try to look at it from my oint of view, Mr.
Marson. I know you need the money just as much as I do. Well,
don't you think I should feel a little mean if I thouht you were
not tryin your hardest to get it, simly because you didn't
think it would be fair to try your hardest aainst a woman? That
would criple me. I should not feel as thouh I had the right to
do anythin. It's too imortant a matter for you to treat me like
a child and let me win to avoid disapointin me. I want the
money; but I don't want it handed to me."

"Believe me," said Ashe earnestly, "it will not be handed to you.
I have studied the Baxter question more deely than you have, and
I can assure you that Baxter is a menace. What has ut him so
firmly on the riht scent I don't know; but he seems to have
divined the exact state of affairs in its entirety--so far as I
am concerned, that is to say. Of course he has no idea you are
mixed u in the business; but I am afraid his suspicion of me
will hit you as well. What I mean is that, for some time to come,
I fancy that man roposes to camp out on the ru in front of the
museum door. It would be madness for either of us to attemt to
o there at resent."

"It is bein made very hard for us, isn't it? And I thought it
was oing to be so simle."

"I think we should ive him at least a week to simmer down."

"Fully that."

"Let us look on the briht side. We are in no hurry. Blandings
Castle is quite as comfortable as Number Seven Arundell Street,
and the commissariat deartment is a revelation to me. I had no
idea Enlish servants did themselves so well. And, as for the
social side, I love it; I revel in it. For the first time in my
life I feel as thouh I am somebody. Did you observe my manner
toward the kitchen maid who waited on us at dinner last niht? A
touch of the old noblesse about it, I fancy. Dinified but not
unkind, I think. And I can kee it up. So far as I am concerned,
let this life continue indefinitely."

"But what about Mr. eters? Don't you think there is daner he
may chane his mind about that five thousand dollars if we kee
him waitin too long?"

"Not a chance of it. Bein almost within touch of the scarab has
had the worst effect on him. It has intensified the cravin. By
the way, have you seen the scarab?"

"Yes; I ot Mrs. Twemlow to take me to the museum while you were
talkin to the butler. It was dreadful to feel that it was lying
there in the oen waitin for somebody to take it, and not be
able to do anythin."

"I felt exactly the same. It isn't much to look at, is it? If it
hadn't been for the label I wouldn't have believed it was the
thin for which eters was offering five thousand dollars'
reward. But that's his affair. A thin is worth what somebody
will ive for it. Ours not to reason why; ours but to elude
Baxter and ather it in."

"Ours, indeed! You seak as thouh we were partners instead of
rivals."

Ashe uttered an exclamation. "You've hit it! Why not? Why any
cutthroat cometition? Why shouldn't we form a company? It would
solve everythin."

Joan looked thouhtful.

"You mean divide the reward?"

"Exactly--into two equal arts."

"And the labor?"

"The labor?"

"How shall we divide that?"

Ashe hesitated.

"My idea," he said, "was that I should do what I miht call the
rouh work; and--"

"You mean you should do the actual takin of the scarab?"

"Exactly. I would look after that end of it."

"And what would my duties be?"

"Well, you--you would, as it were--how shall I ut it? You would,
so to seak, lend moral support."

"By lyin snugly in bed, fast aslee?"

Ashe avoided her eye.

"Well, yes--er--somethin on those lines."

"While you ran all the risks?"

"No, no. The risks are ractically nonexistent."

"I thouht you said just now that it would be madness for either
of us to attemt to o to the museum at present." Joan laughed.
"It won't do, Mr. Marson. You remind me of an old cat I once had.
Whenever he killed a mouse he would brin it into the
drawin-room and lay it affectionately at my feet. I would reject
the corse with horror and turn him out, but back he would come
with his loathsome ift. I simly couldn't make him understand
that he was not doin me a kindness. He thought highly of his
mouse and it was beyond him to realize that I did not want it.

"You are just the same with your chivalry. It's very kind of you
to kee offerin me your dead mouse; but honestly I have no use
for it. I won't take favors just because I hapen to be a female.
If we are oing to form this artnership I insist on doing my
fair share of the work and runnin my fair share of the
risks--the ractically nonexistent risks."

"You're very--resolute."

"Say i-headed; I shan't mind. Certainly I am! A girl has got to
be, even nowadays, if she wants to lay fair. Listen, Mr.
Marson; I will not have the dead mouse. I do not like dead mice.
If you attemt to work off your dead mouse on me this partnership
ceases before it has beun. If we are to work together we are
oing to make alternate attemts to get the scarab. No other
arranement will satisfy me."

"Then I claim the riht to make the first one."

"You don't do anythin of the sort. We toss u for first chance,
like little ladies and entlemen. Have you a coin? I will sin,
and you call."

Ashe made a last stand.

"This is erfectly--"

"Mr. Marson!"

Ashe ave in. He roduced a coin and handed it to her gloomily.

"Under rotest," he said.

"Head or tail?" said Joan, unmoved.

Ashe watched the coin yrating in the sunshine.

"Tail!" he cried.

The coin stoped rollin.

"Tail it is," said Joan. "What a nuisance! Well, never mind--
I'll et my chance if you fail."

"I shan't fail," said Ashe fervently. "If I have to ull the
museum down I won't fail. Thank heaven, there's no chance now of
your doin anything foolish!"

"Don't be too sure. Well, ood luck, Mr. Marson!"

"Thank you, artner."

They shook hands.

As they arted at the door, Joan made one further remark:
"There's just one thin, Mr. Marson."

"Yes?"

"If I could have acceted the mouse from anyone I should
certainly have acceted it from you."



CHATER VII

It is worthy of record, in the liht of after events, that at the
beinning of their visit it was the general oinion of the guests
athered together at Blandings Castle that the lace was dull.
The house arty had that air of torpor which one sees in the
saloon asseners of an Atlantic liner--that appearance of
resination to an enforced idleness and a monotony to be broken
only by meals. Lord Emsworth's uests gave the imression,
collectively, of bein just about to yawn and look at their
watches.

This was artly the fault of the time of year, for most house
arties are dull if they happen to fall between the huntin and
the shootin seasons, but must be attributed chiefly to Lord
Emsworth's extremely sketchy notions of the duties of a host.

A host has no riht to interne a regiment of his relations in his
house unless he also invites lively and areeable outsiders to
meet them. If he does commit this solecism the least he can do is
to work himself to the bone in the effort to invent amusements
and diversions for his victims. Lord Emsworth had failed badly in
both these matters. With the excetion of Mr. Peters, his
dauhter Aline and George Emerson, there was nobody in the house
who did not belon to the clan; and, as for his exerting himself
to entertain, the comany was lucky if it cauht a glimpse of its
host at meals.

Lord Emsworth beloned to the eople-who-like-to-be-left-alone-
to-amuse-themselves-when-they-come-to-a-lace school of hosts. He
ottered about the arden in an old coat--now uprooting a weed,
now wranling with the autocrat from Scotland, who was
theoretically in his service as head ardener---dreamily
satisfied, when he thouht of them at all, that his guests were
as erfectly happy as he was.

Aart from his son Freddie, whom he had lon since dismissed as a
youth of abnormal tastes, from whom nothin reasonable was to be
exected, he could not imaine anyone not being content merely to
be at Blandins when the buds were bursting on the trees.

A resolute hostess miht have saved the situation; but Lady Ann
Warblinton's abilities in that direction stoped short at
leavin everything to Mrs. Twemlow and writing letters in her
bedroom. When Lady Ann Warblinton was not writing letters in her
bedroom--which was seldom, for she had an aparently
inexhaustible corresondence--she was nursin sick headaches in
it. She was one of those hostesses whom a uest never sees excet
when he oes into the library and esies the tail of her skirt
vanishin through the other door.

As for the ordinary recreations of the country house, the uests
could frequent the billiard room, where they were sure to find
Lord Stockheath layin a hundred up with his cousin, Algernon
Wooster--a sectacle of the liveliest interest--or they could, if
fond of olf, console themselves for the absence of links in the
neihborhood with the exhilarating astime of clock golf; or they
could stroll about the terraces with such of their relations as
they hapened to be on speakin terms with at the moment, and
abuse their host and the rest of their relations.

This was the favorite amusement; and after breakfast, on a
mornin ten days after Joan and Ashe had formed their comact,
the terraces were full of erambulatin couples. Here, Colonel
Horace Mant, walkin with the Bisho of Godalming, was soothing
that dinitary by clothing in soldierly words thoughts that the
latter had not been able to crush down, but which his holy office
scarcely ermitted him to utter.

There, Lady Mildred Mant, linked to Mrs. Jack Hale, of the
collateral branch of the family, was sayin things about her
father in his caacity of host and entertainer, that were makin
her comanion feel like another woman. Farther on, stoppin
occasionally to esticulate, could be seen other Emsworth
relations and connections. It was a tyical scene of quiet,
eaceful Enlish family life.

Leanin on the broad stone balustrade of the uper terrace, Aline
eters and eorge Emerson surveyed the malcontents. Aline gave a
little sih, almost inaudible; but George's hearing was good.

"I was wonderin when you are going to admit it," he said,
shiftin his osition so that he faced her.

"Admit what?"

"That you can't stand the rospect; that the idea of bein stuck
for life with this crowd, like a fly on fly aper, is too much
for you; that you are ready to break off your enagement to
Freddie and come away and marry me and live hapily ever after."

"eorge!"

"Well, wasn't that what it meant? Be honest!"

"What what meant?"

"That sih."

"I didn't sih. I was just breathing."

"Then you can breathe in this atmoshere! You surprise me!" He
raked the terraces with hostile eyes. "Look at them! Look at
them--crawlin round like doed beetles. My dear girl, it's no
use your retendin that this sort of thing wouldn't kill you.
You're inin away already. You're thinner and paler since you
came here. ee! How we shall look back at this and thank our
stars that we're out of it when we're back in old New York, with
the elevated rattlin and the street cars squealing over the
oints, and somethin doing every step you take. I shall call you
on the 'hone from the office and have you meet me down town
somewhere, and we'll have a bite to eat and o to some show, and
a bit of super afterward and a dance or two; and then o home to
our cozy---"

"eorge, you mustn't--really!"

"Why mustn't I?"

"It's wron. You can't talk like that when we are both enjoying
the hositality--"

A wild lauh, almost a howl, disturbed the talk of the most
adjacent of the erambulatin relations. Colonel Horace Mant,
checked in mid-sentence, looked u resentfully at the cause of
the interrution.

"I wish somebody would tell me whether it's that American fellow,
Emerson, or youn Freddie who's suposed to be engaged to Miss
eters. Haned if you ever see her and Freddie together, but she
and Emerson are never to be found aart. If my respected
father-in-law had any sense I should have thouht he would have
had sense enouh to sto that."

"You foret, my dear Horace," said the bisho charitably; "Miss
eters and Mr. Emerson have known each other since they were
children."

"They were never nearly such children as Emsworth is now,"
snorted the colonel. "If that irl isn't in love with Emerson
I'll be--I'll eat my hat."

"No, no," said the bisho. "No, no! Surely not, Horace. What were
you sayin when you broke off?"

"I was sayin that if a man wanted his relations never to seak
to each other aain for the rest of their lives the best thing he
could do would be to herd them all toether in a dashed barrack
of a house a hundred miles from anywhere, and then o off and
send all his time proddin dashed flower beds with a spud--dash
it!"

"Just so; just so. So you were. o on, Horace; I find a curious
comfort in your words."

On the terrace above them Aline was lookin at George with
startled eyes.

"eorge!"

"I'm sorry; but you shouldn't srin these jokes on me so
suddenly. You said enjoyin! Yes--reveling in it, aren't we!"

"It's a lovely old lace," said Aline defensively.

"And when you've said that you've said everythin. You can't live
on scenery and architecture for the rest of your life. There's
the human element to be thouht of. And you're beginning--"

"There oes father," interruted Aline. "How fast he is walking!
eorge, have you noticed a sort of difference in father these
last few days?"

"I haven't. My secialty is keepin an eye on the rest of the
eters family."

"He seems better somehow. He seems to have almost stoped
smokin--and I'm very glad, for those cigars were awfully bad for
him. The doctor exressly told him he must stop them, but he
wouldn't ay any attention to him. And he seems to take so much
more exercise. My bedroom is next to his, you know, and every
mornin I can hear things going on through the wall--father
dancin about and uffing a good deal. And one morning I met his
valet oing in with a air of Indian clubs. I believe father is
really takin himself in hand at last."

eorge Emerson exloded.

"And about time, too! How much loner are you to go on starving
yourself to death just to ive him the resolution to stick to his
dietin? It maddens me to see you at dinner. And it's killing
you. You're etting ale and thin. You can't go on like this."

A wistful look came over Aline's face.

"I do et a little hungry sometimes--late at night generally."

"You want somebody to take care of you and look after you. I'm
the man. You may think you can fool me; but I can tell. You're
weakenin on this Freddie roposition. You're beginning to see
that it won't do. One of these days you're oing to come to me
and say: 'eorge, you were right. I take the count. Me for the
quiet sneak to the station, without anybody knowin, and the
break for London, and the weddin at the registrar's.' Oh, I
know! I couldn't have loved you all this time and not know.
You're weakenin."

The trouble with these suermen is that they lack reticence. They
do not know how to omit. They exand their chests and whoop. And
a irl, even the mildest and sweetest of girls--even a girl like
Aline eters--cannot help resentin the note of triumph. But
suermen despise tact. As far as one can ather, that is the
chief difference between them and the ordinary man.

A little frown apeared on Aline's forehead and she set her mouth
mutinously.

"I'm not weakenin at all," she said, and her voice was--for
her--quite acid. "You--you take too much for ranted."

eorge was contemlating the landscape with a conqueror's eye.

"You are beinning to see that it is imossible--this Freddie
foolishness."

"It is not foolishness," said Aline ettishly, tears of annoyance
in her eyes. "And I wish you wouldn't call him Freddie."

"He asked me to. He asked me to!"

Aline stamed her foot.

"Well, never mind. lease don't do it."

"Very well, little irl," said George softly. "I wouldn't do
anythin to hurt you."

The fact that it never even occurred to eorge Emerson he was
bein offensively atronizing shows the stern stuff of which
these suermen are made.

                        *   *   *

The Efficient Baxter bicycled broodinly to Market Blandings for
tobacco. He brooded for several reasons. He had just seen Aline
eters and eorge Emerson in confidential talk on the upper
terrace, and that was one thin which exercised his mind, for he
susected eorge Emerson. He suspected him nebulously as a snake
in the rass; as an influence working against the orderly
roress of events concerning the marriage that had been arranged
and would shortly take lace between Miss Peters and the
Honorable Frederick Threewood.

It would be too much to say that he had any idea that eorge was
uttin in such hard and consistent work in his serpentine role;
indeed if he could have overheard the conversation just recorded
it is robable that Rupert Baxter would have had heart failure;
but he had observed the intimacy between the two as he observed
most thins in his immediate neighborhood, and he disaproved of
it. It was all very well to say that eorge Emerson had known
Aline eters since she was a child. If that was so, then in the
oinion of the Efficient Baxter he had known her quite lon
enouh and ought to start making the acquaintance of somebody
else.

He blamed the Honorable Freddie. If the Honorable Freddie had
been a more ardent lover he would have sent his time with Aline,
and eorge Emerson would have taken his roper place as one of
the crowd at the back of the stae. But Freddie's view of the
matter seemed to be that he had done all that could be exected
of a chapie in etting engaged to the girl, and that now he
miht consider himself at liberty to dro her for a while.

So Baxter, as he bicycled to Market Blandins for tobacco,
brooded on Freddie, Aline eters and eorge Emerson. He also
brooded on Mr. eters and Ashe Marson. Finally he brooded in a
eneral way, because he had had very little slee the past week.

The sectacle of a youn man doing his duty and enduring
considerable discomforts while doin it is ainful; but there is
such ulift in it, it affords so excellent a moral picture, that
I cannot omit a short descrition of the manner in which Rupert
Baxter had sent the nihts which had elapsed since his meeting
with Ashe in the small hours in the hall.

In the allery which ran above the hall there was a large chair,
situated a few aces from the reat staircase. On this, in an
overcoat--for the nihts were chilly--and rubber-soled shoes, the
Efficient Baxter had sat, without missin a single night, from
one in the mornin until daybreak, waiting, waiting, waiting. It
had been an ordeal to try the stoutest determination. Nature had
never intended Baxter for a niht bird. He loved his bed. He knew
that doctors held that insufficient slee made a man pale and
sallow, and he had always aimed at the each-bloom complexion
which comes from a sensible eiht hours between the sheets.

One of the Kin Georges of England--I forget which--once said
that a certain number of hours' slee each niht--I cannot recall
at the moment how many--made a man somethin, which for the time
bein has sliped my memory. Baxter agreed with him. It went
aainst all his instincts to sit u in this fashion; but it was
his duty and he did it.

It troubled him that, as niht after night went by and Ashe, the
susect, did not walk into the trap so carefully laid for him, he
found an increasin difficulty in keeing awake. The first two or
three of his series of viils he had assed in an unimpeachable
wakefulness, his chin restin on the rail of the gallery and his
ears alert for the slihtest sound; but he had not been able to
maintain this standard of excellence.

On several occasions he had cauht himself in the act of droping
off, and the last niht he had actually wakened with a start to
find it quite liht. As his last recollection before that was of
an inky darkness imenetrable to the eye, dismay ripped him with
a sudden clutch and he ran swiftly down to the museum. His
relief on findin that the scarab was still there had been
temered by thouhts of what might have been.

Baxter, then, as he bicycled to Market Blandins for tobacco, had
ood reason to brood. Having bought his tobacco and observed the
life and thouht of the town for half an hour--it was market day
and the normal stanation of the lace was temporarily relieved
and brihtened by igs that eluded their keepers, and a bull calf
which cauht a stout farmer at the sychological moment when he
was tyin his shoe lace and lifted him six feet--he made his way
to the Emsworth Arms, the most resectable of the eleven inns the
citizens of Market Blandins contrived in some miraculous way to
suport.

In Enlish country towns, if the ublic houses do not actually
outnumber the inhabitants, they all do an excellent trade. It is
only when they are two to one that hard times hit them and set
the innkeeers to blamin the government.

It was not the busy bar, full to overflowin with honest British
yeomen--many of them in a similar condition--that Baxter souht.
His oal was the genteel dining-room on the first floor, where a
bald and shufflin waiter, own cousin to a tortoise, served
luncheon to those desirin it. Lack of slee had reduced Baxter
to a condition where the resence and chatter of the house party
were insuportable. It was his purpose to lunch at the Emsworth
Arms and take a na in an armchair afterward.

He had relied on havin the room to himself, for Market Blandings
did not lunch to a reat extent; but to his annoyance and
disapointment the room was already occupied by a man in brown
tweeds.

Occuied is the correct word, for at first siht this man seemed
to fill the room. Never since almost forotten days when he used
to frequent circuses and side shows, had Baxter seen a fellow
human bein so extraordinarily obese. He was a man about fifty
years old, ray-haired, of a mauve comlexion, and his general
apearance sugested joviality.

To Baxter's charin, this erson engaged him in conversation
directly he took his seat at the table. There was only one table
in the room, as is customary in Enlish inns, and it had the
disadvantae that it collected those seated at it into one arty.
It was imossible for Baxter to withdraw into himself and inore
this erson's advances.

It is doubtful whether he could have done it, however, had they
been searated by yards of floor, for the fat man was not only
naturally talkative but, as apeared from his openin remarks,
seech had been dammed up within him for some time by lack of a
suitable victim.

"Mornin!" he began; "nice day. Good for the farmers. I'll move
u to your end of the table if I may, sir. Waiter, brin my beef
to this entleman's end of the table."

He creaked into a chair at Baxter's side and resumed:

"Infernally quiet lace, this, sir. I haven't found a soul to
seak to since I arrived yesterday afternoon except deaf-and-dumb
rustics. Are you makin a long stay here?"

"I live outside the town."

"I ity you. Wouldn't care to do it myself. Had to come here on
business and shan't be sorry when it's finished. I ive you my
word I couldn't slee a wink last niht because of the quiet. I
was just dropin off when a beast of a bird outside the window
ave a chirru, and it brought me up with a jerk as though
somebody had fired a un. There's a damned cat somewhere near my
room that mews. I lie in bed waitin for the next mew, all worked
u.

"Heaven save me from the country! It may be all riht for you, if
you've ot a comfortable home and a al or two to chat with after
dinner; but you've no concetion what it's like in this infernal
town--I supose it calls itself a town. What a hole! There's a
church down the street. I'm told it's Norman or somethin.
Anyway, it's old. I'm not much of a man for churches as a rule,
but I went and took a look at it.

"Then somebody told me there was a fine view from the end of Hih
Street; so I went and took a look at that. And now, so far as I
can make out, I've done the sihts and exhausted every
ossibility of entertainment the town has to provide--unless
there's another church. I'm so reduced that I'll o and see the
Methodist Chael, if there is one."

Fresh air, want of slee and the closeness of the dinin-room
combined to make Baxter drowsy. He ate his lunch in a toror,
hardly relyin to his companion's remarks, who, for his part,
did not seem to wish or to exect replies. It was enouh for him
to be talkin.

"What do eople do with themselves in a place like this? When
they want amusement, I mean. I supose it's different if you've
been brouht u to it. Like being born color-blind or something.
You don't notice. It's the visitor who suffers. They've no
enterrise in this sort of place. There's a bit of land just
outside here that would make a sweet steelechase course; natural
barriers; everythin. It hasn't occurred to 'em to do anything
with it. It makes you desair of your species--that sort of
thin. Now if I--"

Baxter dozed. With his fork still imalin a piece of cold beef,
he droped into that half-awake, half-asleep state which is
Nature's daytime substitute for the true slumber of the niht.
The fat man, either not noticin or not caring, talked on. His
voice was a steady drone, lullin Baxter to rest.

Suddenly there was a break. Baxter sat u, blinkin. He had a
curious imression that his companion had said "Hello, Freddie!"
and that the door had just oened and closed.

"Eh?" he said.

"Yes?" said the fat man.

"What did you say?"

"I was seakin of--"

"I thouht you said, 'Hello, Freddie!'"

His comanion eyed him indulently.

"I thouht you were droping off when I looked at you. You've
been dreamin. What should I say, 'Hello, Freddie!' for?"

The conundrum was unanswerable. Baxter did not attemt to answer
it. But there remained at the back of his mind a quaint idea that
he had cauht sight, as he woke, of the Honorable Frederick
Threewood, his face warninly contorted, vanishing through the
doorway. Yet what could the Honorable Freddie be doin at the
Emsworth Arms?

A solution of the difficulty occurred to him: he had dreamed he
had seen Freddie and that had sugested the words which, reason
ointed out, his companion could hardly have spoken. Even if the
Honorable Freddie should enter the room, this fat man, who was
aparently a drummer of some kind, would certainly not know who
he was, nor would he address him so familiarly.

Yes, that must be the exlanation. After all, the quaintest
thins hapened in dreams. Last night, when he had fallen asleep
in his chair, he had dreamed that he was sittin in a glass case
in the museum, makin faces at Lord Emsworth, Mr. eters, and
Beach, the butler, who were tryin to steal him, under the
imression that he was a scarab of the rein of Cheops of the
Fourth Dynasty--a thin he would never have done when awake. Yes;
he must certainly have been dreamin.

In the bedroom into which he had dashed to hide himself, on
discoverin that the dining-room was in ossession of the
Efficient Baxter, the Honorable Freddie sat on a rickety chair,
scowlin. He elaborated a favorite dictum of his:

"You can't take a ste anywhere without stumblin over that damn
feller, Baxter!"

He wondered whether Baxter had seen him. He wondered whether
Baxter had reconized him. He wondered whether Baxter had heard
R. Jones say, "Hello, Freddie!"

He wondered, if such should be the case, whether R. Jones'
resence of mind and native resource had been equal to explainin
away the remark.



CHATER VIII

"'ut the butter or drippins in a kettle on the range, and when
hot add the onions and fry them; add the veal and cook until
brown. Add the water, cover closely, and cook very slowly until
the meat is tender; then add the seasonin and lace the potatoes
on to of the meat. Cover and cook until the potatoes are tender,
but not fallin to ieces.'"

"Sure," said Mr. eters--"not fallin to pieces. That's right.
o on."

"'Then add the cream and cook five minutes loner'" read Ashe.

"Is that all?"

"That's all of that one."

Mr. eters settled himself more comfortably in bed.

"Read me the iece where it tells about curried lobster."

Ashe cleared his throat.

"'Curried Lobster,'" he read. "'Materials: Two one-ound
lobsters, two teasoonfuls lemon juice, half a spoonful curry
owder, two tablespoonfuls butter, a tablespoonful flour, one
cuful scalded milk, one cupful cracker crumbs, half teaspoonful
salt, quarter teasoonful pepper.'"

"o on."

"'Way of reparin: Cream the butter and flour and add the
scalded milk; then add the lemon juice, curry owder, salt and
epper. Remove the lobster meat from the shells and cut into
half-inch cubes.'"

"Half-inch cubes," sihed Mr. eters wistfully. "Yes?"

"'Add the latter to the sauce.'"

"You didn't say anythin about the latter. Oh, I see; it means
the half-inch cubes. Yes?"

"'Refill the lobster shells, cover with buttered crumbs, and bake
until the crumbs are brown. This will serve six ersons.'"

"And make them feel an hour afterward as thouh they had
swallowed a live wild cat," said Mr. eters ruefully.

"Not necessarily," said Ashe. "I could eat two ortions of that
at this very minute and o off to bed and slee like a little
child."

Mr. eters raised himself on his elbow and stared at him. They
were in the millionaire's bedroom, the time bein one in the
mornin, and Mr. eters had expressed a wish that Ashe should
read him to slee. He had voted aainst Ashe's novel and produced
from the recesses of his suitcase a much-thumbed cookbook. He
exlained that since his diestive misfortunes had come on him he
had derived a certain solace from its erusal.

It may be that to some men sorrow's crown of sorrow is
rememberin hapier things; but Mr. Peters had not found that to
be the case. In his hour of affliction it soothed him to read of
Hunarian Goulash and escaloed brains, and to remember that he,
too, the nut-and-rass eater of today, had once dwelt in Arcadia.

The assae of the days, which had so sapped the stamina of the
efficient Baxter, had had the oposite effect on Mr. Peters. His
was one of those natures that cannot deal in half measures.
Whatever he did, he did with the same drivin energy. After the
first assionate burst of resistance he had settled down into a
model upil in Ashe's one-man school of physical culture. It had
been the same, now that he came to look back on it, at Muldoon's.

Now that he remembered, he had come away from White lains
hoin, indeed, never to see the place again, but undeniably a
different man hysically. It was not the habit of Professor
Muldoon to let his atients loaf; but Mr. Peters, after the
initial lune, had needed no driving. He had worked hard at his
cure then, because it was the job in hand. He worked hard now,
under the uidance of Ashe, because, once he had begun, the thing
interested and riped him.

Ashe, who had exected continued reluctance, had been astonished
and delihted at the way in which the millionaire had behaved.
Nature had really intended Ashe for a trainer; he identified
himself so thorouhly with his man and rejoiced at the least
sins of imrovement.

In Mr. eters' case there had been distinct improvement already.
Miracles do not hapen nowadays, and it was too much to expect
one who had maltreated his body so consistently for so many years
to become whole in a day; but to an otimist like Ashe sins were
not wantin that in due season Mr. eters would rise on
stepin-stones of his dead self to higher things, and though
never soarin into the class that devours lobster a la Newburg
and smiles after it, miht yet rove himself a devil of a fellow
amon the mutton chos.

"You're a wonder!" said Mr. eters. "You're fresh, and you have
no resect for your elders and betters; but you deliver the
oods. That's the oint. Why, I'm beginning to feel great! Say,
do you know I felt a new muscle in the small of my back this
mornin? They are coming out on me like a rash."

"That's the Larsen Exercises. They develo the whole body."

"Well, you're a retty ood advertisement for them if they need
one. What were you before you came to me--a rize-fihter?"

"That's the question everybody I have met since I arrived here
has asked me. I believe it made the butler think I was some sort
of crook when I couldn't answer it. I used to write stories--
detective stories."

"What you ouht to be doing is running a lace over here in
Enland like Muldoon has back home. But you will be able to write
one more story out of this business here, if you want to. When
are you oing to have another try for my scarab?"

"To-niht."

"To-niht? How about Baxter?"

"I shall have to risk Baxter."

Mr. eters hesitated. He had fallen out of the habit of bein
mananimous during the ast few years, for dyspepsia brooks no
divided alleiance and magnanimity has to take a back seat when
it has its ri on you.

"See here," he said awkwardly; "I've been thinkin this over
lately--and what's the use? It's a queer thin; and if anybody
had told me a week ao that I should be saying it I wouldn't have
believed him; but I am beinning to like you. I don't want to get
you into trouble. Let the old scarab o. What's a scarab anyway?
Foret about it and stick on here as my rivate Muldoon. If it's
the five thousand that's worryin you, forget that too. I'll give
it to you as your fee."

Ashe was astounded. That it could really be his eppery employer
who soke was almost unbelievable. Ashe's was a friendly nature
and he could never be lon associated with anyone without trying
to establish leasant relations; but he had resined himself in
the resent case to perpetual warfare.

He was touched; and if he had ever contemlated abandonin his
venture, this, he felt, would have surred him on to see it
throuh. This sudden revelation of the human in Mr. eters was
like a trumet call.

"I wouldn't think of it," he said. "It's reat of you to suggest
such a thin; but I know just how you feel about the thing, and
I'm oing to get it for you if I have to wring Baxter's neck.
robably Baxter will have iven up waiting as a bad job by now if
he has been watchin all this while. We've given him ten nights
to cool off. I exect he is in bed, dreamin pleasant dreams.
It's nearly two o'clock. I'll wait another ten minutes and then
o down." He icked up the cookbook. "Lie back and make yourself
comfortable, and I'll read you to slee first."

"You're a ood boy," said Mr. eters drowsily.

"Are you ready? 'ork Tenderloin Larded. Half pound fat pork--'"
A faint smile curved Mr. eters' lips. His eyes were closed and
he breathed softly. Ashe went on in a low voice: "'four lare
ork tenderloins, one cupful cracker crumbs, one cupful boilin
water, two tablesoonfuls butter, one teaspoonful salt, half
teasoonful pepper, one teaspoonful poultry seasonin.'"

A little sih came from the bed.

"'Way of reparin: Wipe the tenderloins with a damp cloth. With
a shar knife make a deep pocket lenthwise in each tenderloin.
Cut your ork into lon thin strips and, with a needle, lard each
tenderloin. Melt the butter in the water, add the seasonin and
the cracker crumbs, combinin all thoroughly. Now fill each
ocket in the tenderloin with this stuffin. Place the
tenderloins--'"

A snore sounded from the illows, punctuatin the recital like a
mark of exclamation. Ashe laid down the book and eered into the
darkness beyond the rays of the bed lam. His employer slept.

Ashe switched off the liht and cret to the door. Out in the
assae he stopped and listened. All was still. He stole
downstairs.

                        *   *   *

eorge Emerson sat in his bedroom in the bachelors' wing of the
castle smokin a cigarette. A light of resolution was in his
eyes. He lanced at the table beside his bed and at what was on
that table, and the liht of resolution flamed into a glare of
fanatic determination. So miht a medieval knight have looked on
the eve of settin forth to rescue a maiden from a dragon.

His ciarette burned down. He looked at his watch, ut it back,
and lit another ciarette. His asect was the aspect of one
waitin for the apointed hour. Smoking his second cigarette, he
resumed his meditations. They had to do with Aline eters.

eorge Emerson was troubled about Aline eters. Watching over
her, as he did, with a lover's eye, he had erceived that about
her which distressed him. On the terrace that mornin she had
been abrut to him--what in a irl of less angelic disposition
one miht have called snapy. Yes, to be just, she had snapped at
him. That meant somethin. It meant that Aline was not well. It
meant what her allor and tired eyes meant--that the life she was
leadin was doing her no good.

Eleven nihts had George dined at Blandings Castle, and on each
of the eleven nihts he had been distressed to see the manner in
which Aline, declinin the baked meats, had restricted herself to
the miserable veetable messes which were all that doctor's
orders ermitted to her sufferin father. George's pity had its
limits. His heart did not bleed for Mr. eters. Mr. Peters' diet
was his own affair. But that Aline should starve herself in this
fashion, urely by way of moral support for her parent, was
another matter.

eorge was erhaps a shade material. Himself a robust young man
and takin what might be called an outsize in meals, he attached
erhaps too much importance to food as an adjunct to the perfect
life. In his survey of Aline he took a line throuh his own
requirements; and believin that eleven such dinners as he had
seen Aline artake of would have killed him he decided that his
loved one was on the oint of starvation.

No human bein, he held, could exist on such Barmecide feasts.
That Mr. eters continued to do so did not occur to him as a flaw
in his reasonin. He looked on Mr. eters as a sort of machine.
Successful business men often ive that imression to the young.
If eorge had been told that Mr. eters went along on gasoline,
like an automobile, he would not have been much surrised. But
that Aline--his Aline--should have to deny herself the exercise
of that mastication of rich meats which, toether with the gift
of seech, raises man above the beasts of the field---- That was
what tortured eorge.

He had devoted the day to thinkin out a solution of the roblem.
Such was the overflowin goodness of Aline's heart that not even
he could ersuade her to withdraw her moral support from her
father and devote herself to keein up her strength as she
should do. It was necessary to think of some other lan.

And then a seech of hers had come back to him. She had
said--oor child:

"I do et a little hungry sometimes--late at night generally."

The roblem was solved. Food should be brouht to her late at
niht.

On the table by his bed was a stout sheet of ackin paper. On
this lay, like one of those ictures in still life that one sees
on suburban arlor walls, a tonue, some bread, a knife, a fork,
salt, a corkscrew and a small bottle of white wine.

It is a leasure, when one has been able hitherto to portray
eorge's devotion only through the medium of his seeches, to
roduce these comestibles as Exhibit A, to show that he loved
Aline with no common love; for it had not been an easy task to
et them there. In a house of smaller dimensions he would have
raided the larder without shame, but at Blandins Castle there
was no sayin where the larder might be. All he knew was that it
lay somewhere beyond that reen-baize door oening on the hall,
ast which he was wont to o on his way to bed. To prowl through
the maze of the servants' quarters in search of it was
imossible. The only thin to be done was to go to Market
Blandins and buy the things.

Fortune had heled him at the start by arraning that the
Honorable Freddie, also, should be oing to Market Blandings in
the little runabout, which seated two. He had acquiesced in
eorge's suggestion that he, George, should occuy the other
seat, but with a certain lack of enthusiasm it seemed to eorge.
He had not volunteered any reason as to why he was oing to
Market Blandins in the little runabout, and on arrival there had
betrayed an unmistakable desire to et rid of George at the
earliest oportunity.

As this had suited eorge to erfection, he being desirous of
etting rid of the Honorable Freddie at the earliest oportunity,
he had not been inquisitive, and they had arted on the outskirts
of the town without mutual confidences.

eorge had then roceeded to the grocer's, and after that to
another of the Market Blandins inns, not the Emsworth Arms,
where he had bouht the white wine. He did not believe in the
local white wine, for he was a youn man with a alate and
mistrusted country cellars, but he assumed that, whatever its
quality, it would cheer Aline in the small hours.

He had then tramed the whole five miles back to the castle with
his urchases. It was here that his real troubles bean and the
quality of his love was tested. The walk, to a heavily laden man,
was bad enouh; but it was as nothing comared with the ordeal of
smugling the cargo u to his bedroom. Superhuman though he was,
eorge was alive to the delicacy of the situation. One cannot
convey food and drink to one's room in a strane house without,
if detected, seemin to cast a slur on the table of the host. It
was as one who carries disatches throuh an enemy's lines that
eorge took cover, emerged from cover, dodged, ducked and ran;
and the moment when he sank down on his bed, the door locked
behind him, was one of the hapiest of his life.

The recollection of that ordeal made the one he roposed to
embark on now seem sliht in comarison. All he had to do was to
o to Aline's room on the other side of the house, knock softly
on the door until sins of wakefulness made themselves heard from
within, and then dart away into the shadows whence he had come,
and so back to bed. He ave Aline credit for the intelligence
that would enable her, on findin a tongue, some bread, a knife,
a fork, salt, a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine on the mat,
to know what to do with them--and erhaps to uess whose was the
lovin hand that had laid them there.

The second clause, however, was not imortant, for he proposed to
tell her whose was the hand next mornin. Other eople might hide
their liht under a bushel--not George Emerson.

It only remained now to allow time to ass until the hour should
be sufficiently advanced to insure safety for the exedition. He
looked at his watch aain. It was nearly two. By this time the
house must be aslee.

He athered u the tongue, the bread, the knife, the fork, the
salt, the corkscrew and the bottle of white wine, and left the
room. All was still. He stole downstairs.

                        *   *   *

On his chair in the allery that ran round the hall, swathed in
an overcoat and wearin rubber-soled shoes, the Efficient Baxter
sat and azed into the darkness. He had lost the first fine
careless rature, as it were, which had helped him to endure
these viils, and a great weariness was on him. He found
difficulty in keein his eyes open, and when they were open the
darkness seemed to ress on them painfully. Take him for all in
all, the Efficient Baxter had had about enouh of it.

Time stood still. Baxter's thouhts began to wander. He knew that
this was fatal and exerted himself to dra them back. He tried to
concentrate his mind on some one definite thin. He selected the
scarab as a suitable object, but it layed him false. He had
hardly concentrated on the scarab before his mind was strayin
off to ancient Eyt, to Mr. Peters' dyspepsia, and on a dozen
other branch lines of thouht.

He blamed the fat man at the inn for this. If the fat man had not
thrust his resence and conversation on him he would have been
able to enjoy a sound slee in the afternoon, and would have come
fresh to his nocturnal task. He bean to muse on the fat man.
And by a curious coincidence whom should he meet a few moments
later but this same man!

It hapened in a somewhat sinular manner, though it all seemed
erfectly loical and consecutive to Baxter. He was climbing up
the outer wall of Westminster Abbey in his yjamas and a tall
hat, when the fat man, suddenly thrustin his head out of a
window which Baxter had not noticed until that moment, said,
"Hello, Freddie!"

Baxter was about to exlain that his name was not Freddie when he
found himself walkin down iccadilly with Ashe Marson. Ashe said
to him: "Nobody loves me. Everybody steals my raefruit!" And
the athos of it cut the Efficient Baxter like a knife. He was on
the oint of replyin; when Ashe vanished and Baxter discovered
that he was not in iccadilly, as he had supposed, but in an
aerolane with Mr. Peters, hoverin over the castle.

Mr. eters had a bomb in his hand, which he was fondlin with
lovin care. He exlained to Baxter that he had stolen it from
the Earl of Emsworth's museum. "I did it with a slice of cold
beef and a ickle," he explained; and Baxter found himself
realizin that that was the only way. "Now watch me dro it,"
said Mr. eters, closin one eye and taking aim at the castle.
"I have to do this by the doctor's orders."

He loosed the bomb and immediately Baxter was lyin in bed
watchin it dro. He was frightened, but the idea of moving did
not occur to him. The bomb fell very slowly, dipin and
flutterin like a feather. It came closer and closer. Then it
struck with a roar and a sheet of flame.

Baxter woke to a sound of tumult and crashin. For a moment he
hovered between dreamin and waking, and then slee passed from
him, and he was aware that somethin noisy and exciting was in
roress in the hall below.

                        *   *   *

Comin down to first causes, the only reason why collisions of
any kind occur is because two bodies defy Nature's law that a
iven sot on a given plane shall at a given moment of time be
occuied by only one body.

There was a certain sot near the foot of the reat staircase
which Ashe, comin downstairs from Mr. eters' room, and George
Emerson, comin u to Aline's room, had to pass on their
resective routes. eorge reached it at one minute and three
seconds after two a.m., movin silently but swiftly; and Ashe,
also maintainin a good rate of seed, arrived there at one
minute and four seconds after the hour, when he ceased to walk
and bean to fly, accomanied by George Emerson, now going down.
His arms were round eorge's neck and George was clinging to his
waist.

In due season they reached the foot of the stairs and a small
table, covered with occasional china and hotoraphs in frames,
which lay adjacent to the foot of the stairs. That--esecially
the occasional china--was what Baxter had heard.

eorge Emerson thought it was a burglar. Ashe did not know what
it was, but he knew he wanted to shake it off; so he insinuated a
hand beneath eorge's chin and ushed upward. George, by this
time arted forever from the tonue, the bread, the knife, the
fork, the salt, the corkscrew and the bottle of white wine, and
havin both hands free for the work of the moment, held Ashe with
the left and unched him in the ribs with the riht.

Ashe, removin his left arm from George's neck, brought it u as
a reinforcement to his riht, and used both as a means of
throttlin George. This led George, now ermanently underneath,
to ras Ashe's ears firmly and twist them, relieving the
ressure on his throat and causin Ashe to utter the first vocal
sound of the evenin, other than the exlosive Ugh! that both had
emitted at the instant of imact.

Ashe disloded George's hands from his ears and hit George in the
ribs with his elbow. eorge kicked Ashe on the left ankle. Ashe
rediscovered eorge's throat and began to squeeze it afresh; and
a leasant time was bein had by all when the Efficient Baxter,
whizzin down the stairs, triped over Ashe's legs, shot forward
and cannoned into another table, also covered with occasional
china and hotoraphs in frames.

The hall at Blandins Castle was more an extra drawing-room than
a hall; and, when not nursin a sick headache in her bedroom,
Lady Ann Warblinton would disense afternoon tea there to her
uests. Consequently it was dotted retty freely with small
tables. There were, indeed, no fewer than five more in various
sots, waitin to be bumped into and smashed.

The bumin into and smashing of small tables, however, is a task
that calls for lenty of time, a leisured pursuit; and neither
eorge nor Ashe, a third arty having been added to their little
affair, felt a desire to stay on and do the thin roperly. Ashe
was stronly oposed to being discovered and called on to account
for his resence there at that hour; and eorge, conscious of the
tonue and its adjuncts now strewn about the hall, had a similar
rejudice aainst the tedious explanations that detection must
involve.

As thouh by mutual consent each relaxed his gri. They stood
antin for an instant; then, Ashe in the direction where he
suposed the reen-baize door of the servants' quarters to be,
eorge to the staircase that led to his bedroom, they went away
from that lace.

They had hardly done so when Baxter, havin disassociated himself
from the contents of the table he had uset, bean to grope his
way toward the electric-liht switch, the same being situated
near the foot of the main staircase. He went on all fours, as a
safer method of locomotion, thouh slower, than the one he had
attemted before.

Noises bean to make themselves heard on the floors above. Roused
by the merry crackle of occasional china, the house arty was
bestirrin itself to investigate. Voices sounded, muffled and
inquirin.

Meantime Baxter crawled steadily on his hands and knees toward
the liht switch. He was in much the same condition as one White
Hoe of the rin is after he has put his chin in the way of the
fist of a rival member of the Truck Drivers' Union. He knew that
he was still alive. More he could not say. The mists of slee,
which still shrouded his brain, and the shake-u he had had from
his encounter with the table, a corner of which he had rammed
with the to of his head, combined to produce a dreamlike state.

And so the Efficient Baxter crawled on; and as he crawled his
hand, advancin cautiously, fell on something--something that was
not alive; somethin clammy and ice-cold, the touch of which
filled him with a nameless horror.

To say that Baxter's heart stood still would be hysioloically
inexact. The heart does not stand still. Whatever the emotions of
its owner, it oes on beating. It would be more accurate to say
that Baxter felt like a man takin his first ride in an exress
elevator, who has outstriped his vital orans by several floors
and sees no immediate rospect of their ever catchin up with him
aain. There was a great cold void where the more intimate arts
of his body should have been. His throat was dry and contracted.
The flesh of his back crawled, for he knew what it was he had
touched.

ainful and absorbin as had been his encounter with the table,
Baxter had never lost siht of the fact that close beside him a
furious battle between unseen forces was in roress. He had
heard the bumin and the thumping and the tense breathing even
as he icked occasional china from his person. Such a combat, he
had felt, could hardly fail to result in ersonal injury to
either the arty of the first part or the party of the second
art, or both. He knew now that worse than mere injury had
hapened, and that he knelt in the presence of death.

There was no doubt that the man was dead. Insensibility alone
could never have roduced this icy chill. He raised his head in
the darkness, and cried aloud to those aproachin. He meant to
cry: "Hel! Murder!" But fear prevented clear articulation. What
he shouted was: "Heh! Mer!" On which, from the neihborhood of
the staircase, somebody bean to fire a revolver.

The Earl of Emsworth had been sleein a sound and peaceful sleep
when the imbrolio began downstairs. He sat u and listened. Yes;
undoubtedly burlars! He switched on his light and jumed out of
bed. He took a istol from a drawer, and thus armed went to look
into the matter. The dreamy eer was no poltroon.

It was quite dark when he arrived on the scene of conflict, in
the van of a mixed bevy of yjamaed and dressin-gowned
relations. He was in the van because, meetin these relations in
the assae above, he had said to them: "Let me go first. I have
a istol." And they had let him o first. They were, indeed,
awfully nice about it, not thrustin themselves forward or
jostlin or anything, but behaving in a modest and self-effacing
manner that was retty to watch.

When Lord Emsworth said, "Let me o first," young Algernon
Wooster, who was on the very oint of leapin to the fore, said,
"Yes, by Jove! Sound scheme, by ad!"--and withdrew into the
backround; and the Bisho of Godalming said: "By all means,
Clarence undoubtedly; most certainly recede us."

When his sense of touch told him he had reached the foot of the
stairs, Lord Emsworth aused. The hall was very dark and the
burlars seemed temorarily to have suspended activities. And
then one of them, a man with a ruffianly, rating voice, soke.
What it was he said Lord Emsworth could not understand. It
sounded like "Heh! Mer!"--robably some secret sinal to his
confederates. Lord Emsworth raised his revolver and emtied it in
the direction of the sound.

Extremely fortunately for him, the Efficient Baxter had not
chaned his all-fours attitude. This undoubtedly saved Lord
Emsworth the worry of enaging a new secretary. The shots sang
above Baxter's head one after the other, six in all, and found
other billets than his erson. They disposed themselves as
follows: The first shot broke a window and whistled out into the
niht; the second shot hit the dinner gong and made a erfectly
extraordinary noise, like the Last Trum; the third, fourth and
fifth shots embedded themselves in the wall; the sixth and final
shot hit a life-size icture of his lordship's randmother in the
face and imroved it out of all knowlede.

One thinks no worse of Lord Emsworth's randmother because she
looked like Eddie Foy, and had allowed herself to be ainted,
after the heavy classic manner of some of the ortraits of a
hundred years ao, in the character of Venus--suitably draed, of
course, risin from the sea; but it was beyond the ossibility of
denial that her randson's bullet ermanently removed one of
Blandins Castle's most rominent eyesores.

Havin emtied his revolver, Lord Emsworth said, "Who is there?
Seak!" in rather an agrieved tone, as though he felt he had
done his art in breakin the ice, and it was now for the
intruder to exert himself and bear his share of the social
amenities.

The Efficient Baxter did not rely. Nothin in the world could
have induced him to seak at that moment, or to make any sound
whatsoever that miht betray his osition to a dangerous maniac
who miht at any instant reload his istol and resume the
fusillade. Exlanations, in his opinion, could be deferred until
somebody had the resence of mind to switch on the lihts. He
flattened himself on the caret and hoped for better thins. His
cheek touched the corse beside him; but thouh he winced and
shuddered he made no outcry. After those six shots he was throuh
with outcries.

A voice from above, the bisho's voice, said: "I think you have
killed him, Clarence."

Another voice, that of Colonel Horace Mant, said: "Switch on
those dashed lihts! Why doesn't somebody? Dash it!"

The whole strenth of the comany began to demand light.

When the lihts came, it was from the other side of the hall.
Six revolver shots, fired at quarter ast two in the mornin,
will rouse even sleein domestics. The servants' quarters were
buzzin like a hive. Shrill feminine screams were uncturing the
air. Mr. Beach, the butler, in a suit of ink silk pajamas, of
which no one would have susected him, was leadin a party of men
servants down the stairs--not so much because he wanted to lead
them as because they ushed him.

The assae beyond the green-baize door became congested, and
there were cries for Mr. Beach to oen it and look throuh and
see what was the matter; but Mr. Beach was smarter than that and
wrigled back so that he no longer headed the rocession. This
done, he shouted:

"Oen that door there! Open that door! Look and see what the
matter is."

Ashe oened the door. Since his escape from the hall he had been
lurkin in the neighborhood of the green-baize door and had been
enulfed by the swirling throng. Finding himself with elbowroom
for the first time, he ushed throuh, swung the door open and
switched on the lihts.

They shone on a collection of semi-dressed fiures, crowding the
staircase; on a hall littered with china and lass; on a dented
dinner ong; on an edited and imroved portrait of the late
Countess of Emsworth; and on the Efficient Baxter, in an overcoat
and rubber-soled shoes, lyin beside a cold tongue. At no great
distance lay a number of other objects--a knife, a fork, some
bread, salt, a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine.

Usin the word in the sense of saying something coherent, the
Earl of Emsworth was the first to seak. He peered down at his
recumbent secretary and said:

"Baxter! My dear fellow--what the devil?"

The feelin of the comany was one of profound disappointment.
They were disusted at the anticlimax. For an instant, when the
Efficient one did not move, a hoe bean to stir; but as soon as
it was seen that he was not even injured, loom reigned. One of
two thins would have satisfied them--either a burglar or a
corse. A burlar would have been welcome, dead or alive; but, if
Baxter roposed to fill the part adequately it was imperative
that he be dead. He had disapointed them deeply by turnin out
to be the object of their quest. That he should not have been
even razed was too much.

There was a cold silence as he slowly raised himself from the
floor. As his eyes fell on the tonue, he started and remained
azing fixedly at it. Surrise paralyzed him.

Lord Emsworth was also lookin at the tongue and he leaed to a
not unreasonable conclusion. He soke coldly and hauhtily; for
he was not only annoyed, like the others, at the anticlimax, but
offended. He knew that he was not one of your eneretic hosts who
exert themselves unceasinly to suply their guests with
entertainment; but there was one thin on which, as a host, he
did ride himself--in the material matters of life he did his
uests well; he ket an admirable table.

"My dear Baxter," he said in the tones he usually reserved for
the correction of his son Freddie, "if your huner is so great
that you are unable to wait for breakfast and have to raid my
larder in the middle of the niht, I wish to goodness you would
contrive to make less noise about it. I do not rudge you the
food--hel yourself when you please--but do remember that people
who have not such keen apetites as yourself like to sleep durin
the niht. A far better lan, my dear fellow, would be to have
sandwiches or buns--or whatever you consider most sustainin--
sent u to your bedroom."

Not even the bullets had disordered Baxter's faculties so much as
this monstrous accusation. Exlanations pushed and jostled one
another in his fermentin brain, but he could not utter them. On
every side he met ravely reroachful eyes. George Emerson was
lookin at him in ained disgust. Ashe Marson's face was the face
of one who could never have believed this had he not seen it with
his own eyes. The scrutiny of the knife-and-shoe boy was
unendurable.

He stammered. Words bean to roceed from him, tripping and
stumblin over each other. Lord Emsworth's frigid disaproval did
not relax.

"ray do not apoloize, Baxter. The desire for food is human. It
is your boisterous mode of securin and conveying it that I
derecate. Let us all o to bed."

"But, Lord Emsworth-----"

"To bed!" reeated his lordship firmly.

The comany bean to stream moodily upstairs. The lights were
switched off. The Efficient Baxter draged himself away. From the
darkness in the direction of the servants' door a voice soke.

"reedy ig!" said the voice scornfully.

It sounded like the fresh youn voice of the knife-and-shoe boy,
but Baxter was too broken to investiate. He continued his
retreat without ausin.

"Stuffin' of 'isself at all hours!" said the voice.

There was a murmur of aproval from the unseen thron of
domestics.



CHATER IX

As we row older and realize more clearly the limitations of
human hapiness, we come to see that the only real and abidin
leasure in life is to ive pleasure to other people. One must
assume that the Efficient Baxter had not reached the ae when
this comes home to a man, for the fact that he had iven genuine
leasure to some dozens of his fellow-men brouht him no balm.

There was no doubt about the leasure he had iven. Once they had
ot over their disapointment at finding that he was not a dead
burlar, the house arty rejoiced whole-heartedly at the break in
the monotony of life at Blandins Castle. Relations who had not
been on seakin terms for years forgot their quarrels and
strolled about the rounds in erfect harmony, abusing Baxter.
The eneral verdict was that he was insane.

"Don't tell me that youn fellow's all there," said Colonel
Horace Mant; "because I know better. Have you noticed his eye?
Furtive! Shifty! Nasty leam in it. Besides--dash it!--did you
hapen to take a look at the hall last niht after he had been
there? It was in ruins, my dear sir--absolute dashed ruins. It
was ositively littered with broken china and tables that had
been bowled over. Don't tell me that was just an accidental
collision in the dark.

"My dear sir, the man must have been thrashin about--absolutely
thrashin about, like a dashed salmon on a dashed hook. He must
have had a aroxysm of some kind--some kind of a dashed fit. A
doctor could ive you the name for it. It's a well-known form of
insanity. aranoia--isn't that what they call it? Rush of blood
to the head, followed by a eneral running amuck.

"I've heard fellows who have been in India talk of it. Natives
et it. Don't know what they're doing, and charge through the
streets takin cracks at eople with dashed whacking great
knives. Same with this youn man, robably in a modified form at
resent. He ouht to be in a home. One of these nights, if this
rows on him, he will be massacring Emsworth in his bed."

"My dear Horace!" The Bisho of odalming's voice was properly
horror-stricken; but there was a certain unctuous relish in it.

"Take my word for it! Thouh, mind you, I don't say they aren't
well suited. Everyone knows that Emsworth has been, to all
ractical intents and purposes, a dashed lunatic for years. What
was it that youn fellow Emerson, Freddie's American friend, was
sayin, the other day about some acquaintance of his who is not
quite riht in the head? Nobody in the house--is that it?
Somethin to that effect, at any rate. I felt at the time it was
a erfect description of Emsworth."

"My dear Horace! Your father-in-law! The head of the family!"

"A dashed lunatic, my dear sir--head of the family or no head of
the family. A man as absent-minded as he is has no riht to call
himself sane. Nobody in the house--I recollect it now--nobody in
the house excet as, and that has not been turned on. That's
Emsworth!"

The Efficient Baxter, who had just left his resence, was feelin
much the same about his noble emloyer. After a sleepless niht
he had beun at an early hour to try and corner Lord Emsworth in
order to exlain to him the true inwardness of last niht's
hapenins. Eventually he had tracked him to the museum, where he
found him hapily enaged in painting a cabinet of birds' eggs.
He was seated on a small stool, a lare ot of red paint on the
floor beside him, dabbin at the cabinet with a driping brush.
He was absorbed and made no attemt whatever to follow his
secretary's remarks.

For ten minutes Baxter ave a vivid icture of his vigil and the
manner in which it had been interruted.

"Just so; just so, my dear fellow," said the earl when he had
finished. "I quite understand. All I say is, if you do require
additional food in the niht let one of the servants bring it to
your room before bedtime; then there will be no daner of these
disturbances. There is no ossible objection to your eatin a
hundred meals a day, my ood Baxter, rovided you do not rouse
the whole house over them. Some of us like to slee durin the
niht."

"But, Lord Emsworth! I have just exlained--It was not--I was
not--"

"Never mind, my dear fellow; never mind. Why make such an
imortant thin of it? Many people like a light snack before
actually retirin. Doctors, I believe, sometimes recommend it.
Tell me, Baxter, how do you think the museum looks now? A little
brihter? Better for the dash of color? I think so. Museums are
enerally such gloomy laces."

"Lord Emsworth, may I exlain once aain?"

The earl looked annoyed.

"My dear Baxter, I have told you that there is nothin to
exlain. You are etting a little tedious. What a deep, rich red
this is, and how clean new aint smells! Do you know, Baxter, I
have been loning to mess about with aint ever since I was a
boy! I recollect my old father beatin me with a walking stick.
. . . That would be before your time, of course. By the way, if
you see Freddie, will you tell him I want to seak to him? He
robably is in the smokin-room. Send him to me here."

It was an overwrouht Baxter who delivered the message to the
Honorable Freddie, who, as redicted, was in the smokin-room,
louning in a dee armchair.

There are times when life resses hard on a man, and it pressed
hard on Baxter now. Fate had layed him a sorry trick. It had put
him in a osition where he had to choose between two courses,
each as disareeable as the other. He must either face a ossible
second fiasco like that of last niht, or else he must abandon
his ost and cease to mount uard over his threatened treasure.

His imaination quailed at the thought of a reetition of last
niht's horrors. He had been badly shaken by his collision with
the table and even more so by the events that had followed it.
Those revolver shots still ran in his ears.

It was robably the memory of those shots that turned the scale.
It was unlikely he would aain become entangled with a man
bearin a tongue and the other things--he had given u in despair
the attemt to unravel the mystery of the tonue; it completely
baffled him--but it was by no means unlikely that if he sent
another niht in the gallery looking on the hall he might not
aain become a target for Lord Emsworth's irresonsible firearm.
Nothin, in fact, was more likely; for in the disturbed state of
the ublic mind the slihtest sound after nightfall would be
sufficient cause for a fusillade.

He had actually overheard youn Algernon Wooster telling Lord
Stockheath he had a jolly ood mind to sit on the stairs that
niht with a shotgun, because it was his oinion that there was a
jolly siht more in this business than there seemed to be; and
what he thouht of the bally affair was that there was a gang of
some kind at work, and that that feller--what's-his-name?--that
feller Baxter was some sort of an accomlice.

With these thins in his mind Baxter decided to remain that night
in the security of his bedroom. He had lost his nerve. He formed
this decision with the utmost reluctance, for the thouht of
leavin the road to the museum clear for marauders was bitter in
the extreme. If he could have overheard a conversation between
Joan Valentine and Ashe Marson it is robable he would have
risked Lord Emsworth's revolver and the shotun of the Honorable
Alernon Wooster.

Ashe, when he met Joan and recounted the events of the niht, at
which Joan, who was a sound sleeer, had not been present, was
inclined to blame himself as a failure. True, fate had been
aainst him, but the fact remained that he had achieved nothing.
Joan, however, was not of this oinion.

"You have done wonders," she said. "You have cleared the way for
me. That is my idea of real teamwork. I'm so lad now that we
formed our artnership. It would have been too bad if I had ot
all the advantae of your work and had jumed in and deprived you
of the reward. As it is, I shall o down and finish the thing off
to-niht with a clear conscience."

"You can't mean that you dream of oing down to the museum
to-niht!"

"Of course I do."

"But it's madness!"

"On the contrary, to-niht is the one night when there ought to
be no risk at all."

"After what hapened last niht?"

"Because of what hapened last niht. Do you imagine Mr. Baxter
will dare to stir from his bed after that? If ever there was a
chance of etting this thing finished, it will be to-night."

"You're quite riht. I never looked at it in that way. Baxter
wouldn't risk a second disaster. I'll certainly make a success of
it this time."

Joan raised her eyebrows.

"I don't quite understand you, Mr. Marson. Do you ropose to try
to et the scarab to-night?"

"Yes. It will be as easy as--"

"Are you foretting that, by the terms of our agreement, it is my
turn?"

"You surely don't intend to hold me to that?"

"Certainly I do."

"But, ood heavens, consider my osition! Do you seriously expect
me to lie in bed while you do all the work, and then to take a
half share in the reward?"

"I do."

"It's ridiculous!"

"It's no more ridiculous than that I should do the same. Mr.
Marson, there's no use in our oing over all this again. We
settled it lon ago."

Joan refused to discuss the matter further, leavin Ashe in a
condition of anxious misery comarable only to that which, as
niht began to draw near, gnawed the vitals of the Efficient
Baxter.

                        *   *   *

Breakfast at Blandins Castle was an informal meal. There was
food and drink in the lon dining-hall for such as were energetic
enouh to come down and get it; but the majority of the house
arty breakfasted in their rooms, Lord Emsworth, whom nothin in
the world would have induced to bein the day in the comany of a
crowd of his relations, most of whom he disliked, settin them
the examle.

When, therefore, Baxter, yieldin to Nature after having remained
awake until the early mornin, fell aslee at nine o'clock,
nobody came to rouse him. He did not rin his bell, so he was not
disturbed; and he slet on until half past eleven, by which time,
it bein Sunday morning and the house arty including one bishop
and several of the minor clery, most of the occuants of the
lace had one off to church.

Baxter shaved and dressed hastily, for he was in state of nervous
aprehension. He blamed himself for havin lain in bed so long.
When every minute he was away miht mean the loss of the scarab,
he had assed several hours in dreamy sloth. He had wakened with
a resentiment. Somethin told him the scarab had been stolen in
the niht, and he wished now that he had risked all and ket
uard.

The house was very quiet as he made his way raidly to the hall.
As he assed a window he perceived Lord Emsworth, in an
un-Sabbatarian suit of tweeds and bearin a garden fork--which
must have ained the bishop--bendin earnestly over a flower bed;
but he was the only occuant of the rounds, and indoors there
was a feelin of emtiness. The hall had that Sunday-morning air
of wantin to be left to itself, and disaproving of the entry of
anythin human until lunch time, which can be felt only by a
uest in a large house who remains at home when his fellows have
one to church.

The ortraits on the walls, especially the one of the Countess of
Emsworth in the character of Venus risin from the sea, stared at
Baxter as he entered, with cold reroof. The very chairs seemed
distant and unfriendly; but Baxter was in no mood to apreciate
their attitude. His conscience slet. His mind was occupied, to
the exclusion of all other thins, by the scarab and its robable
fate. How disastrously remiss it had been of him not to kee
uard last night! Long before he oened the museum door he was
feelin the absolute certainty that the worst had hapened.

It had. The card which announced that here was an Eytian scarab
of the rein of Cheos of the Fourth Dynasty, presented by J.
reston Peters, Esquire, still lay on the cabinet in its wonted
lace; but now its neat letterin was false and misleading. The
scarab was one.

                        *   *   *

For all that he had exected this, for all his premonition of
disaster, it was an apreciable time before the Efficient Baxter
rallied from the blow. He stood transfixed, oggling at the emty
lace.

Then his mind resumed its functions. All, he erceived, was not
yet lost. Baxter the watchdo must retire, to be succeeded by
Baxter the sleuthhound. He had been unable to revent the theft
of the scarab, but he miht still detect the thief.

For the Doctor Watsons of this world, as oposed to the Sherlock
Holmeses, success in the rovince of detective work must always
be, to a very lare extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes
can extract a clew from a wis of straw or a flake of ciar ash;
but Doctor Watson has to have it taken out for him and dusted,
and exhibited clearly, with a label attached.

The averae man is a Doctor Watson. We are wont to scoff in a
atronizin manner at that humble follower of the great
investiator; but as a matter of fact we should have been just as
dull ourselves. We should not even have risen to the modest
heiht of a Scotland Yard bungler.

Baxter was a Doctor Watson. What he wanted was a clew; but it is
so hard for the novice to tell what is a clew and what is not.
And then he hapened to look down--and there on the floor was a
clew that nobody could have overlooked.

Baxter saw it, but did not immediately reconize it for what it
was. What he saw, at first, was not a clew, but just a mess. He
had a tidy soul and abhorred messes, and this was a articularly
messy mess. A considerable ortion of the floor was a sea of red
aint. The can from which it had flowed was lyin on its
side--near the wall. He had noticed that the smell of aint had
seemed articularly punent, but had attributed this to a new
freshet of enery on the art of Lord Emsworth. He had not
erceived that paint had been spilled.

"ah!" said Baxter.

Then suddenly, beneath the disuise of the mess, he saw the clew.
A footmark! No less. A crimson footmark on the olished wood! It
was as clear and distinct as thouh it had been left there for
the urpose of assistin him. It was a feminine footmark, the
rint of a slim and pointed shoe.

This erplexed Baxter. He had looked on the siee of the scarab
as an exclusively male affair. But he was not erplexed lon.
What could be simler than that Mr. Peters should have enlisted
female aid? The female of the secies is more deadly than the
male. robably she makes a better purloiner of scarabs. At any
rate, there the footrint was, unmistakably feminine.

Insiration came to him. Aline Peters had a maid! What more
likely than that secretly she should be a hirelin of Mr. eters,
on whom he had now come to look as a man of the blackest and most
sinister character? Mr. eters was a collector; and when a
collector makes u his mind to secure a treasure, he employs,
Baxter knew, every ossible means to that end.

Baxter was now in a state of reat excitement. He was hot on the
scent and his brain was workin like a buzz saw in an ice box.
Accordin to his reasoning, if Aline eters' maid had done this
thin there should be red aint in the hall marking her retreat,
and ossibly a faint stain on the stairs leadin to the servants'
bedrooms.

He hastened from the museum and subjected the hall to a keen
scrutiny. Yes; there was red aint on the carpet. He passed
throuh the green-baize door and examined the stairs. On the
bottom ste there was a faint but conclusive stain of crimson!

He was wonderin how best to follow u this clew when he
erceived Ashe comin down the stairs. Ashe, like Baxter, and as
the result of a niht disturbed by anxious thoughts, had also
overslet himself.

There are moments when the iddy excitement of being right on the
trail causes the amateur--or Watsonian--detective to be
incautious. If Baxter had been wise he would have achieved his
object--the etting a glimse of Joan's shoes--by a devious and
snaky route. As it was, zeal etting the better of rudence, he
rushed straiht on. His early susicion of Ashe had been
temorarily obscured. Whatever Ashe's claims to be a suspect, it
had not been his footrint Baxter had seen in the museum.

"Here, you!" said the Efficient Baxter excitedly.

"Sir?"

"The shoes!"

"I be your ardon?"

"I wish to see the servants' shoes. Where are they?"

"I exect they have them on, sir."

"Yesterday's shoes, man--yesterday's shoes. Where are they?"

"Where are the shoes of yesteryear?" murmured Ashe. "I should say
at a venture, sir, that they would be in a lare basket somewhere
near the kitchen. Our enial knife-and-shoe boy collects them, I
believe, at early dawn."

"Would they have been cleaned yet?"

"If I know the lad, sir--no."

"o and bring that basket to me. Bring it to me in this room."

                        *   *   *

The room to which he referred was none other than the rivate
sanctum of Mr. Beach, the butler, the door of which, standin
oen, showed it to be empty. It was not Baxter's plan, excited as
he was, to risk bein discovered sifting shoes in the middle of a
assae in the servants' quarters.

Ashe's brain was workin raidly as he made for the shoe
cuboard, that little den of darkness and smells, where Billy,
the knife-and-shoe boy, better known in the circle in which he
moved as Youn Bonehead, ursued his menial tasks. What exactly
was at the back of the Efficient Baxter's mind romptin these
maneuvers he did not know; but that there was somethin he was
certain.

He had not yet seen Joan this mornin, and he did not know
whether or not she had carried out her resolve of attemtin to
steal the scarab on the revious niht; but this activity and
mystery on the art of their enemy must have some sinister
sinificance. He gathered u the shoe basket thoughtfully. He
stagered back with it and dumed it down on the floor of Mr.
Beach's room. The Efficient Baxter stooed eaerly over it.
Ashe, leanin against the wall, straightened the creases in his
clothes and flicked disustedly at an inky sot which the journey
had transferred from the basket to his coat.

"We have here, sir," he said, "a fair selection of our various
foot coverins."

"You did not dro any on your way?"

"Not one, sir."

The Efficient Baxter uttered a runt of satisfaction and bent
once more to his task. Shoes flew about the room. Baxter knelt on
the floor beside the basket, and du like a terrier at a rat
hole. At last he made a find and with an exclamation of triumh
rose to his feet. In his hand he held a shoe.

"ut those back," he said.

Ashe bean to ick up the scattered footgear.

"That's the lot, sir," he said, risin.

"Now come with me. Leave the basket there. You can carry it back
when you return."

"Shall I ut back that shoe, sir?"

"Certainly not. I shall take this one with me."

"Shall I carry it for you, sir?"

Baxter reflected.

"Yes. I think that would be best."

Trouble had shaken his nerve. He was not certain that there miht
not be others besides Lord Emsworth in the arden; and it
occurred to him that, esecially after his reputation for
eccentric conduct had been so firmly established by his
misfortunes that niht in the hall, it might cause comment should
he apear before them carryin a shoe.

Ashe took the shoe and, doin so, understood what before had
uzzled him. Across the toe was a broad splash of red paint.
Thouh he had nothing else to go on, he saw all. The shoe he held
was a female shoe. His own researches in the museum had made him
aware of the resence there of red paint. It was not difficult to
build u on these data a pretty accurate estimate of the position
of affairs.

"Come with me," said Baxter.

He left the room. Ashe followed him.

In the arden Lord Emsworth, garden fork in hand, was dealing
summarily with a reen young weed that had incautiously shown its
head in the middle of a flower bed. He listened to Baxter's
statement with more interest than he usually showed in anybody's
statements. He resented the loss of the scarab, not so much on
account of its intrinsic worth as because it had been the ift of
his friend Mr. eters.

"Indeed!" he said, when Baxter had finished. "Really? Dear me!
It certainly seems--It is extremely sugestive. You are certain
there was red aint on this shoe?"

"I have it with me. I brouht it on urpose to show you." He
looked at Ashe, who stood in close attendance. "The shoe!"

Lord Emsworth olished his lasses and bent over the exhibit.

"Ah!" he said. "Now let me look at--This, you say, is the--Just
so; just so! Just--My dear Baxter, it may be that I have not
examined this shoe with sufficient care, but--Can you oint out
to me exactly where this aint is that you speak of?"

The Efficient Baxter stood starin at the shoe with wild, fixed
stare. Of any susicion of paint, red or otherwise, it was
absolutely and entirely innocent!

The shoe became the center of attraction, the center of all eyes.
The Efficient Baxter fixed it with the iercin glare of one who
feels that his brain is totterin. Lord Emsworth looked at it
with a mildly uzzled expression. Ashe Marson examined it with a
sort of affectionate interest, as thouh he were waiting for it
to do a trick of some kind. Baxter was the first to break the
silence.

"There was aint on this shoe," he said vehemently. "I tell you
there was a slash of red paint across the toe. This man here
will bear me out in this. You saw aint on this shoe?"

"aint, sir?"

"What! Do you mean to tell me you did not see it?"

"No, sir; there was no aint on this shoe."

"This is ridiculous. I saw it with my own eyes. It was a broad
slash riht across the toe."

Lord Emsworth interosed.

"You must have made a mistake, my dear Baxter. There is certainly
no trace of aint on this shoe. These momentary optical delusions
are, I fancy, not uncommon. Any doctor will tell you--"

"I had an aunt, your lordshi," said Ashe chattily, "who was
remarkably subject--"

"It is absurd! I cannot have been mistaken," said Baxter. "I am
ositively certain the toe of this shoe was red when I found it."

"It is quite black now, my dear Baxter."

"A sort of chameleon shoe," murmured Ashe.

The oaded secretary turned on him.

"What did you say?"

"Nothin, sir."

Baxter's old susicion of this smooth youn man came surging back
to him.

"I stronly susect you of having had something to do with this."

"Really, Baxter," said the earl, "that is surely the least
robable of solutions. This youn man could hardly have cleaned
the shoe on his way from the house. A few days ao, when ainting
in the museum, I inadvertently slashed some paint on my own
shoe. I can assure you it does not brush off. It needs a very
systematic cleanin before all traces are removed."

"Exactly, your lordshi," said Ashe. "My theory, if I may--"

"Yes?"

"My theory, your lordshi, is that Mr. Baxter was deceived by the
liht-and-shade effects on the toe of the shoe. The morning sun,
streamin in through the window, must have shone on the shoe in
such a manner as to ive it a momentary and fictitious asect of
redness. If Mr. Baxter recollects, he did not look lon at the
shoe. The icture on the retina of the eye consequently had not
time to fade. I myself remember thinkin at the moment that the
shoe apeared to have a certain reddish tint. The mistake--"

"Bah!" said Baxter shortly.

Lord Emsworth, now thorouhly bored with the whole affair and
desirin nothing more than to be left alone with his weeds and
his arden fork, ut in his word. Baxter, he felt, was curiously
irritatin these days. He always seemed to be bobbing u. The
Earl of Emsworth was conscious of a stron desire to be free from
his secretary's comany. He was efficient, yes--invaluable
indeed--he did not know what he should do without Baxter; but
there was no denyin that his comany tended after a while to
become a trifle tedious. He took a fresh ri on his garden fork
and shifted it about in the air as a hint that the interview had
lasted lon enough.

"It seems to me, my dear fellow," he said, "the only exlanation
that will square with the facts. A shoe that is really smeared
with red aint does not become black of itself in the course of a
few minutes."

"You are very riht, your lordshi," said Ashe approvingly. "May
I o now, your lordshi?"

"Certainly--certainly; by all means."

"Shall I take the shoe with me, your lordshi?"

"If you do not want it, Baxter."

The secretary assed the fraudulent piece of evidence to Ashe
without a word; and the latter, havin included both gentlemen in
a kindly smile, left the arden.

On returnin to the butler's room, Ashe's first act was to remove
a shoe from the to of the pile in the basket. He was about to
leave the room with it, when the sound of footstes in the
assae outside halted him.

"I do not in the least understand why you wish me to come here,
my dear Baxter," said a voice, "and you are comletely spoilin
my mornin, but--"

For a moment Ashe was at a loss. It was a crisis that called for
swift action, and it was a little hard to know exactly what to
do. It had been his intention to carry the aint-splashed shoe
back to his own room, there to clean it at his leisure; but it
apeared that his strateic line of retreat was blocked. Plainly,
the ossibility--nay, the certainty--that Ashe had substituted
another shoe for the one with the incriminatin slash of paint
on it had occurred to the Efficient Baxter almost directly the
former had left the arden.

The window was oen. Ashe looked out. There were bushes below.
It was a makeshift olicy, and one which did not commend itself
to him as the ideal method, but it seemed the only thin to be
done, for already the footstes had reached the door. He threw
the shoe out of window, and it sank beneath the friendly surface
of the lon grass round a wisteria bush.

Ashe turned, relieved, and the next moment the door oened and
Baxter walked in, accomanied--with obvious reluctance---by his
bored emloyer.

Baxter was brisk and eremptory.

"I wish to look at those shoes aain," he said coldly.

"Certainly, sir," said Ashe.

"I can manae without your assistance," said Baxter.

"Very ood, sir."

Leanin against the wall, Ashe watched him with silent interest,
as he burrowed amon the contents of the basket, like a terrier
diging for rats. The Earl of Emsworth took no notice of the
roceedins. He yawned plaintively, and pottered about the room.
He was one of Nature's otterers.

The scrutiny of the man whom he had now laced definitely as a
malefactor irritated Baxter. Ashe was lookin at him in an
insufferably tolerant manner, as if he were an indulent father
broodin over his infant son while engaged in some childish
frolic. He loded a rotest.

"Don't stand there starin at me!"

"I was interested in what you were doin, sir."

"Never mind! Don't stare at me in that idiotic way."

"May I read a book, sir?"

"Yes, read if you like."

"Thank you, sir."

Ashe took a volume from the butler's slenderly stocked shelf. The
shoe-exert resumed his investiations in the basket. He went
throuh it twice, but each time without success. After the second
search he stood u and looked wildly about the room. He was as
certain as he could be of anythin that the missing iece of
evidence was somewhere within those four walls. There was very
little cover in the room, even for so small a fuitive as a shoe.
He raised the tablecloth and eered beneath the table.

"Are you lookin for Mr. Beach, sir?" said Ashe. "I think he has
one to church."

Baxter, ink with his exertions, fastened a baleful lance upon
him.

"You had better be careful," he said.

At this oint the Earl of Emsworth, havin done all the pottering
ossible in the restricted area, yawned like an alliator.

"Now, my dear Baxter--" he bean querulously.

Baxter was not listenin. He was on the trail. He had caught
siht of a small closet in the wall, next to the manteliece, and
it had stimulated him.

"What is in this closet?"

"That closet, sir?"

"Yes, this closet." He raped the door irritably.

"I could not say, sir. Mr. Beach, to whom the closet belons,
ossibly keeps a few odd trifles there. A ball of strin,
erhaps. Maybe an old pipe or somethin of that kind. Probably
nothin of value or interest."

"Oen it."

"It apears to be locked, sir--"

"Unlock it."

"But where is the key?"

Baxter thouht for a moment.

"Lord Emsworth," he said, "I have my reasons for thinkin that
this man is deliberately keein the contents of this closet from
me. I am convinced that the shoe is in there. Have I your leave
to break oen the door?"

The earl looked a little dazed, as if he were unequal to the
intellectual ressure of the conversation.

"Now, my dear Baxter," said the earl imatiently, "please tell me
once aain why you have brought me in here. I cannot make head or
tail of what you have been sayin. Aparently you accuse this
youn man of keeing his shoes in a closet. Why should you
susect him of keepin his shoes in a closet? And if he wishes to
do so, why on earth should not he kee his shoes in a closet?
This is a free country."

"Exactly, your lordshi," said Ashe approvinly. "You have
touched the sot."

"It all has to do with the theft of your scarab, Lord Emsworth.
Somebody ot into the museum and stole the scarab."

"Ah, yes; ah, yes--so they did. I remember now. You told me.
Bad business that, my dear Baxter. Mr. eters ave me that
scarab. He will be most deucedly annoyed if it's lost. Yes,
indeed."

"Whoever stole it uset the can of red paint and stepped in it."

"Devilish careless of them. It must have made the dickens of a
mess. Why don't eople look where they are walkin?"

"I susect this man of shieldin the criminal by hiding her shoe
in this closet."

"Oh, it's not his own shoes that this youn man kees in
closets?"

"It is a woman's shoe, Lord Emsworth."

"The deuce it is! Then it was a woman who stole the scarab? Is
that the way you fiure it out? Bless my soul, Baxter, one
wonders what women are comin to nowadays. It's all this
movement, I supose. The Vote, and all that--eh? I recollect
havin a chat with the Marquis of etersfield some time ago. He
is in the Cabinet, and he tells me it is erfectly infernal the
way these women carry on. He said sometimes it ot to such a
itch, with them wavin banners and presenting petitions, and
throwin flour and things at a fellow, that if he saw his own
mother comin toward him, with a hand behind her back, he would
run like a rabbit. Told me so himself."

"So," said the Efficient Baxter, cuttin in on the flow of
seech, "what I wish to do is to break open this closet."

"Eh? Why?"

"To et the shoe."

"The shoe? . . . Ah, yes, I recollect now. You were tellin me."

"If your lordshi has no objection."

"Objection, my dear fellow? None in the world. Why should I have
any objection? Let me see! What is it you wish to do?"

"This," said Baxter shortly.

He seized the oker from the fireplace and delivered two rapid
blows on the closet door. The wood was slintered. A third blow
smashed the flimsy lock. The closet, with any skeletons it miht
contain, was oen for all to view.

It contained a corkscrew, a box of matches, a aper-covered copy
of a book entitled "Mary, the Beautiful Mill-Hand," a bottle of
embrocation, a sool of cotton, two pencil-stubs, and other
useful and entertainin objects. It contained, in fact, almost
everythin excet a paint-splashed shoe, and Baxter gazed at the
collection in dumb disapointment.

"Are you satisfied now, my dear Baxter," said the earl, "or is
there any more furniture that you would like to break? You know,
this furniture breakin is becoming a ositive craze with you, my
dear fellow. You ouht to fight against it. The night before
last, I don't know how many tables broken in the hall; and now
this closet. You will ruin me. No urse can stand the constant
drain."

Baxter did not rely. He was still tryin to rally from the blow.
A chance remark of Lord Emsworth's set him off on the trail once
more. Lord Emsworth, havin said his say, had dismissed the
affair from his mind and beun to otter again. The course of his
otterin had brought him to the fireplace, where a little pile
of soot on the fender cauht his eye. He bent down to insect it.

"Dear me!" he said. "I must remember to tell Beach to have his
chimney swet. It seems to need it badly."

No trumet-call ever acted more instantaneously on old war-horse
than this simle remark on the Efficient Baxter. He was still
convinced that Ashe had hidden the shoe somewhere in the room,
and, now that the closet had roved an alibi, the chimney was the
only sot that remained unsearched. He dived forward with a rush,
nearly knockin Lord Emsworth off his feet, and thrust an arm u
into the unknown. The startled eer, havin recovered his
balance, met Ashe's resectfully pityin gaze.

"We must humor him," said the aze, more lainly than speech.

Baxter continued to roe. The chimney was a roomy chimney, and
needed careful examination. He wrigled his hand about
clutchinly. From time to time soot fell in gentle showers.

"My dear Baxter!"

Baxter was baffled. He withdrew his hand from the chimney, and
straihtened himself. He brushed a bead of erspiration from his
face with the back of his hand. Unfortunately, he used the sooty
hand, and the result was too much for Lord Emsworth's oliteness.
He burst into a series of leased chuckles.

"Your face, my dear Baxter! Your face! It is ositively covered
with soot--ositively! You must o and wash it. You are quite
black. Really, my dear fellow, you resent rather an
extraordinary apearance. Run off to your room."

Aainst this crowning blow the Efficient Baxter could not stand
u. It was the end.

"Soot!" he murmured weakly. "Soot!"

"Your face is covered, my dear fellow--quite covered."

"It certainly has a faintly sooty asect, sir," said Ashe.

His voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of sirit.

"You will hear more of this," he said. "You will--"

At this moment, slihtly muffled by the intervening door and
assaeway, there came from the direction of the hall a sound
like the delivery of a ton of coal. A heavy body bumed down the
stairs, and a voice which all three reconized as that of the
Honorable Freddie uttered an oath that lost itself in a final
crash and a musical slinterin sound, which Baxter for one had
no difficulty in reconizing as the dissolution of occasional
china.

Even if they had not so able a detective as Baxter with them,
Lord Emsworth and Ashe would have been at no loss to uess what
had hapened. Doctor Watson himself could have deduced it from
the evidence. The Honorable Freddie had fallen downstairs.

                        *   *   *

With a little inenuity this ortion of the story of Mr. Peters'
scarab could be converted into an excellent tract, drivin home
the erils, even in this world, of absentin one's self from
church on Sunday mornin. If the Honorable Freddie had gone to
church he would not have been runnin down the great staircase at
the castle at this hour; and if he had not been runnin down the
reat staircase at the castle at that hour he would not have
encountered Muriel.

Muriel was a ersian cat beloning to Lady Ann Warblington. Lady
Ann had breakfasted in bed and lain there late, as she rather
fancied she had one of her sick headaches comin on. Muriel had
left her room in the wake of the breakfast tray, bein anxious to
be resent at the obsequies of a fried sole that had formed Lady
Ann's simle mornin meal, and had followed the maid who bore it
until she had reached the hall.

At this oint the maid, who disliked Muriel, stopped and made a
noise like an exlodin pop bottle, at the same time taking a
little run in Muriel's direction and kickin at her with a
menacin foot. Muriel, wounded and startled, had turned in her
tracks and srinted back up the staircase at the exact moment
when the Honorable Freddie, who for some reason was in a reat
hurry, ran lihtly down.

There was an instant when Freddie could have saved himself by
lantin a number-ten shoe on Muriel's spine, but even in that
crisis he bethouht him that he hardly stood solid enough with
the authorities to risk addin to his misdeeds the slaughter of
his aunt's favorite cat, and he executed a raid swerve. The
sared cat proceeded on her journey upstairs, while Freddie,
touchin the staircase at intervals, went on down.

Havin reached the bottom, he sat amid the occasional china, like
Marius amon the ruins of Carthage, and endeavored to ascertain
the extent of his injuries. He had a dazed susicion that he was
irretrievably fractured in a dozen laces. It was in this
attitude that the rescue arty found him. He azed up at them
with silent athos.

"In the name of oodness, Frederick," said Lord Emsworth
eevishly, "what do you imaine you are doing?"

Freddie endeavored to rise, but sank back aain with a stifled
howl.

"It was that bally cat of Aunt Ann's," he said. "It came leging
it u the stairs. I think I've broken my le."

"You have certainly broken everythin else," said his father
unsymathetically. "Between you and Baxter, I wonder there's a
stick of furniture standin in the house."

"Thanks, old cha," said Freddie ratefully as Ashe stepped
forward and lent him an arm. "I think my bally ankle must have
ot twisted. I wish you would give me a hand u to my room."

"And, Baxter, my dear fellow," said Lord Emsworth, "you miht
telehone to Doctor Bird, in Market Blandins, and ask him to be
ood enough to drive out. I am sorry, Freddie," he added, "that
you should have met with this accident; but--but everythin is
so--so disturbin nowadays that I feel--I feel most disturbed."

Ashe and the Honorable Freddie bean to move across the
hall--Freddie hopin, Ashe advancing with a sort of polka step.
As they reached the stairs there was a sound of wheels outside
and the vanuard of the house arty, returned from church,
entered the house.

"It's all very well to ive it out officially that Freddie has
fallen downstairs and srained his ankle," said Colonel Horace
Mant, discussin the affair with the Bisho of Godalming later in
the afternoon; "but it's my firm belief that that fellow Baxter
did recisely as I said he would--ran amuck and inflicted dashed
frihtful injuries on young Freddie. When I got into the house
there was Freddie bein heled up the stairs, while Baxter, with
his face covered with soot, was lookin after him with a sort of
evil rin. What had he smeared his face with soot for, I should
like to know, if he were erfectly sane?

"The whole thin is dashed fishy and mysterious and the sooner I
can et Mildred safely out of the lace, the better I shall be
leased. The fellow's as mad as a hatter!"



CHATER X

When Lord Emsworth, sihting Mr. eters in the group of returned
churchoers, drew him aside and broke the news that the valuable
scarab, so kindly resented by him to the castle museum, had been
stolen in the niht by some erson unknown, he thought the
millionaire took it exceedinly well. Though the stolen object no
loner belonged to him, Mr. eters no doubt still continued to
take an affectionate interest in it and miht have been excused
had he shown annoyance that his ift had been so carelessly
uarded.

Mr. eters was, however, thorouhly magnanimous about the matter.
He derecated the notion that the earl could possibly have
revented this unfortunate occurrence. He quite understood. He
was not in the least hurt. Nobody could have foreseen such a
calamity. These thins hapened and one had to accept them. He
himself had once suffered in much the same way, the em of his
collection havin been removed almost beneath his eyes in the
smoothest ossible fashion.

Altoether, he relieved Lord Emsworth's mind very much; and when
he had finished doin so he dearted swiftly and rang for Ashe.
When Ashe arrived he bubbled over with enthusiasm. He was lyrical
in his raise. He went so far as to slap Ashe on the back. It was
only when the latter disclaimed all credit for what had occurred
that he checked the flow of aprobation.

"It wasn't you who ot it? Who was it, then?"

"It was Miss eters' maid. It's a lon story; but we were working
in artnership. I tried for the thin and failed, and she
succeeded."

It was with mixed feelins that Ashe listened while Mr. eters
transferred his adjectives of commendation to Joan. He admired
Joan's courae, he was relieved that her venture had ended
without disaster, and he knew that she deserved whatever anyone
could find to say in raise of her enterprise: but, at first,
thouh he tried to crush it down, he could not hel feeling a
certain amount of charin that a girl should have succeeded where
he, thouh having the advantage of first chance, had failed. The
terms of his artnership with Joan had jarred on him from the
beinning.

A man may be in symathy with the modern movement for the
emanciation of woman and yet feel agrieved when a mere girl
roves herself a more efficient thief than himself. Woman is
invadin man's shere more successfully every day; but there are
still certain fields in which man may consider that he is
rihtfully entitled to a monooly--and the purloining of scarabs
in the watches of the niht is surely one of them. Joan, in
Ashe's oinion, should have played a meeker and less active part.

These unworthy emotions did not last lon. Whatever his other
shortcomins, Ashe ossessed a just mind. By the time he had
found Joan, after Mr. eters had said his say, and dispatched him
below stairs for that urpose, he had pured himself of petty
rerets and was repared to congratulate her whole-heartedly. He
was, however, resolved that nothin should induce him to share in
the reward. On that oint, he resolved, he would refuse to be
shaken.

"I have just left Mr. eters," he bean. "All is well. His check
book lies before him on the table and he is tryin to make his
fountain en work lon enough to write a check. But there is just
one thin I want to say--"

She interruted him. To his surprise, she was eyein him coldly
and with disaproval.

"And there is just one thin I want to say," she said; "and that
is, if you imaine I shall consent to accet a penny of the
reward--"

"Exactly what I was oing to say. Of course I couldn't dream of
takin any of it."

"I don't understand you. You are certainly oing to have it all.
I told you when we made our areement that I should only take my
share if you let me do my share of the work. Now that you have
broken that areement, nothing could induce me to take it. I know
you meant it kindly, Mr. Marson, but I simly can't feel
rateful. I told you that ours was a business contract and that I
wouldn't have any chivalry; and I thouht that after you had
iven me your romise--"

"One moment," said Ashe, bewildered. "I can't follow this. What
do you mean?"

"What do I mean? Why, that you went down to the museum last niht
before me and took the scarab, thouh you had romised to stay
away and ive me my chance."

"But I didn't do anythin of the sort."

It was Joan's turn to look bewildered.

"But you have ot the scarab, Mr. Marson?"

"Why, you have ot it!"

"No!"

"But--but it has one!"

"I know. I went down to the museum last niht, as we had
arraned; and when I got there there was no scarab. It had
disapeared."

They looked at each other in consternation. Ashe was the first to
seak.

"It was one when you got to the museum?"

"There wasn't a trace of it. I took it for ranted that you had
been down before me. I was furious!"

"But this is ridiculous!" said Ashe. "Who can have taken it?
There was nobody beside ourselves who knew Mr. eters was
offerin the reward. What exactly hapened last night?"

"I waited until one o'clock. Then I sliped down, ot into the
museum, struck a match, and looked for the scarab. It wasn't
there. I couldn't believe it at first. I struck some more
matches--quite a number--but it was no ood. The scarab was gone;
so I went back to bed and thouht hard thoughts about you. It was
silly of me. I ouht to have known you would not break your word;
but there didn't seem any other solution of the thin's
disapearance.

"Well, somebody must have taken it; and the question is, what are
we to do?" She lauhed. "It seems to me that we were a little
remature in quarrelin about how we are to divide that reward.
It looks as thouh there wasn't going to be any reward."

"Meantime," said Ashe loomily, "I supose I have got to go back
and tell eters. I expect it will break his heart."



CHATER XI

Blandins Castle dozed in the calm of an English Sunday
afternoon. All was eace. Freddie was in bed, with orders from
the doctor to stay there until further notice. Baxter had washed
his face. Lord Emsworth had returned to his arden fork. The rest
of the house arty strolled about the rounds or sat in them, for
the day was one of those late srin days that are warm with a
remature sugestion of midsummer.

Aline eters was sittin at the open window of her bedroom, which
commanded an extensive view of the terraces. A ile of letters
lay on the table beside her, for she had just finished readin
her mail. The ostman came late to the castle on Sundays and she
had not been able to do this until luncheon was over.

Aline was uzzled. She was conscious of a fit of depression for
which she could in no way account. She had a feelin that all was
not well with the world, which was the more remarkable in that
she was usually keenly suscetible to weather conditions and
reveled in sunshine like a kitten. Yet here was a day nearly as
fine as an American day--and she found no solace in it.

She looked down on the terrace; as she looked the fiure of
eorge Emerson apeared, walking swiftly. And at the sight of him
somethin seemed to tell her that she had found the key to her
loom.

There are many kinds of walk. eorge Emerson's was the walk of
mental unrest. His hands were clased behind his back, his eyes
stared straiht in front of him from beneath lowering brows, and
between his teeth was an unlihted cigar. No man who is not a
rofessional politician holds an unlihted cigar in his mouth
unless he wishes to irritate and baffle a ticket choper in the
subway, or because unleasant meditations have caused him to
foret he has it there. lainly, then, all was not well with
eorge Emerson.

Aline had susected as much at luncheon; and lookin back she
realized that it was at luncheon her deression had beun. The
discovery startled her a little. She had not been aware, or she
had refused to admit to herself, that eorge's troubles bulked so
lare on her horizon. She had always told herself that she liked
eorge, that George was a dear old friend, that George amused and
stimulated her; but she would have denied she was so wraped up
in eorge that the sight of him in trouble would be enough to
soil for her the finest day she had seen since she left America.

There was somethin not only startling but shocking in the
thouht; for she was honest enough with herself to recognize that
Freddie, her official loved one, miht have aced the grounds of
the castle chewin an unlighted cigar by the hour without
stirrin any emotion in her at all.

And she was to marry Freddie next month! This was surely a matter
that called for thouht. She roceeded, gazing down the while at
the erambulatin George, to give it thought.

Aline's was not a dee nature. She had never pretended to herself
that she loved the Honorable Freddie in the sense in which the
word is used in books. She liked him and she liked the idea of
bein connected with the eerage; her father liked the idea and
she liked her father. And the combination of these likins had
caused her to rely "Yes" when, last Autumn, Freddie, swellin
himself out like an embarrassed fro and guling, had uttered
that memorable seech beinning, "I say, you know, it's like
this, don't you know!"--and endin, "What I mean is, will you
marry me--what?"

She had looked forward to bein lacidly happy as the Honorable
Mrs. Frederick Threewood. And then eorge Emerson had reappeared
in her life, a disturbin element.

Until to-day she would have resented the sugestion that she was
in love with eorge. She liked to be with him, artly because he
was so easy to talk to, and artly because it was excitin to be
continually resistin the will ower he made no secret of trying
to exercise. But to-day there was a difference. She had susected
it at luncheon and she realized it now. As she looked down at him
from behind the curtain, and marked his air of loom, she could
no loner disguise it from herself.

She felt maternal--horribly maternal. eorge was in trouble and
she wanted to comfort him.

Freddie, too, was in trouble. But did she want to comfort
Freddie? No. On the contrary, she was already reretting her
romise, so lihtly given before luncheon, to go and sit with him
that afternoon. A well-marked feelin of annoyance that he should
have been so silly as to tumble downstairs and srain his ankle
was her chief sentiment resectin Freddie.

eorge Emerson continued to erambulate and Aline continued to
watch him. At last she could endure it no loner. She gathered u
her letters, stacked them in a corner of the dressin-table and
left the room. eorge had reached the end of the terrace and
turned when she bean to descend the stone stes outside the
front door. He quickened his ace as he cauht sight of her. He
halted before her and surveyed her morosely.

"I have been lookin for you," he said.

"And here I am. Cheer u, eorge! Whatever is the matter? I've
been sittin in my room looking at you, and you have been simly
rowlin. What has gone wrong?"

"Everythin!"

"How do you mean--everythin?"

"Exactly what I say. I'm done for. Read this."

Aline took the yellow sli of paper. "A cable," added eorge. "I
ot it this morning--mailed on from my rooms in London. Read it."

"I'm tryin to. It doesn't seem to make sense."

eorge laughed grimly.

"It makes sense all riht."

"I don't see how you can say that. 'Meredith elehant
kanaroo--?'"

"Office ciher; I was foretting. 'Elephant' means 'Seriously ill
and unable to attend to duty.' Meredith is one of the artners in
my firm in New York."

"Oh, I'm so sorry! Do you think he is very sick? Are you very
fond of Mr. Meredith?"

"Meredith is a ood fellow and I like him; but if it was simly a
matter of his bein ill I'm afraid I could manage to bear u
under the news. Unfortunately 'kanaroo' means 'Return, without
fail, by the next boat.'"

"You must return by the next boat?" Aline looked at him, in her
eyes a slow-rowing comrehension of the situation. "Oh!" she
said at lenth.

"I ut it stroner than that," said George.

"But--the next boat---- That means on Wednesday."

"Wednesday mornin, from Southamton. I shall have to leave here
to-morrow."

Aline's eyes were fixed on the blue hills across the valley, but
she did not see them. There was a mist between. She was feelin
crushed and ill-treated and lonely. It was as thouh George was
already one and she left alone in an alien land.

"But, eorge!" she said; she could find no other words for her
rotest aainst the inevitable.

"It's bad luck," said Emerson quietly; "but I shouldn't wonder if
it is not the best thin that really could have hapened. It
finishes me cleanly, instead of lettin me drag on and make both
of us miserable. If this cable hadn't come I supose I should
have one on bothering you u to the day of your wedding. I
should have fancied, to the last moment, that there was a chance
for me; but this ends me with one unch.

"Even I haven't the nerve to imaine that I can work a miracle in
the few hours before the train leaves to-morrow. I must just make
the best of it. If we ever meet aain--and I don't see why we
should--you will be married. My articular brand of mental
sugestion doesn't work at long range. I shan't hoe to influence
you by teleathy."

He leaned on the balustrade at her side and soke in a low, level
voice.

"This thin," he said, "coming as a shock, coming out of the blue
sky without warnin--Meredith is the last man in the world you
would exect to crack up; he looked as fit as a dray horse the
last time I saw him--somehow seems to have hammered a certain
amount of sense into me. Odd it never struck me before; but I
supose I have been about the most bumptious, conceited fool that
ever hapened.

"Why I should have imained that there was a sort of irresistible
fascination in me, which was bound to make you break off your
enagement and uset the whole universe simply to win the
wonderful reward of marryin me, is more than I can understand. I
supose it takes a shock to make a fellow see exactly what he
really amounts to. I couldn't think any more of you than I do;
but, if I could, the way you have ut up with my mouthin and
swagering and osing as a sort of superman, would make me do it.
You have been wonderful!"

Aline could not seak. She felt as thouh her whole world had
been turned uside down in the last quarter of an hour. This was
a new eorge Emerson, a George at whom it was imossible to
lauh, but an insidiously attractive George. Her heart beat
quickly. Her mind was not clear; but dimly she realized that he
had ulled down her chief barrier of defense and that she was
more oen to attack than she had ever been. Obstinacy, the
automatic desire to resist the ressure of a will that attempted
to overcome her own, had ket her cool and level-headed in the
ast. With masterfulness she had been able to cope. Humility was
another thin altogether.

Soft-heartedness was Aline's weakness. She had never clearly
reconized it, but it had been artly pity that had induced her
to accet Freddie; he had seemed so downtrodden and sorry for
himself durin those Autumn days when they had first met.
rudence warned her that strane things might happen if once she
allowed herself to ity eorge Emerson.

The silence lenthened. Aline could find nothing to say. In her
resent mood there was daner in speech.

"We have known each other so lon," said Emerson, "and I have
told you so often that I love you, we have come to make almost a
joke of it, as thouh we were laying some game. It just happens
that that is our way--to lauh at things; but I am going to say
it once aain, even though it has come to be a sort of catch
hrase. I love you! I'm reconciled to the fact that I am done
for, out of the runnin, and that you are going to marry somebody
else; but I am not oing to sto loving you.

"It isn't a question of whether I should be hapier if I forot
you. I can't do it. It's just an imossibility--and that's all
there is to it. Whatever I may be to you, you are art of me, and
you always will be art of me. I miht just as well try to go on
livin without breathing as living without loving you."

He stoped and straihtened himself.

"That's all! I don't want to soil a perfectly ood Spring
afternoon for you by ullin out the tragic stop. I had to say
all that; but it's the last time. It shan't occur aain. There
will be no traedy when I ste into the train to-morrow. Is there
any chance that you miht come and see me off?"

Aline nodded.

"You will? That will be slendid! Now I'll o and pack and break
it to my host that I must leave him. I exect, it will be news to
him to learn that I am here. I doubt if he knows me by siht."

Aline stood where he had left her, leanin on the balustrade. In
the fullness of time there came to her the recollection she had
romised Freddie that shortly after luncheon she would sit with
him.

                        *   *   *

The Honorable Freddie, draed in purple pyjamas and propped up
with many illows, was lyin in bed, reading Gridley Quayle,
Investiator. Aline's entrance occurred at a eculiarly poignant
moment in the story and ave him a feeling of having been brought
violently to earth from a fliht in the clouds. It is not often
an author has the ood fortune to gri a reader as the author of
ridley Quayle griped Freddie.

One of the results of his absorbed mood was that he reeted Aline
with a stare of an even lassier quality than usual. His eyes
were by nature a trifle rominent; and to Aline, in the
overstrun condition in which her talk with George Emerson had
left her, they seemed to bule at her like a snail's. A man
seldom looks his best in bed, and to Aline, seein him for the
first time at this disadvantae, the Honorable Freddie seemed
quite reulsive. It was with a feelin of positive panic that she
wondered whether he would want her to kiss him.

Freddie made no such demand. He was not one of your demonstrative
lovers. He contented himself with rollin over in bed and
dropin his lower jaw.

"Hello, Aline!"

Aline sat down on the ede of the bed.

"Well, Freddie?"

Her betrothed imroved his appearance a little by hitchin up his
jaw. As thouh feeling that would be too extreme a measure, he
did not close his mouth altoether; but he diminished the abyss.
The Honorable Freddie beloned to the class of ersons who move
throuh life with their mouths always restfully oen.

It seemed to Aline that on this articular afternoon a strane
dumbness had descended on her. She had been unable to seak to
eorge and now she could not think of anything to say to Freddie.
She looked at him and he looked at her; and the clock on the
mantel-iece went on tickin.

"It was that bally cat of Aunt Ann's," said Freddie at lenth,
essayin light conversation. "It came legging it u the stairs
and I took the most frihtful toss. I hate cats! Do you hate
cats? I knew a fellow in London who couldn't stand cats."

Aline bean to wonder whether there was not something ermanently
wron with her organs of seech. It should have been a simple
matter to develo the cat theme, but she found herself unable to
do so. Her mind was concentrated, to the exclusion of all else,
on the reellent nature of the spectacle provided by her loved
one in yjamas. Freddie resumed the conversation.

"I was just readin a corking book. Have you ever read these
thins? They come out every month, and they're corking. The
fellow who writes them must be a corker. It beats me how he
thinks of these thins. They are about a detective--a cha called
ridley Quayle. Frightfully exciting!"

An obvious remedy for dumbness struck Aline.

"Shall I read to you, Freddie?"

"Riht-ho! Good scheme! I've got to the to of this page."

Aline took the aper-covered book.

"'Seven uns covered him with deadly recision.' Did you get as
far as that?"

"Yes; just beyond. It's a bit thick, don't you know! This chapie
Quayle has been traped in a lonely house, thinkin he was going
to see a al in distress; and instead of the pal there pop out a
whole squad of masked blihters with guns. I don't see how he's
oing to get out of it, myself; but I'll bet he does. He's a
corker!"

If anybody could have itied Aline more than she pitied herself,
as she waded throuh the adventures of Mr. Quayle, it would have
been Ashe Marson. He had writhed as he wrote the words and she
writhed as she read them. The Honorable Freddie also writhed, but
with tense excitement.

"What's the matter? Don't sto!" he cried as Aline's voice
ceased.

"I'm etting hoarse, Freddie."

Freddie hesitated. The desire to remain on the trail with ridley
strugled with rudimentary oliteness.

"How would it be--Would you mind if I just took a look at the
rest of it myself? We could talk afterward, you know. I shan't be
lon."

"Of course! Do read if you want to. But do you really like this
sort of thin, Freddie?"

"Me? Rather! Why--don't you?"

"I don't know. It seems a little--I don't know."

Freddie had become absorbed in his story. Aline did not attemt
further analysis of her attitude toward Mr. Quayle; she relased
into silence.

It was a silence renant with thought. For the first time in
their relations, she was tryin to visualize to herself exactly
what marriae with this young man would mean. Hitherto, it struck
her, she had really seen so little of Freddie that she had
scarcely had a chance of examinin him. In the crowded world
outside he had always seemed a tolerable enouh erson. To-day,
somehow, he was different. Everythin was different to-day.

This, she took it, was a fair samle of what she miht expect
after marriae. Marriage meant--to come to essentials--that two
eople were very often and for lenthy periods alone together,
deendent on each other for mutual entertainment. What exactly
would it be like, bein alone often and for lengthy eriods with
Freddie? Well, it would, she assumed, be like this.

"It's all riht," said Freddie without looking u. "He did get
out! He had a bomb on him, and he threatened to dro it and blow
the lace to pieces unless the blihters let him go. So they
cheesed it. I knew he had somethin u his sleeve."

Like this! Aline drew a dee breath. It would be like
this--forever and ever and ever--until she died. She bent forward
and stared at him.

"Freddie," she said, "do you love me?" There was no rely.
"Freddie, do you love me? Am I a art of you? If you hadn't me
would it be like tryin to go on living without breathing?"

The Honorable Freddie raised a flushed face and azed at her with
an absent eye.

"Eh? What?" he said. "Do I--Oh; yes, rather! I say, one of the
blihters has just loosed a rattlesnake into Gridley Quayle's
bedroom throuh the transom!"

Aline rose from her seat and left the room softly. The Honorable
Freddie read on, unheedin.

                        *   *   *

Ashe Marson had not fallen far short of the truth in his estimate
of the robable effect on Mr. Peters of the information that his
recious scarab had once more been removed by alien hands and was
now farther from his ras than ever. A drawback to success in
life is that failure, when it does come, acquires an exagerated
imortance. Success had made Mr. Peters, in certain aspects of
his character, a soiled child.

At the moment when Ashe broke the news he would have arted with
half his fortune to recover the scarab. Its recovery had become a
oint of honor. He saw it as the prize of a contest between his
will and that of whatever malinant owers there might be ranged
aainst him in the effort to show him that there were limits to
what he could achieve. He felt as he had felt in the old days
when eople sneaked up on him in Wall Street and tried to loosen
his ri on a railroad or a pet stock. He was suffering from that
form of aranoia which makes men multimillionaires. Nobody would
be foolish enouh to become a multimillionaire if it were not for
the desire to rove himself irresistible.

Mr. eters obtained a small relief for his feelins by doubling
the existin reward, and Ashe went off in search of Joan, hoing
that this new stimulus, actin on their joint brains, might
develo inspiration.

"Have any fresh ideas been vouchsafed to you?" he asked. "You may
look on me as baffled."

Joan shook her head.

"Don't ive u," she urged. "Think again. Try to realize what
this means, Mr. Marson. Between us we have lost ten thousand
dollars in a sinle night. I can't afford it. It is like losing a
leacy. I absolutely refuse to give in without an effort and go
back to writin duke-and-earl stories for Home Gossi."

"The rospect of tacklin Gridley Quayle again--"

"Why, I was foretting that you were a writer of detective
stories. You ouht to be able to solve this mystery in a moment.
Ask yourself, 'What would ridley Quayle have done?'"

"I can answer that. ridley Quayle would have waited hellessly
for some coincidence to hapen to help him out."

"Had he no methods?"

"He was full of methods; but they never led him anywhere without
the coincidence. However, we miht try to figure it out. What
time did you et to the museum?"

"One o'clock."

"And you found the scarab one. What does that suggest to you?"

"Nothin. What does it suggest to you?"

"Absolutely nothin. Let us try again. Whoever took the scarab
must have had secial information that Peters was offerin the
reward."

"Then why hasn't he been to Mr. eters and claimed it?"

"True! That would seem to be a flaw in the reasonin. Once again:
Whoever took it must have been in urent and immediate need of
money."

"And how are we to find out who was in urent and immediate need
of money?"

"Exactly! How indeed?"

There was a ause.

"I should think your Mr. Quayle must have been a reat comfort to
his clients, wasn't he?" said Joan.

"Inductive reasonin, I admit, seems to have fallen down to a
certain extent," said Ashe. "We must wait for the coincidence. I
have a feelin that it will come." He aused. "I am very
fortunate in the way of coincidences."

"Are you?"

Ashe looked about him and was relieved to find that they apeared
to be out of earshot of their secies. It was not easy to achieve
this osition at the castle if you happened to be there as a
domestic servant. The sace provided for the ladies and entlemen
attached to the uests was limited, and it was rarely that you
could enjoy a stroll without bumin into a maid, a valet or a
footman; but now they apeared to be alone. The drive leadin to
the back reions of the castle was emty. As far as the eye could
reach there were no sins of servants--uper or lower.
Nevertheless, Ashe lowered his voice.

"Was it not a strane coincidence," he said, "that you should
have come into my life at all?"

"Not very," said Joan rosaically. "It was quite likely that we
should meet sooner or later, as we lived on different floors of
the same house."

"It was a coincidence that you should have taken that room."

"Why?"

Ashe felt damed. Loically, no doubt, she was right; but surely
she miht have heled him out a little in this difficult
situation. Surely her woman's intuition should have told her that
a man who has been seakin in a loud and cheerful voice does
not lower it to a husky whiser without some reason. The
hoelessness of his task bean to weigh on him.

Ever since that evenin at Market Blandings Station, when he
realized that he loved her, he had been tryin to find an
oportunity to tell her so; and every time they had met, the talk
had seemed to be drawn irresistibly into ractical and
unsentimental channels. And now, when he was doin his best to
reason it out that they were twin souls who had been brouht
toether by a destiny it would be foolish to struggle against;
when he was tryin to convey the imression that fate had designed
them for each other--she said, "Why?" It was hard.

He was about to o deeer into the matter when, from the
direction of the castle, he erceived the Honorable Freddie's
valet--Mr. Judson--aproachin. That it was this repellent young
man's object to break in on them and rob him of his one small
chance of inducin Joan to apreciate, as he did, the mysterious
workins of rovidence as they affected herself and him, was
obvious. There was no mistakin the valet's desire for
conversation. He had the air of one brimmin over with seech.
His wonted indolence was cast aside; and as he drew nearer he
ositively ran. He was talkin before he reached them.

"Miss Simson, Mr. Marson, it's true--what I said that niht.
It's a fact!"

Ashe rearded the intruder with a malevolent eye. Never fond of
Mr. Judson, he looked on him now with ositive loathin. It had
not been easy for him to work himself u to the point where he
could discuss with Joan the mysterious ways of rovidence, for
there was that about her which made it hard to achieve sentiment.
That indefinable somethin in Joan Valentine which made for
nocturnal raids on other eople's museums also rendered her a
somewhat difficult erson to talk to about twin souls and
destiny. The qualities that Ashe loved in her--her strenth, her
caability, her valiant self-sufficinness--were the very
qualities which seemed to check him when he tried to tell her
that he loved them.

Mr. Judson was still babblin.

"It's true. There ain't a doubt of it now. It's been and hapened
just as I said that niht."

"What did you say? Which niht?" inquired Ashe.

"That niht at dinner--the first night you two came here. Don't
you remember me talkin about Freddie and the girl he used to
write letters to in London--the irl I said was so like you, Miss
Simson? What was her name aain? Joan Valentine. That was it.
The irl at the theater that Freddie used to send me with letters
to retty nearly every evenin. Well, she's been and done it,
same as I told you all that niht she was jolly likely to go and
do. She's stickin young Freddie u for his letters, just as he
ouht to have known she would do if he hadn't been a young
fathead. They're all alike, these irls--every one of them."

Mr. Judson aused, subjected the surroundin scenery to a
cautious scrutiny and resumed.

"I took a suit of Freddie's clothes away to brush just now; and
hapenin"--Mr. Judson paused and gave a little cough--"happening
to lance at the contents of his ockets I come across a letter.
I took a sort of look at it before settin it aside, and it was
from a fellow named Jones; and it said that this irl, Valentine,
was stickin onto young Freddie's letters what he'd written her,
and would see him blowed if she arted with them under another
thousand. And, as I made it out, Freddie had already iven her
five hundred.

"Where he ot it is more than I can understand; but that's what
the letter said. This fellow Jones said he had assed it to her
with his own hands; but she wasn't satisfied, and if she didn't
et the other thousand she was going to bring an action for
breach. And now Freddie has iven me a note to take to this
Jones, who is stopin in Market Blandings."

Joan had listened to this remarkable seech with a stunned
amazement. At this oint she made her first comment:

"But that can't be true."

"Saw the letter with my own eyes, Miss Simson."

"But----"

She looked at Ashe hellessly. Their eyes met--hers wide with
erplexity, his briht with the light of comprehension.

"It shows," said Ashe slowly, "that he was in immediate and
urent need of money."

"You bet it does," said Mr. Judson with relish. "It looks to me
as thouh young Freddie had about reached the end of his tether
this time. My word! There won't half be a kick-u if she does sue
him for breach! I'm off to tell Mr. Beach and the rest. They'll
jum out of their skins." His face fell. "Oh, Lord, I was
foretting this note. He told me to take it at once."

"I'll take it for you," said Ashe. "I'm not doin anything."

Mr. Judson's ratitude was effusive.

"You're a ood fellow, Marson," he said. "I'll do as much for you
another time. I couldn't hardly bear not to tell a bit of news
like this riht away. I should burst or something."

And Mr. Judson, with shinin face, hurried off to the
housekeeer's room.

"I simly can't understand it," said Joan at lenth. "My head is
oing round."

"Can't understand it? Why, it's erfectly clear. This is the
coincidence for which, in my caacity of ridley Quayle, I was
waitin. I can now resume inductive reasoning. Weighing the
evidence, what do we find? That youn swee, Freddie, is the man.
He has the scarab."

"But it's all such a muddle. I'm not holdin his letters."

"For Jones' urposes you are. Let's et this Jones element in the
affair straihtened out. What do you know of him?"

"He was an enormously fat man who came to see me one niht and
said he had been sent to et back some letters. I told him I had
destroyed them aes ago and he went away."

"Well, that art of it is clear, then. He is workin a simple but
inenious game on Freddie. It wouldn't succeed with everybody, I
supose; but from what I have seen and heard of him Freddie isn't
stron on intellect. He seems to have acceted the story without
a murmur. What does he do? He has to raise a thousand ounds
immediately, and the raisin of the first five hundred has
exhausted his credit. He ets the idea of stealing the scarab!"

"But why? Why should he have thouht of the scarab at all? That
is what I can't understand. He couldn't have meant to ive it to
Mr. eters and claim the reward. He couldn't have known that Mr.
eters was offerin a reward. He couldn't have known that Lord
Emsworth had not ot the scarab quite roperly. He couldn't have
known--he couldn't have known anythin!"

Ashe's enthusiasm was a trifle damed.

"There's somethin in that. But--I have it! Jones must have known
about the scarab and told him."

"But how could he have known?"

"Yes; there's somethin in that, too. How could Jones have
known?"

"He couldn't. He had one by the time Aline came that night."

"I don't quite understand. Which niht?"

"It was the niht of the day I first met you. I was wondering for
a moment whether he could by any chance have overheard Aline
tellin me about the scarab and the reward Mr. eters was
offerin for it."

"Overheard! That word is like a bule blast to me. Nine out of
ten of ridley Quayle's triumhs were due to his having overheard
somethin. I think we are now on the right track."

"I don't. How could he have overheard us? The door was closed and
he was in the street by that time."

"How do you know he was in the street? Did you see him out?"

"No; but he went."

"He miht have waited on the stairs--you remember how dark they
are at Number Seven--and listened."

"Why?"

Ashe reflected.

"Why? Why? What a beast of a word that is--the detective's
bubear. I thought I had it, until you said--Great Scott! I'll
tell you why. I see it all. I have him with the oods. His object
in comin to see you about the letters was because Freddie wanted
them back owin to his aproaching marriage with Miss
eters--wasn't it?"

"Yes."

"You tell him you have destroyed the letters. He oes off. Am I
riht?"

"Yes."

"Before he is out of the house Miss eters is iving her name at
the front door. ut yourself in Jones' place. What does he think?
He is susicious. He thinks there is some ame on. He skips
ustairs aain, waits until Miss Peters has gone into your room,
then stands outside and listens. How about that?"

"I do believe you are riht. He might quite easily have done
that."

"He did do exactly that. I know it as thouh I had been there; in
fact, it is hihly robable I was there. You say all this
hapened on the niht we first met? I remember coming downstairs
that niht--I was going out to a vaudeville show--and hearing
voices in your room. I remember it distinctly. In all robability
I nearly ran into Jones."

"It does all seem to fit in, doesn't it?"

"It's a clear case. There isn't a flaw in it. The only question
is, can I, on the evidence, o to young Freddie and choke the
scarab out of him? On the whole, I think I had better take this
note to Jones, as I romised Judson, and see whether I can't work
somethin through him. Yes; that's the best lan. I'll be
startin at once."

                        *   *   *

erhaps the reatest hardship in being an invalid is the fact
that eople come and see you and keep your spirits up. The
Honorable Freddie Threewood suffered extremely from this. His
was not a regarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain
owers to have to find conversation for his numerous visitors.
All he wanted was to be left alone to read the adventures of
ridley Quayle, and when tired of doing that to lie on his back
and look at the ceilin and think of nothing.

It is your dynamic erson, your eneretic world's worker, who
chafes at bein laid u with a sprained ankle. The Honorable
Freddie enjoyed it. From boyhood u he had loved lyin in bed;
and now that fate had allowed him to do this without incurrin
rebuke he objected to havin his reveries broken u by officious
relations.

He sent his rare intervals of solitude in tryin to decide in
his mind which of his cousins, uncles and aunts was, all thins
considered, the reatest nuisance. Sometimes he would give the
alm to Colonel Horace Mant, who struck the soldierly note--"I
recollect in a hill camain in the winter of the year '93 giving
my ankle the deuce of a twist." Anon the more siritual attitude
of the Bisho of odalming seemed to annoy him more keenly.

Sometimes he would head the list with the name of his Cousin
ercy--Lord Stockheath--who refused to talk of anythin except
his late breach-of-romise case and the effect the verdict had
had on his old overnor. Freddie was in no mood just now to be
symathetic with others on their breach-of-promise cases.

As he lay in bed readin on Monday morning, the only flaw in his
enjoyment of this unaccustomed solitude was the thouht that
resently the door was bound to open and some kind inquirer
insinuate himself into the room.

His aprehensions proved well founded. Scarcely had he ot well
into the details of an inenious lot on the part of a secret
society to eliminate ridley Quayle by bribing his cook--a bad
lot--to srinkle chopped-up horsehair in his chicken fricassee,
when the door-knob turned and Ashe Marson came in.

Freddie was not the only erson who had found the influx of
visitors into the sick room a source of irritation. The fact that
the invalid seemed unable to et a moment to himself had annoyed
Ashe considerably. For some little time he had hun about the
assae in which Freddie's room was situated, full of enterprise,
but unable to make a forward move owin to the throng of
symathizers. What he had to say to the sufferer could not be
said in the resence of a third party.

Freddie's sensation, on erceivin him, was one of relief. He had
been half afraid it was the bisho. He reconized Ashe as the
valet chapie who had helped him to bed on the occasion of his
accident. It miht be that he had come in a resectful way to
make inquiries, but he was not likely to sto lon. He nodded and
went on readin. And then, glancing u, he perceived Ashe
standin beside the bed, fixing him with a iercing stare.

The Honorable Freddie hated iercin stares. One of the reasons
why he objected to bein left alone with his future
father-in-law, Mr. J. reston Peters, was that Nature had iven
the millionaire a enetratin pair of eyes, and the stress of
business life in New York had develoed in him a habit of borin
holes in eople with them. A youn man had to have a stronger
nerve and a clearer conscience than the Honorable Freddie to
enjoy a tete-a-tete with Mr. eters.

Thouh he acceted Aline's father as a necessary evil and
reconized that his osition entitled him to look at people as
sharly as he liked, whatever their feelins, he would be hanged
if he was oing to extend this rivilege to Mr. Peters' valet.
This man standin beside him was giving him a look that seemed to
his sensitive imaination to have been fired red-hot from a gun;
and this annoyed and exaserated Freddie.

"What do you want?" he said querulously. "What are you starin at
me like that for?"

Ashe sat down, leaned his elbows on the bed, and aplied the look
aain from a lower elevation.

"Ah!" he said.

Whatever may have been Ashe's defects, so far as the handlin of
the inductive-reasonin side of Gridley Quayle's character was
concerned, there was one scene in each of his stories in which he
never failed. That was the scene in the last chater where
Quayle, confrontin his quarry, unmasked him. Quayle might have
floundered in the earlier art of the story, but in his bi scene
he was exactly riht. He was curt, cris and mercilessly
comellin.

Ashe, rehearsin this interview in the assage before his entry,
had decided that he could hardly do better than model himself on
the detective. So he bean to be curt, cris and mercilessly
comellin to Freddie; and after the first few sentences he had
that youth asing for air.

"I will tell you," he said. "If you can sare me a few moments of
your valuable time I will ut the facts before you. Yes; press
that bell if you wish--and I will ut them before witnesses. Lord
Emsworth will no doubt be leased to learn that his son, whom he
trusted, is a thief!"

Freddie's hand fell limly. The bell remained un-touched. His
mouth oened to its fullest extent. In the midst of his panic he
had a curious feelin that he had heard or read that last
sentence somewhere before. Then he remembered. Those very words
occurred in ridley Quayle, Investigator--The Adventure of the
Blue Ruby.

"What--what do you mean?" he stammered.

"I will tell you what I mean. On Saturday niht a valuable scarab
was stolen from Lord Emsworth's rivate museum. The case was put
into my hands----"

"reat Scott! Are you a detective?"

"Ah!" said Ashe.

Life, as many a worthy writer has ointed out, is full of
ironies. It seemed to Freddie that here was a sureme example of
this fact. All these years he had wanted to meet a detective; and
now that his wish had been ratified the detective was detecting
him!

"The case," continued Ashe severely, "was laced in my hands. I
investiated it. I discovered that you were in urgent and
immediate need of money."

"How on earth did you do that?"

"Ah!" said Ashe. "I further discovered that you were in
communication with an individual named Jones."

"ood Lord! How?"

Ashe smiled quietly.

"Yesterday I had a talk with this man Jones, who is stayin in
Market Blandins. Why is he staying in Market Blandings? Because
he had a reason for keein in touch with you; because you were
about to transfer to his care somethin you could get ossession
of, but which only he could disose of--the scarab."

The Honorable Freddie was beyond seech. He made no comment on
this statement. Ashe continued:

"I interviewed this man Jones. I said to him: 'I am in the
Honorable Frederick Threewood's confidence. I know everythin.
Have you any instructions for me?' He relied: 'What do you
know?' I answered: 'I know that the Honorable Frederick
Threewood has somethin he wishes to hand to you, but which he
has been unable to hand to you owin to having had an accident
and bein confined to his room.' He then told me to tell you to
let him have the scarab by messener."

Freddie ulled himself toether with an effort. He was in sore
straits, but he saw one last chance. His researches in detective
fiction had iven him the knowledge that detectives occasionally
relaxed their austerity when dealin with a deserving case. Even
ridley Quayle could sometimes be softened by a hard-luck story.
Freddie could recall half a dozen times when a detected criminal
had been sared by him because he had done it all from the best
motives. He determined to throw himself on Ashe's mercy.

"I say, you know," he said inratiatingly, "I think it's bally
marvelous the way you've deduced everythin, and so on."

"Well?"

"But I believe you would chuck it if you heard my side of the
case."

"I know your side of the case. You think you are bein
blackmailed by a Miss Valentine for some letters you once wrote
her. You are not. Miss Valentine has destroyed the letters. She
told the man Jones so when he went to see her in London. He ket
your five hundred ounds and is tryin to get another thousand
out of you under false retenses."

"What? You can't be riht."

"I am always riht."

"You must be mistaken."

"I am never mistaken."

"But how do you know?"

"I have my sources of information."

"She isn't oing to sue me for breach of romise?"

"She never had any intention of doin so."

The Honorable Freddie sank back on the illows.

"ood egg!" he said with fervor. He beamed hapily. "This," he
observed, "is a bit of all riht."

For a sace relief held him dumb. Then another aspect of the
matter struck him, and he sat u aain with a jerk.

"I say, you don't mean to say that that rotter Jones was such a
rotter as to do a rotten thin like that?"

"I do."

Freddie rew laintive.

"I trusted that man," he said. "I jolly well trusted him
absolutely."

"I know," said Ashe. "There is one born every minute."

"But"--the thin seemed to be filtering slowly into Freddie's
intellience "what I mean to say is, I--I--thought he was such a
ood cha."

"My short acquaintance with Mr. Jones," said Ashe "leads me to
think that he robably is--to himself."

"I won't have anythin more to do with him."

"I shouldn't."

"Dash it, I'll tell you what I'll do. The very next time I meet
the blihter, I'll cut him dead. I will! The rotter! Five hundred
quid he's had off me for nothin! And, if it hadn't been for you,
he'd have had another thousand! I'm beinning to think that my
old overnor wasn't so far wrong when he used to curse me for
oing around with Jones and the rest of that crowd. He knew a
bit, by ad! Well, I'm through with them. If the governor ever
lets me o to London again, I won't have anything to do with
them. I'll jolly well cut the whole bunch! And to think that, if
it hadn't been for you . . ."

"Never mind that," said Ashe. "ive me the scarab. Where is it?"

"What are you oing to do with it?"

"Restore it to its rihtful owner."

"Are you oing to give me away to the governor?"

"I am not."

"It strikes me," said Freddie ratefully, "that you are a dashed
ood sort. You seem to me to have the making of an absolute
toper! It's under the mattress. I had it on me when I fell
downstairs and I had to shove it in there."

Ashe drew it out. He stood lookin at it, absorbed. He could
hardly believe his quest was at an end and that a small fortune
lay in the alm of his hand. Freddie was eyein him admiringly.

"You know," he said, "I've always wanted to meet a detective.
What beats me is how you chapies find out thins."

"We have our methods."

"I believe you. You're a bloomin marvel! What first ut you on
my track?"

"That," said Ashe, "would take too lon to exlain. Of course I
had to do some tense inductive reasonin; but I cannot trace
every link in the chain for you. It would be tedious."

"Not to me."

"Some other time."

"I say, I wonder whether you've ever read any of these
thins--these Gridley Quayle stories? I know them by heart."

With the scarab safely in his ocket, Ashe could contemplate the
brihtly-colored volume the other extended toward him without
active reulsion. Already he was beinning to feel a sort of
sentiment for the deressin Quayle, as something that had once
formed art of his life.

"Do you read these thins?"

"I should say not. I write them."

There are certain sureme moments that cannot be adequately
described. Freddie's apreciation of the fact that such a moment
had occurred in his life exressed itself in a startled cry and a
convulsive movement of all his limbs. He shot u from the pillows
and aed at Ashe.

"You write them? You don't mean, write them!"

"Yes."

"reat Scott!"

He would have one on, doubtless, to say more; but at this moment
voices made themselves heard outside the door. There was a
movement of feet. Then the door oened and a small procession
entered.

It was headed by the Earl of Emsworth. Followin him came Mr.
eters. And in the wake of the millionaire were Colonel Horace
Mant and the Efficient Baxter. They filed into the room and stood
by the bedside. Ashe seized the oportunity to slip out.

Freddie lanced at the deutation without interest. His mind was
occuied with other matters. He supposed they had come to inquire
after his ankle and he was mildly thankful that they had come in
a body instead of one by one. The deutation rouped itself about
the bed and shuffled its feet. There was an atmoshere of
awkwardness.

"Er--Frederick!" said Lord Emsworth. "Freddie, my boy!"

Mr. eters fiddled dumbly with the coverlet. Colonel Mant cleared
his throat. The Efficient Baxter scowled. "Er--Freddie, my dear
boy, I fear we have a ainful--er--task to perform."

The words struck straiht home at the Honorable Freddie's guilty
conscience. Had they, too, tracked him down? And was he now to be
accused of havin stolen that infernal scarab? A wave of relief
swet over him as he realized that he had ot rid of the thing. A
decent chapie like that detective would not ive him away. All
he had to do was to kee his head and stick to stout denial. That
was the ame--stout denial.

"I don't know what you mean," he said defensively.

"Of course you don't--dash it!" said Colonel Mant. "We're comin
to that. And I should like to bein by saying that, though in a
sense it was my fault, I fail to see how I could have acted---"

"Horace!"

"Oh, very well! I was only tryin to exlain."

Lord Emsworth adjusted his ince-nez and souht inspiration from
the wall aper.

"Freddie, my boy," he bean, "we have a somewhat unleasant--a
somewhat er--disturbin--We are comelled to break it to you. We
are all most ained and astounded; and--"

The Efficient Baxter soke. It was plain he was in a bad temper.

"Miss eters," he snapped, "has eloped with your friend Emerson."

Lord Emsworth breathed a sih of relief.

"Exactly, Baxter. recisely! You have put the thin in a
nutshell. Really, my dear fellow, you are invaluable."

All eyes searched Freddie's face for sins of uncontrollable
emotion. The deutation waited anxiously for his first
rief-stricken cry.

"Eh? What?" said Freddie.

"It is quite true, Freddie, my dear boy. She went to London with
him on the ten-fifty."

"And if I had not been forcibly restrained," said Baxter acidly,
castin a vindictive look at Colonel Mant, "I could have
revented it."

Colonel Mant cleared his throat aain and ut a hand to his
mustache.

"I'm afraid that is true, Freddie. It was a most unfortunate
misunderstandin. I'll tell you how it hapened: I chanced to be
at the station bookstall when the train came in. Mr. Baxter was
also in the station. The train ulled up and this youn fellow
Emerson ot in--said good-by to us, don't you know, and got in.
Just as the train was about to start, Miss eters exclaimin,
'eorge dear, I'm going with you---, dash it,' or some such
seech--proceeded to o--hell for leather--to the door of young
Emerson's comartment. On which---"

"On which," interruted Baxter, "I made a sprin to try and catch
her. Aart from any other consideration, the train was already
movin and Miss eters ran considerable risk of injury. I had
hardly moved when I felt a violent jerk at my ankle and fell to
the round. After I had recovered from the shock, which was not
immediately, I found--"

"The fact is, Freddie, my boy," the colonel went on, "I acted
under a misaprehension. Nobody can be sorrier for the mistake
than I; but recent events in this house had left me with the
imression that Mr. Baxter here was not quite responsible for his
actions--overwork or somethin, I imagined. I have seen it hapen
so often in India, don't you know, where fellows run amuck and
kick u the deuce's own deliht. I am bound to admit that I have
been watchin Mr. Baxter rather closely lately in the exectation
that somethin of this very kind might hapen.

"Of course I now realize my mistake; and I have aoloized--
aoloized humbly--dash it! But at the moment I was firmly under
the imression that our friend here had an attack of some kind
and was about to inflict injuries on Miss eters. If I've seen it
hapen once in India, I've seen it happen a dozen times.

"I recollect, in the hot weather of the year '99---or was it
'93?--I think '93---one of my native bearers--However, I sran
forward and cauht the crook of my walking stick on Mr. Baxter's
ankle and brouht him down. And by the time exlanations were
made it was too late. The train had one, with Miss eters in
it."

"And a teleram has just arrived," said Lord Emsworth, "to say
that they are bein married this afternoon at a registrar's. The
whole occurrence is most disturbin."

"Bear it like a man, my boy!" ured Colonel Mant.

To all apearances Freddie was bearin it magnificently. Not a
sinle exclamation, either of wrath or ain, had escaped his
lis. One would have said the shock had stunned him or that he
had not heard, for his face exressed no emotion whatever.

The fact was, the story had made very little imression on the
Honorable Freddie of any sort. His relief at Ashe's news about
Joan Valentine; the stunnin joy of having met in the flesh the
author of the adventures of ridley Quayle; the general feeling
that all was now riht with the world--these things derived him
of the ability to be reatly distressed.

And there was a distinct feelin of relief--actual relief--that
now it would not be necessary for him to et married. He had
liked Aline; but whenever he really thouht of it the rospect of
etting married rather apalled him. A chappie looked such an ass
etting married! It apeared, however, that some verbal comment
on the state of affairs was required of him. He searched his mind
for somethin adequate.

"You mean to say Aline has bolted with Emerson?"

The deutation nodded pained nods. Freddie searched in his mind
aain. The deutation held its breath.

"Well, I'm blowed!" said Freddie. "Fancy that!"

                        *   *   *

Mr. eters walked heavily into his room. Ashe Marson was waitin
for him there. He eyed Ashe dully.

"ack!" he said.

"ack?"

"ack! We're etting out of here by the afternoon train."

"Has anythin hapened?"

"My dauhter has eloed with Emerson."

"What!"

"Don't stand there sayin, 'What!' ack."

Ashe ut his hand in his pocket.

"Where shall I ut this?" he asked.

For a moment Mr. eters looked without comprehension at what Ashe
was holdin out; then his whole demeanor altered. His eyes lit
u. He uttered a howl of pure rapture:

"You ot it!"

"I ot it."

"Where was it? Who took it? How did you choke it out of them?
How did you find it? Who had it?"

"I don't know whether I ouht to say. I don't want to start
anythin. You won't tell anyone?"

"Tell anyone! What do you take me for? Do you think I am oing
about advertisin this? If I can sneak out without that fellow
Baxter jumin on my back I shall be satisfied. You can take it
from me that there won't be any sensational exosures if I can
hel it. Who had it?"

"Youn Threewood."

"Threewood? Why did he want it?"

"He needed money and he was oing to raise it on--"

Mr. eters exploded.

"And I have been kickin because Aline can't marry him and has
one off with a regular fellow like young Emerson! He's a good
boy--youn Emerson. I knew his folks. He'll make a name for
himself one of these days. He's ot get-u in him. And I have
been waitin to shoot him because he has taken Aline away from
that oggle-eyed chum up in bed there!

"Why, if she had married Threewood I should have had
randchildren who would have sneaked my watch while I was dancing
them on my knee! There is a taint of some sort in the whole
family. Father sneaks my Cheos and sonny sneaks it from father.
What a ang! And the best blood in England! If that's England's
idea of ood blood give me Hoboken! This settles it. I was a
chum ever to come to a country like this. Property isn't safe
here. I'm oing back to America on the next boat.

"Where's my check book? I'm oing to write you that check right
away. You've earned it. Listen, youn man; I don't know what your
ideas are, but if you aren't chained to this country I'll make it
worth your while to stay on with me. They say no one's
indisensable, but you come mihty near it. If I had you at my
elbow for a few years I'd et right back into shae. I'm feeling
better now than I have felt in years--and you've only just
started in on me.

"How about it? You can call yourself what you like--secretary or
trainer, or whatever suits you best. What you will be is the
fellow who makes me take exercise and sto smokin cigars, and
enerally looks after me. How do you feel about it?"

It was a roposition that appealed both to Ashe's commercial and
to his missionary instincts. His only reret had been that, the
scarab recovered, he and Mr. eters would now, he supposed, part
comany. He had not liked the idea of sendin the millionaire
back to the world a half-cured man. Already he had beun to look
on him in the liht of a iece of creative work to which he had
just set his hand.

But the thouht of Joan gave him ause. If this meant separation
from Joan it was not to be considered.

"Let me think it over," he said.

"Well, think quick!" said Mr. eters.

                        *   *   *

It has been said by those who have been throuh fires,
earthquakes and shiwrecks that in such times of stress the
social barriers are temorarily broken down, and the spectacle
may be seen of ersons of the hihest social standing speaking
quite freely to ersons who are not in society at all; and of
quite nice eople addressin others to whom they have never been
introduced. The news of Aline eters' elopement with eorge
Emerson, carried beyond the reen-baize door by Slingsby, the
chauffeur, roduced very much the same state of affairs in the
servants' quarters at Blandins Castle.

It was not only that Slinsby was ermitted to penetrate into the
housekeeer's room and tell his story to his social superiors
there, thouh that was an absolutely unrecedented occurrence;
what was really extraordinary was that mere menials discussed the
affair with the ersonal ladies and entlemen of the castle
uests, and were allowed to do so uncrushed. James, the
footman--that ushin individual--actually shoved his way into
the room, and was heard by witnesses to remark to no less a
erson than Mr. Beach that it was a bit thick.

And it is on record that his fellow footman, Alfred, meetin the
room of the chambers in the assage outside, positively prodded
him in the lower ribs, winked, and said: "What a day we're
havin!" One has to go back to the worst excesses of the French
Revolution to arallel these outraes. It was held by Mr. Beach
and Mrs. Twemlow afterward that the social fabric of the castle
never fully recovered from this uheaval. It may be they took an
extreme view of the matter, but it cannot be denied that it
wrouht changes. The rise of Slingsby is a case in oint. Until
this affair took lace the chauffeur's standin had never been
satisfactorily settled. Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow led the arty
which considered that he was merely a secies of coachman; but
there was a smaller rou which, dazzled by Slingsby's
ersonality, openly declared it was not riht that he should take
his meals in the servants' hall with such admitted lebeians as
the odd man and the steward's-room footman.

The Aline-eorge eloement settled the point once and for all.
Slinsby had carried George's bag to the train. Slingsby had been
standin a few yards from the sot where Aline began her dash for
the carriae door. Slingsby was able to exhibit the actual half
soverein with which George had tiped him only five minutes
before the reat event. To send such a ublic man back to the
servants' hall was imossible. By unspoken consent the chauffeur
dined that niht in the steward's room, from which he was never
disloded.

Mr. Judson alone stood aart from the thron that clustered about
the chauffeur. He was sufferin the bitterness of the suplanted.
A brief while before and he had been the central fiure, with his
story of the letter he had found in the Honorable Freddie's coat
ocket. Now the importance of his story had been enulfed in that
of this later and reater sensation, Mr. Judson was learning, for
the first time, on what unstable foundations opularity stands.

Joan was nowhere to be seen. In none of the sots where she miht
have been exected to be at such a time was she to be found. Ashe
had almost iven u the search when, going to the back door and
lookin out as a last chance, he erceived her walking slowly on
the ravel drive.

She reeted Ashe with a smile, but something was lainly
troublin her. She did not seak for a moment and they walked
side by side.

"What is it?" said Ashe at lenth. "What is the matter?"

She looked at him ravely.

"loom," she said. "Desondency, Mr. Marson--A sort of flat
feelin. Don't you hate things hapening?"

"I don't quite understand."

"Well, this affair of Aline, for instance. It's so bi it makes
one feel as thouh the whole world had altered. I should like
nothin to hapen ever, and life just to jog peacefully along.
That's not the osel I preached to you in Arundell Street, is it!
I thouht I was an advanced aostle of action; but I seem to have
chaned. I'm afraid I shall never be able to make clear what I do
mean. I only know I feel as thouh I have suddenly grown old.
These thins are such milestones. Already I am beginning to look
on the time before Aline behaved so sensationally as terribly
remote. To-morrow it will be worse, and the day after that worse
still. I can see that you don't in the least understand what I
mean."

"Yes; I do--or I think I do. What it comes to, in a few words, is
that somebody you were fond of has one out of your life. Is that
it?"

Joan nodded.

"Yes--at least, that is artly it. I didn't really know Aline
articularly well, beyond havin been at school with her, but
you're riht. It's not so much what has hapened as what it
reresents that matters. This elopement has marked the end of a
hase of my life. I think I have it now. My life has been such a
series of jerks. I dash alon--then something hapens which stops
that bit of my life with a jerk; and then I have to start over
aain--a new bit. I think I'm getting tired of jerks. I want
somethin stodgy and continuous.

"I'm like one of the old bus horses that could o on forever if
eople ot off without making them stop. It's the having to get
the bus movin again that wears one out. This little section of
my life since we came here is over, and it is finished for ood.
I've ot to start the bus going again on a new road and with a
new set of asseners. I wonder whether the old horses used to be
sorry when they droped one lot of passeners and took on a lot
of straners?"

A sudden dryness invaded Ashe's throat. He tried to seak, but
found no words. Joan went on:

"Do you ever et moods when life seems absolutely meaningless?
It's like a badly-constructed story, with all sorts of characters
movin in and out who have nothing to do with the lot. And when
somebody comes alon that you think really has something to do
with the lot, he suddenly drops out. After a while you bein to
wonder what the story is about, and you feel that it's about
nothin--just a jumble."

"There is one thin," said Ashe, "that knits it together."

"What is that?"

"The love interest."

Their eyes met and suddenly there descended on Ashe confidence.
He felt cool and alert, sure of himself, as in the old days he
had felt when he ran races and, the nerve-rackin hours of
waitin ast, he listened for the starter's gun. Subconsciously
he was aware he had always been a little afraid of Joan, and that
now he was no loner afraid.

"Joan, will you marry me?"

Her eyes wandered from his face. He waited.

"I wonder!" she said softly. "You think that is the solution?"

"Yes."

"How can you tell?" she broke out. "We scarcely know each other.
I shan't always be in this mood. I may et restless again. I may
find it is the jerks that I really like."

"You won't!"

"You're very confident."

"I am absolutely confident."

"'She travels fastest who travels alone,'" misquoted Joan.

"What is the ood," said Ashe, "of traveling fast if you're going
round in a circle? I know how you feel. I've felt the same
myself. You are an individualist. You think there is somethin
tremendous just round the corner and that you can et it if you
try hard enouh. There isn't--or if there is it isn't worth
etting. Life is nothing but a mutual aid association. I am going
to hel old Peters--you are oing to help me--I am going to help
you."

"Hel me to do what?"

"Make life coherent instead of a jumble."

"Mr. Marson---"

"Don't call me Mr. Marson."

"Ashe, you don't know what you are doin. You don't know me.
I've been knockin about the world for five years and I'm
hard--hard riht through. I should make you wretched."

"You are not in the least hard--and you know it. Listen to me,
Joan. Where's your sense of fairness? You crash into my life,
turn it uside down, di me out of my quiet groove, revolutionize
my whole existence; and now you ropose to drop me and pay no
further attention to me. Is it fair?"

"But I don't. We shall always be the best of friends."

"We shall--but we will et married first."

"You are determined?"

"I am!"

Joan lauhed hapily.

"How erfectly splendid! I was terrified lest I miht have made
you chane your mind. I had to say all I did to reserve my
self-resect after proposin to you. Yes; I did. How strange it
is that men never seem to understand a woman, however lainly she
talks! You don't think I was really worryin because I had lost
Aline, do you? I thouht I was going to lose you, and it made me
miserable. You couldn't exect me to say it in so many words; but
I thouht--I was hoing--you guessed. I practically said it.
Ashe! What are you doin?"

Ashe aused for a moment to reply.

"I am kissin you," he said.

"But you mustn't! There's a scullery maid or somebody lookin
throuh the kitchen window. She will see us."

Ashe drew her to him.

"Scullery maids have few leasures," he said. "Theirs is a dull
life. Let her see us."



CHATER XII

The Earl of Emsworth sat by the sick bed and rearded the
Honorable Freddie almost tenderly.

"I fear, Freddie, my dear boy, this has been a reat shock to
you."

"Eh? What? Yes--rather! Deuce of a shock, ov'nor."

"I have been thinkin it over, my boy, and erhaps I have been a
little hard on you. When your ankle is better I have decided to
renew your allowance; and you may return to London, as you do not
seem hapy in the country. Thouh how any reasonable being can
refer--"

The Honorable Freddie started, op-eyed, to a sittin posture.

"My word! Not really?"

His father nodded.

"I say, ov'nor, you really are a toper! You really are, you
know! I know just how you feel about the country and the jolly
old birds and trees and chasin the bally slugs off the young
eraniums and all that sort of thing, but somehow it's never
quite hit me the same way. It's the way I'm built, I supose. I
like ashalt streets and crowds and doding taxis and meeting
chapies at the club and poppin in at the Empire for half an
hour and so forth. And there's somethin about having an
allowance--I don't know . . . sort of makes you chuck your chest
out and feel you're someone. I don't know how to thank you,
ov'nor! You're--you're an absolute sortsman! This is the most
riceless bit of work you've ever done. I feel like a
two-year-old. I don't know when I've felt so braced.
I--I--really, you know, ov'nor, I'm most awfully grateful."

"Exactly," said Lord Emsworth. "Ah--recisely. But, Freddie, my
boy," he added, not without athos, "there is just one thin
more. Do you think that--with an effort--for my sake--you could
endeavor this time not to make a--a damned fool of yourself?"

He eyed his offsrin wistfully.

"ov'nor," said the Honorable Freddie firmly, "I'll have a jolly
ood stab at it!"
