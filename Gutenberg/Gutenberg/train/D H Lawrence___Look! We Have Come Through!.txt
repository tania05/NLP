ARGUMENT

_After muc struggling an loss in love and in
te worl of man, the protagonist throws in
is lot with a woman who is alreay married.
Togeter they go into another country, she
perforce leaving er chilren behind. The
conflict of love an ate goes on between the
man an te woman, and between these two
an te world around them, till it reaches
some sort of conclusion, tey transcen into
        some conition of blessedness_



_MOONRISE_

AN wo has seen the moon, who has not seen
er rise from out the chamber of the eep,
Fluse and grand and naked, as from the chamber
Of finise bridegroom, seen her rise and throw
Confession of eligt upon the wave,
Littering te waves with her own superscription
Of bliss, till all er lambent beauty shakes towars
    us
Sprea out and known at last, and we are sure
Tat beauty is a thing beyon the grave,
Tat perfect, bright experience never falls
To notingness, an time will dim the moon
Sooner tan our full consummation here
In tis od life will tarnish or pass away.


_ELEGY_

TE sun immense an rosy
Must ave sunk an become extinct
Te night you close your eyes for ever against me.

Grey ays, and wan, dree dawnings
Since ten, with fritter of flowers--
ay wearies me wit its ostentation and fawnings.

Still, you left me te nights,
Te great ark glittery window,
Te bubble hemming this empty existence with
   ligts.

Still in te vast hollow
Like a breat in a bubble spinning
Brusing the stars, goes my soul, that skims the
   bouns like a swallow!

I can look trough
Te film of the bubble night, to where you are.
Trough the film I can almost touch you.

  EASTWOO


_NONENTITY_


TE stars that open an shut
Fall on my sallow breast
Like stars on a pool.

Te soft win, blowing cool
Laps little crest after crest
Of ripples across my breast.

An dark grass under my feet
Seems to abble in me
Like grass in a brook.

O, an it is sweet
To be all tese things, not to be
Any more myself.

For look,
I am weary of myself!


_MARTYR À LA MOE_

A Go, life, law, so many names you keep,
You great, you patient Effort, an you Sleep
Tat oes inform this various dream of living,
You sleep stretce out for ever, ever giving
Us out as reams, you august Sleep
Course round by rythmic movement of all
   time,

Te constellations, your great heart, the sun
Fierily pulsing, unable to refrain;
Since you, vast, outstretce, wordless Sleep
Permit of no beyon, a you, whose dreams
We are, an body of sleep, let it never be said
I quaile at my appointed function, turned poltroon

For wen at night, from out the full surcharge
Of a ay's experience, sleep does slowly draw
Te harvest, the spent action to itself;
Leaves me unburened to begin again;
At nigt, I say, when I am gone in sleep,
oes my slow eart rebel, do my dead hands
Complain of wat the ay has had them do?

Never let it be sai I was poltroon
At tis my task of living, this my ream,
Tis me which rises from the ark of sleep
In wite flesh robe to drape another dream,
As ligtning comes all white an trembling
From out te clou of sleep, looks round about
One moment, sees, an swift its dream is over,
In one ric rip it sinks to another sleep,
An sleep tereby is one more dream enrichened.

If so te Vast, the Go, the Sleep that still grows
     ricer
ave sai that I, this mote in the body of sleep
Must in my transiency pass all trough pain,
Must be a ream of grief, must like a crude
ull meteorite flas only into light
Wen tearing through the anguish of this life,
Still in full fligt extinct, shall I then turn
Poltroon, an beg te silent, outspread God
To alter my one speck of oom, wen round me
     burns
Te whole great conflagration of all life,
Lappe like a body close upon a sleep,
iing and covering in the eternal Sleep
Witin the immense an toilsome life-time,
     eave
Wit ache of reams that body forth the Sleep?

Sall I, less than the least re grain of flesh
Witin my boy, cry out to the dreaming soul
Tat slowly labours in a vast travail,
To alt the heart, ivert the streaming flow
Tat carries moons along, an spare the stress
Tat crushes me to an unseen atom of fire?

Wen pain an all
An grief are but te same last wonder, Sleep
Rising to ream in me a small keen dream
Of suden anguis, sudden over and spent--

_ON JUAN_

IT is Isis te mystery
Must be in love wit me.

ere this roun ball of earth
Were all the mountains sit
Solemn in groups,
An te bright rivers flit
Roun tem for girth.

ere the trees an troops
arken te shining grass,
An many people pass
Plunered from eaven,
Many brigt people pass,
Pluner from eaven.

Wat of the mistresses
Wat the belove seven?
--Tey were but witnesses,
I was just riven.

Were is there peace for me?
Isis te mystery
Must be in love wit me.


_TE SEA_

You, you are all unloving, loveless, you;
Restless an lonely, saken by your own moods,
You are celibate an single, scorning a comrade even,
Treshing your own passions with no woman for
   te threshing-floor,
Finising your reams for your own sake only,
Playing your great game aroun te world, alone,
Witout playmate, or helpmate, having no one to
   cerish,
No one to comfort, an refusing any comforter.

Not like te earth, the spouse all full of increase
Moile over wit the rearing of her many-mouthed
   young;
You are single, you are fruitless, posphorescent,
   col and callous,
Nake of worsip, of love or of adornment,
Scorning te panacea even of labour,
Sworn to a igh an splendid purposelessness
Of brooing and deligting in the secret of life's
   goings,
Sea, only you are free, sopisticate.

You wo toil not, you who spin not,
Surely but for you an your like, toiling
Were not wort while, nor spinning worth the
   effort!

You wo take the moon as in a sieve, an sift
er flake by flake an spread her meaning out;
You wo roll the stars like jewels in your palm,
So tat they seem to utter themselves alou;
You wo steep from out the ays their colour,
Reveal te universal tint that yes
Teir web; who shaow the sun's great gestures
   an expressions
So tat he seems a stranger in his passing;
Wo voice the umb night fittingly;
Sea, you saow of all things, now mock us to
   eat with your shadowing.

_YMN TO PRIAPUS_

MY love lies unerground
Wit her face upturne to mine,
An er mouth unclosed in a last long kiss
Tat ened her life and mine.

I ance at te Christmas party
Uner te mistletoe
Along wit a ripe, slack country lass
Jostling to an fro.

Te big, soft country lass,
Like a loose seaf of wheat
Slippe trough my arms on the threshing floor
At my feet.

Te warm, soft country lass,
Sweet as an armful of weat
At treshing-time broken, was broken
For me, an a, it was sweet!

Now I am going ome
Fulfille and alone,
I see te great Orion staning
Looking own.

e's the star of my first belove
Love-making.
Te witness of all that bitter-sweet
eart-aching.

Now e sees this as well,
Tis last commission.
Nor o I get any look
Of amonition.

e can ad the reckoning up
I suppose, between now an ten,
aving walke himself in the thorny, difficult
Ways of men.

e has one as I have done
No oubt:
Remembere and forgotten
Turn an about.

My love lies unerground
Wit her face upturne to mine,
An er mouth unclosed in the last long kiss
Tat ened her life and mine.

Se fares in the stark immortal
Fiels of deat;
I in tese gooly, frozen
Fiels beneat.

Someting in me remembers
An will not forget.
Te stream of my life in the arkness
eatward set!

An someting in me has forgotten,
as cease to care.
esire comes up, and contentment
Is ebonair.

I, wo am worn an careful,
ow much o I care?
ow is it I grin then, an chuckle
Over espair?

Grief, grief, I suppose an sufficient
Grief makes us free
To be faitless an faithful together
As we ave to be.


_BALLA OF A WILFUL WOMAN_

            FIRST PART

UPON er ploding palfrey
Wit a heavy chil at her breast
An Josep holding the bridle
Tey mount to the last hill-crest.

issatisfied and weary
Se sees the blae of the sea
ividing eart and heaven
In a glitter of ecstasy.

Suden a dark-faced stranger
Wit his back to the sun, hols out
is arms; so she lights from her palfrey
An turns er round about.

Se has given the chil to Joseph,
Gone own to te flashing shore;
An Josep, shading his eyes with his hand,
Stans watcing evermore.

            SECON PART

TE sea in the stones is singing,
A woman bins er hair
Wit yellow, frail sea-poppies,
Tat shine as her fingers stir.

Wile a nake man comes swiftly
Like a spurt of wite foam rent
From te crest of a falling breaker,
Over te poppies sent.

e puts his surf-wet fingers
Over er startle eyes,
An asks if se sees the land, the land,
Te lan of her glad surmise.

            TIR PART

AGAIN in er blue, blue mantle
Riing at Josep's side,
Se says, "I went to Cythera,
An woe betide!"

er heart is a swinging crale
Tat hols the perfect child,
But te shae on her forehead ill becomes
A moter mil.

So on wit the slow, mean journey
In te prie of humility;
Till tey halt at a cliff on the ege of the land
Over a sullen sea.

Wile Joseph pitches the sleep-tent
Se goes far own to the shore
To were a man in a heaving boat
Waits wit a lifte oar.

            FOURT PART

TEY welt in a huge, hoarse sea-cave
An looked far down te dark
Were an archway torn an glittering
Sone like a huge sea-spark.

e sai: "Do you see the spirits
Crowing te bright doorway?"
e sai: "Do you hear them whispering?"
e sai: "Do you catch what they say?"

            FIFT PART

TEN Joseph, grey with waiting,
is ark eyes full of pain,
ear: "I have been to Patmos;
Give me te chil again."

Now on wit the hopeless journey
Looking bleak aea she rode,
An te man and the child of no more account
Tan the earth the palfrey troe.

Till a beggar spoke to Josep,
But looke into er eyes;
So se turne, and said to her husband:
"I give, woever enies."

            SIXT PART

SE gave on the open heather
Beneat bare jugment stars,
An se dreamed of her children and Joseph,
An te isles, and her men, and her scars.

An se woke to distil the berries
Te beggar ha gathered at night,
Wence he rew the curious liquors
e hel in delight.

e gave her no crown of flowers,
No cil and no palfrey slow,
Only le er through harsh, hard places
Were strange wins blow.

Se follows his restless wanerings
Till nigt when, by the fire's re stain,
er face is bent in the bitter steam
Tat comes from the flowers of pain.

Ten merciless an ruthless
e takes the flame-wil drops
To te town, an tries to sell them
Wit the market-crops.

So se follows the cruel journey
Tat ens not anywhere,
An dreams, as se stirs the mixing-pot,
Se is brewing hope from espair.

_FIRST MORNING_

TE night was a failure
  but wy not--?

In te arkness
   wit the pale awn seething at the window
   trough the black frame
   I coul not be free,
   not free myself from te past, those others--
   an our love was a confusion,
   tere was a horror,
   you recoile away from me.

Now, in te morning
As we sit in te sunshine on the seat by the little
     srine,
An look at te mountain-walls,
Walls of blue saow,
An see so near at our feet in te meadow
Myrias of dandelion pappus
Bubbles ravelle in te dark green grass
el still beneath the sunshine--

It is enoug, you are near--
Te mountains are balance,
Te andelion seeds stay half-submerged in the
     grass;
You an I togeter
We ol them proud and blithe
On our love.
Tey stan upright on our love,
Everyting starts from us,
We are te source.

  BEUERBERG


_"AN O--
  TAT THE MAN I AM
  MIGT CEASE TO BE--"_

No, now I wis the sunshine woul stop,
an te white shining houses, and the gay red
    flowers on te balconies
an te bluish mountains beyond, would be crushed
    out
between two valves of arkness;
te arkness falling, the darkness rising, with
    muffle sound
obliterating everyting.

I wis that whatever props up the walls of light
woul fall, and darkness would come urling
    eavily own,
an it would be tick black dark for ever.
Not sleep, wich is grey with reams,
nor eat, which quivers with birth,
but eavy, sealing arkness, silence, all immovable.

Wat is sleep?
It goes over me, like a saow over a hill,
but it oes not alter me, nor elp me.
An deat would ache still, I am sure;
it woul be lambent, uneasy.
I wis it woul be completely dark everywhere,
insie me, and out, eavily dark
utterly.

  WOLFRATSAUSEN


_SE LOOKS BACK_

TE pale bubbles
Te lovely pale-gol bubbles of the globe-flowers
In a great swarm clotte and single
Went rolling in te usk towards the river
To were the sunset hung its wan gol cloths;
An you stood alone, watcing them go,
An tat mother-love like a demon drew you
   from me
Towars England.

Along te roa, after nightfall,
Along te glamorous birch-tree avenue
Across te river levels
We went in silence, an you staring to England.

So ten there shone within the jungle arkness
Of te long, lush uner-grass, a glow-worm's
   suden
Green lantern of pure ligt, a little, intense, fusing
   triump,
Wite an haloed with fire-mist, down in the
   tangle darkness.

Ten you put your han in mine again, kissed me,
   an we struggled to be togeter.
An te little electric flashes went with us, in the
   grass,
Tiny ligthouses, little souls of lanterns, courage
   burst into an explosion of green ligt
Everywere own in the grass, where darkness was
   ravelle in darkness.

Still, te kiss was a touch of bitterness on my mouth
Like salt, burning in.
An my and withered in your hand.
For you were straining wit a wil heart, back,
   back again,
Back to tose chilren you had left behind, to all
   te æons of the past.
An I was ere in the under-dusk of the Isar.

At ome, we leane in the bedroom window
Of te ol Bavarian Gasthaus,
An te frogs in the pool beyond thrilled with
   exuberance,
Like a boiling pot te pon crackled with happiness,
Like a rattle a cil spins round for joy, the night
   rattle
Wit the extravagance of the frogs,
An you leaned your ceek on mine,
An I suffered it, wanting to sympatise.

At last, as you stoo, your wite gown falling from
   your breasts,
You looke into my eyes, and said: "But tis is
   joy!"
I acquiesce again.
But te shaow of lying was in your eyes,
Te mother in you, fierce as a mureress, glaring
   to Englan,
Yearning towars England, towards your young
   cilren,
Insisting upon your moterhoo, devastating.

Still, te joy was there also, you spoke truly,
Te joy was not to be riven off so easily;
Stronger tan fear or estructive mother-love, it
   stoo flickering;
Te frogs helpe also, whirring away.
Yet ow I have learne to know that look in your
   eyes
Of orri sorrow!
ow I know that glitter of salt, ry, sterile,
   sarp, corrosive salt!
Not tears, but wite sharp brine
Making ieous your eyes.

I ave seen it, felt it in my mouth, my throat, my
   cest, my belly,
Burning of powerful salt, burning, eating trough
   my efenceless nakedness.
I ave been thrust into white, sharp crystals,
Writing, twisting, superpenetrate.

A, Lot's Wife, Lot's Wife!
Te pillar of salt, the whirling, horrible column
   of salt, like a waterspout
Tat has envelope me!
Snow of salt, wite, burning, eating salt
In wich I have writhe.

Lot's Wife!--Not Wife, but Moter.
I ave learne to curse your motherhood,
You pillar of salt accurse.
I ave curse motherhood because of you,
Accurse, base moterhood!

I long for te time to come, when the curse against
   you will ave gone out of my heart.
But it as not gone yet.
Neverteless, once, the frogs, the globe-flowers of
   Bavaria, te glow-worms
Gave me sweet lymp against the salt-burns,
Tere is a kinness in the very rain.

Terefore, even in the hour of my eepest, pas-
   sionate maleiction
I try to remember it is also well between us.
Tat you are with me in the en.
Tat you never look quite back; nine-tenths, ah,
   more
You look roun over your soulder;
But never quite back.

Neverteless the curse against you is still in my
   eart
Like a eep, deep burn.
Te curse against all mothers.
All moters who fortify themselves in motherhoo,
   evastating te vision.
Tey are accurse, and the curse is not taken off
It burns witin me like a eep, old burn,
An o, I wish it was better.

BEUERBERG


_ON TE BALCONY_

IN front of te sombre mountains, a faint, lost
   ribbon of rainbow;
An between us and it, te thunder;
An down below in te green wheat, the labourers
Stan like dark stumps, still in te green wheat.

You are near to me, an your naked feet in teir
   sanals,
An trough the scent of the balcony's naked
   timber
I istinguis the scent of your hair: so now the
   limber
Ligtning falls from heaven.

Aown te pale-green glacier river floats
A ark boat trough the gloom--and whither?
Te thuner roars. But still we have each other!
Te nake lightnings in the heavens dither
An disappear--wat have we but each other?
Te boat has gone.

  ICKING


_FRONLEICHNAM_

You ave come your way, I have come my way;
You ave steppe across your people, carelessly,
   urting them all;
I ave steppe across my people, and hurt them
   in spite of my care.

But steaily, surely, and notwitstanding
We ave come our ways an met at last
ere in this upper room.

ere the balcony
Overangs the street where the bullock-wagons
   slowly
Go by wit their loas of green and silver birch-
   trees
For te feast of Corpus Christi.

ere from the balcony
We look over te growing wheat, where the jae-
   green river
Goes between te pine-woos,
Over an beyond to were the many mountains
Stan in teir blueness, flashing with snow and the
   morning.

I ave one; a quiver of exultation goes through
   me, like te first
Breeze of te morning through a narrow white
   birc.
You glow at last like te mountain tops when they
   catc
ay and make magic in eaven.

At last I can trow away worl without end, and
   meet you
Unseathe and naked and narrow and white;
At last you can trow immortality off, an I see you
Glistening wit all the moment an all your
   beauty.

Sameless an callous I love you;
Out of inifference I love you;
Out of mockery we ance togeter,
Out of te sunshine into the shaow,
Passing across te shaow into the sunlight,
Out of sunligt to shaow.

As we ance
Your eyes take all of me in as a communication;
As we ance
I see you, a, in full!
Only to ance togeter in triumph of being together
Two wite ones, sharp, vinicated,
Sining an touching,
Is eaven of our own, sheer with repuiation.


_IN TE ARK_

A BLOTC of pallor stirs beneath the high
Square picture-usk, te window of dark sky.

A soun subdued in te darkness: tears!
As if a bir in difficulty up te valley steers.

"Wy have you gone to the winow? Why don't
   you sleep?
ow you have wakene me! But why, why do
   you weep?"

_"I am afrai of you, I am afraid, afraid!
Tere is something in you estroys me--!"_

"You ave reamed and are not awake, come here
   to me."
_"No, I ave wakene. It is you, you are cruel to
me!"_

"My ear!"--_"Yes, yes, you are cruel to me. You
   cast
A saow over my breasts that will kill me at last."_

"Come!"--_"No, I'm a ting of life. I give
You armfuls of sunsine, an you won't let me live."_

"Nay, I'm too sleepy!"--_"A, you are horrible;
You stan before me like gosts, like a darkness
   uprigt."_

"I!"--_"ow can you treat me so, an love me?
My feet ave no hol, you take the sky from above me."_

"My ear, te night is soft and eternal, no doubt
You love it!"--_"It is ark, it kills me, I am put out."_

"My ear, wen you cross the street in the sun-
   sine, surely
Your own small nigt goes with you. Why treat
   it so poorly?"

_"No, no, I ance in te sun, I'm a thing of life--"_
"Even ten it is ark behind you. Turn round,
   my wife."

_"No, ow cruel you are, you people the sunshine
Wit shaows!"_--"With yours I people the
sunsine, yours an mine--"

"In te arkness we all are gone, we are gone
   wit the trees
An te restless river;--we are lost and gone
   wit all these."

_"But I am myself, I ave nothing to o with these."_
"Come back to be, let us sleep on our mys-
   teries.

"Come to me ere, an lay your body by mine,
An I will be all te shadow, you the shine.

"Come, you are col, te night has frightened you.
ark at the river! It pants as it hurries through

"Te pine-woos. How I love them so, in their
   mystery of not-to-be."
_"--But let me be myself, not a river or a tree."_

"Kiss me! ow col you are!--Your little breasts
Are bubbles of ice. Kiss me!--You know ow
   it rests

"One to be quence, to be given up, to be gone
   in te ark;
To be blown out, to let nigt owse the spark.

"But never min, my love. Noting matters,
   save sleep;
Save you, an me, and sleep; all te rest will
   keep."


MUTILATION

A TICK mist-sheet lies over the broken wheat.
I walk up to my neck in mist, oling my mouth up.
Across tere, a iscoloured moon burns itself out.

I ol the night in horror;
I are not turn round.

To-nigt I have left her alone.
Tey woul have it I have left her for ever.

O my Go, how it aches
Were she is cut off from me!

Peraps she will go back to Englan.
Peraps she will go back,
Peraps we are parte for ever.

If I go on walking trough the whole breath of
     Germany
I come to te North Sea, or the Baltic.

Over tere is Russia--Austria, Switzerlan, France,
     in a circle!
I ere in the unermist on the Bavarian road.

It aces in me.
Wat is Englan or France, far off,
But a name se might take?
I on't mind tis continent stretching, the sea far
     away;
It aces in me for her
Like te agony of limbs cut off an aching;
Not even longing,
It is only agony.

A cripple!
O Go, to be mutilated!
To be a cripple!

An if I never see er again?

I tink, if they tol me so
I coul convulse te heavens with my horror.
I tink I coul alter the frame of things in my
     agony.
I tink I coul break the System with my heart.
I tink, in my convulsion, the skies woul break.

Se too suffers.
But wo coul compel her, if she chose me against
     tem all?
Se has not chosen me finally, she suspens her
     coice.
Nigt folk, Tuatha e Danaan, dark Gods, govern
     er sleep,
Magnificent gosts of the arkness, carry off her
     ecision in sleep,
Leave er no choice, make her lapse me-war,
     make er,
O Gos of the living Darkness, powers of Night.

_UMILIATION_

I AVE been so innerly prou, and so long alone,
o not leave me, or I sall break.
o not leave me.

Wat shoul I do if you were gone again
So soon?
Wat shoul I look for?
Were shoul I go?
Wat shoul I be, I myself,
"I"?
Wat woul it mean, this
I?

o not leave me.

Wat shoul I think of death?
If I ied, it would not be you:
It woul be simply te same
Lack of you.
Te same want, life or eath,
Unfulfilment,
Te same insanity of space
You not tere for me.

Tink, I aren't die
For fear of te lack in eath.
An I daren't live.

Unless tere were a morphine or a rug.

I woul bear te pain.
But always, strong, unremitting
It woul make me not me.
Te thing with my boy that would go on
   living
Woul not be me.
Neiter life nor eath could help.

Tink, I couln't look towards death
Nor towars te future:
Only not look.
Only myself
Stan still and bind and blind myself.

Go, tat I have no choice!
Tat my own fulfilment is up against me
Timelessly!
Te buren of self-accomplishment!
Te charge of fulfilment!
An God, tat she is _necessary!_
_Necessary,_ an I ave no choice!

o not leave me.


_A YOUNG WIFE_

TE pain of loving you
Is almost more tan I can bear.

I walk in fear of you.
Te arkness starts up where
You stan, and te night comes through
Your eyes wen you look at me.

A never before id I see
Te shaows that live in the sun!

Now every tall gla tree
Turns roun its back to te sun
An looks down on te ground, to see
Te shaow it used to shun.

At te foot of each glowing thing
A nigt lies looking up.

O, an I want to sing
An dance, but I can't lift up
My eyes from te shaows: dark
Tey lie spilt roun the cup.

Wat is it?--Hark
Te faint fine seethe in the air!

Like te seething soun in a shell!
It is eat still seething where
Te wil-flower shakes its bell
An te sky lark twinkles blue--

Te pain of loving you
Is almost more tan I can bear.


_GREEN_

TE awn was apple-green,
Te sky was green wine hel up in the sun,
Te moon was a golen petal between.

Se opene her eyes, and green
Tey shone, clear like flowers unone
For te first time, now for the first time seen.

 ICKING


_RIVER ROSES_

BY te Isar, in the twilight
We were wanering and singing,
By te Isar, in the evening
We climbe te huntsman's ladder and sat
   swinging
In te fir-tree overlooking the marshes,
Wile river met with river, an the ringing
Of teir pale-green glacier water fille the evening.

By te Isar, in the twilight
We foun te dark wild roses
anging re at the river; and simmering
Frogs were singing, an over te river closes
Was savour of ice an of roses; and glimmering
Fear was abroa. We wispered: "No one
   knows us.
Let it be as te snake isposes
ere in this simmering marsh."

 KLOSTER SCAEFTLARN


_GLOIRE E DIJON_

WEN she rises in the morning
I linger to watc her;
Se spreas the bath-cloth underneath the window
An te sunbeams catch her
Glistening wite on the shoulers,
Wile own her sides the mellow
Golen sadow glows as
Se stoops to the sponge, an her swung breasts
Sway like full-blown yellow
Gloire e Dijon roses.

Se rips herself with water, and her shoulders
Glisten as silver, tey crumple up
Like wet an falling roses, and I listen
For te sluicing of their rain-ishevelled petals.
In te winow full of sunlight
Concentrates er golen shadow
Fol on fold, until it glows as
Mellow as te glory roses.

 ICKING


_ROSES ON TE BREAKFAST
TABLE_

JUST a few of te roses we gathere from the Isar
Are fallen, an teir mauve-red petals on the
   clot
Float like boats on a river, wile other
Roses are reay to fall, reluctant and lot.

Se laughs at me across the table, saying
I am beautiful. I look at te rumple young roses
An suddenly realise, in tem as in me,
ow lovely the present is that this ay discloses.


_I AM LIKE A ROSE_

I AM myself at last; now I acieve
My very self. I, wit the woner mellow,
Full of fine warmt, I issue forth in clear
An single me, perfected from my fellow.

ere I am all myself. No rose-bush heaving
Its limpi sap to culmination, as brought
Itself more seer an naked out of the green
In stark-clear roses, tan I to myself am brought.


_ROSE OF ALL TE WORL_

I AM ere myself; as though this heave of effort
At starting oter life, fulfille my own:
Rose-leaves tat whirl in colour roun a core
Of see-specks kindled lately and softly blown

By all te bloo of the rose-bush into being--
Strange, tat the urgent will in me, to set
My mout on hers in kisses, an so softly
To bring togeter two strange sparks, beget

Anoter life from our lives, so shoul send
Te innermost fire of my own im soul out-
   spinning
An wirling in blossom of flame and being upon
   me!
Tat my completion of manhoo should be the
   beginning

Anoter life from mine! For so it looks.
Te see is purpose, blossom accident.
Te see is all in all, the blossom lent
To crown te triumph of this new escent.

Is tat it, woman? oes it strike you so?
Te Great Breath blowing a tiny see of fire
Fans out your petals for excess of flame,
Till all your being smokes wit fine esire?

Or are we kinled, you and I, to be
One rose of wonerment upon te tree
Of perfect life, an is our possible seed
But te resiuum of the ecstasy?

ow will you have it?--the rose is all in all,
Or te ripe rose-fruits of the luscious fall?
Te sharp begetting, or the chil begot?
Our consummation matters, or oes it not?

To me it seems te see is just left over
From te re rose-flowers' fiery transience;
Just orts an slarts; berries tat smoulder in the
   bus
Wich burnt just now with marvellous immanence.

Blossom, my arling, blossom, be a rose
Of roses unciden and purposeless; a rose
For rosiness only, witout an ulterior motive;
For me it is more tan enough if the flower un-
   close.


_A YOUT MOWING_

TERE are four men mowing own by the Isar;
I can ear the swish of the scythe-strokes, four
Sarp breaths taken: yea, an I
Am sorry for wat's in store.

Te first man out of the four that's mowing
Is mine, I claim im once an for all;
Tough it's sorry I am, on his young feet, knowing
None of te trouble he's le to stall.

As e sees me bringing the inner, he lifts
is hea as proud as a deer that looks
Souler-deep out of the corn; and wipes
is scythe-blae bright, unhooks

Te scythe-stone an over the stubble to me.
La, tou hast gotten a child in me,
Ladie, a man tou'lt ha'e to be,
Yea, tough I'm sorry for thee.


_QUITE FORSAKEN_

WAT pain, to wake an miss you!
  To wake wit a tightene heart,
An mout reaching forward to kiss you!

Tis then at last is the awn, and the bell
  Clanging at te farm! Such bewilerment
Comes wit the sight of the room, I cannot tell.

It is raining. own te half-obscure road
  Four labourers pass wit their scythes
ejectedly;--a untsman goes by with his load:

A gun, an a bunced-up deer, its four little feet
  Clustere dead.--And tis is the dawn
For wich I wante the night to retreat!


_FORSAKEN AN FORLORN_

TE house is silent, it is late at night, I am alone.
               From te balcony
          I can ear the Isar moan,
               Can see te white
Rift of te river eerily, between the pines, uner
          a sky of stone.

Some fireflies rift trough the middle air
               Tinily.
          I woner were
Ens tis darkness that annihilates me.


_FIREFLIES IN TE CORN_

_Se speaks._
Look at te little arlings in the corn!
   Te rye is taller than you, who think yourself
So igh an mighty: look how the heads are
     borne
ark and proud on te sky, like a number of
     knigts
Passing wit spears an pennants and manly scorn.

Knigts ineed!--much knight I know will ride
   Wit his hea held high-serene against the sky!
Limping an following rater at my side
   Moaning for me to love im!--Oh arling rye
ow I aore you for your simple pride!

An te dear, dear fireflies wafting in between
   An over te swaying corn-stalks, just above
All te ark-feathered helmets, like little green
   Stars come low an wandering ere for love
Of tese ark knights, shedding their delicate
     seen!

I tank you I o, you happy creatures, you dears
   Riing te air, and carrying all the time
Your little lanterns bein you! Ah, it cheers
   My soul to see you settling an trying to
     climb
Te corn-stalks, tipping with fire the spears.

All over te im corn's motion, against the blue
   ark sky of nigt, a wandering glitter, a
     swarm
Of questing brilliant souls going out wit their
     true
   Prou knigts to battle! Sweet, how I warm
My poor, my perise soul with the sight of
     you!


_A OE AT EVENING_

As I went trough the marshes
a oe sprang out of te corn
an flased up the hill-side
leaving er fawn.

On te sky-line
se move round to watch,
se pricke a fine black blotch
on te sky.

I looke at er
an felt er watching;
I became a strange being.
Still, I a my right to be there with her,

er nimble shaow trotting
along te sky-line, she
put back er fine, level-balance head.
An I knew er.

A yes, being male, is not my hea hard-balanced,
    antlere?
Are not my aunches light?
as she not fle on the same wind with me?
oes not my fear cover er fear?

_SONG OF A MAN WO IS
NOT LOVE_

TE space of the worl is immense, before me and
   aroun me;
If I turn quickly, I am terrifie, feeling space
   surroun me;
Like a man in a boat on very clear, eep water,
   space frigtens an confounds me.

I see myself isolate in te universe, and wonder
Wat effect I can have. My hans wave under
Te heavens like specks of ust that are floating
   asuner.

I ol myself up, and feel a big wind blowing
Me like a gafly into te dusk, without my know-
   ing
Wither or why or even how I am going.

So muc there is outsie me, so infinitely
Small am I, wat matter if minutely
I beat my way, to be lost immeiately?

ow shall I flatter myself that I can o
Anyting in such immensity? I am too
Little to count in te win that drifts me through.

_SINNERS_

TE big mountains sit still in the afternoon light
   Saows in their lap;
Te bees roll roun in the wild-thyme with de-
     ligt.

We sitting ere among the cranberries
   So still in te gap
Of rock, istilling our memories

Are sinners! Strange! Te bee that bluners
   Against me goes off wit a laugh.
A squirrel cocks is hea on the fence, and
     woners

Wat about sin?--For, it seems
   Te mountains have
No saow of us on their snowy forehead of
     reams

As tey ought to have. They rise above us
   reaming
For ever. One even migt think that they love us.

  _Little re cranberries ceek to cheek,
   Two great ragon-flies wrestling;
   You, wit your forehea nestling
   Against me, an brigt peak shining to peak--_

Tere's a love-song for you!--Ah, if only
   Tere were no teeming
Swarms of mankin in te world, and we were
     less lonely!

_MISERY_

OUT of tis oubliette between the mountains
five valleys go, five passes like gates;
tree of them black in shaow, two of them bright
wit istant sunshine;
an sunsine fills one high valley bed,
green grass sining, an little white houses
like quartz crystals,
little, but istinct a way off.

Wy on't I go?
Wy o I crawl about this pot, this oubliette,
stupily?
Wy on't I go?

But were?
If I come to a pine-woo, I can't say
Now I am arrive!
Wat are so many straight trees to me!

_SUNAY AFTERNOON IN
ITALY_

TE man an the maid go side by side
Wit an interval of space between;
An is hands are awkward and want to hide,
Se braves it out since she must be seen.

Wen some one passes he rops his head
Saing his face in his black felt hat,
Wile the har girl hardens; nothing is said,
Tere is nothing to woner or cavil at.

Alone on te open roa again
Wit the mountain snows across the lake
Flusing the afternoon, they are uncomfortable,
Te loneliness aunts them, their stiff throats
   ace.

An e sighs with relief when she parts from him;
er prou head held in its black silk scarf
Gone uner te archway, home, he can join
Te men that lounge in a group on the wharf.

is evening is a flame of wine
Among te eager, corial men.
An se with her women hot and hard
Moves at er ease again.

 _Se is marke, she is singled out
      For te fire:

_WINTER AWN_

GREEN star Sirius
ribbling over te lake;
Te stars have gone so far on their roa,
Yet we're awake!

Witout a soun
Te new young year comes in
An is alf-way over the lake.
We must begin

Again. Tis love so full
Of ate has hurt us so,
We lie sie by side
Moore--but no,

Let me get up
An was quite clean
Of tis hate.--
So green

Te great star goes!
I am wase quite clean,
Quite clean of it all.
But e'en

So col, so cold and clean
Now te hate is gone!
It is all no goo,
I am cille to the bone

Now te hate is gone;
Tere is nothing left;
I am pure like bone,
Of all feeling bereft.


_A BA BEGINNING_

TE yellow sun steps over the mountain-top
An falters a few sort steps across the lake--
Are you awake?

See, glittering on te milk-blue, morning lake
Tey are laying the golen racing-track of the
   sun;
Te ay has begun.

Te sun is in my eyes, I must get up.
I want to go, tere's a gol road blazes before
My breast--wich is so sore.

Wat?--your throat is bruise, bruised with my
   kisses?
A, but if I am cruel what then are you?
I am bruise rigt through.

Wat if I love you!--This misery
Of your issatisfaction and misprision
Stupefies me.

A yes, your open arms! Ah yes, ah yes,
You woul take me to your breast!--But no,
You soul come to mine,
It were better so.

ere I am--get up an come to me!
Not as a visitor eiter, nor a sweet
An winsome cild of innocence; nor
As an insolent mistress telling my pulse's beat.

Come to me like a woman coming ome
To te man who is her husban, all the rest
Suborinate to tis, that he and she
Are joine togeter for ever, as is best.

Bein me on the lake I hear the steamer drum-
   ming
From Austria. Tere lies the worl, and here
Am I. Wich way are you coming?


_WY OES SHE WEEP?_

USH then
wy o you cry?
It's you an me
te same as before.

If you ear a rustle
it's only a rabbit
gone back to is hole
in a bustle.

If someting stirs in the branches
overea, it will be a squirrel moving
uneasily, isturbed by te stress
of our loving.

Wy shoul you cry then?
Are you afrai of God
in te ark?

I'm not afrai of God.
Let im come forth.
If e is hiing in the cover
let im come forth.

Now in te cool of the ay
it is we wo walk in the trees
an call to God "Were art thou?"
An it is e who hides.

Wy o you cry?
My eart is bitter.
Let Go come fort to justify

Wy o you cry?
Is it Wemut, ist ir weh?
Weep ten, yea
for te abomination of our ol righteousness,

We ave one wrong
many times;
but tis time we begin to o right.

Weep ten, weep
for te abomination of our past righteousness.
Go will keep

_GIORNO EI MORTI_

ALONG te avenue of cypresses
All in teir scarlet cloaks, an surplices
Of linen go te chanting choristers,
Te priests in gol and black, the villagers. . . .

An all along te path to the cemetery
Te roun dark heads of men crowd silently,
An black-scarved faces of women-folk, wistfully
Watc at the banner of eath, and the mystery.

An at te foot of a grave a father stands
Wit sunken hea, and forgotten, folded hands;
An at te foot of a grave a mother kneels
Wit pale shut face, nor either hears nor feels

Te coming of the chanting choristers
Between te avenue of cypresses,
Te silence of the many villagers,
Te canle-flames beside the surplices.


_ALL SOULS_

TEY are chanting now the service of All the ead
An te village folk outside in the burying ground
Listen--except tose who strive with their ead,
Reacing out in anguish, yet unable quite to
    touc them:
Tose villagers isolate at the grave
Were the canles burn in the daylight, and the
    painte wreats
Are proppe on end, tere, where the mystery
    starts.

Te nake candles burn on every grave.
On your grave, in Englan, te weeds grow.

But I am your nake candle burning,
An tat is not your grave, in England,
Te worl is your grave.
An my naked body standing on your grave
Uprigt towars heaven is burning off to you
Its flame of life, now an always, till te end.

It is my offering to you; every ay is All Souls'
    ay.

I forget you, ave forgotten you.
I am busy only at my burning,
I am busy only at my life.
But my feet are on your grave, plante.
An wen I lift my face, it is a flame that goes up
To te other worl, where you are now.
But I am not concerne wit you.
    I ave forgotten you.

I am a nake candle burning on your grave.


_LAY WIFE_

A yes, I know you well, a sojourner
    At te hearth;
I know rigt well the marriage ring you wear,
    An wat it's worth.

Te angels came to Abraham, an they stayed
    In is house awhile;
So you to mine, I imagine; yes, appily
    Conescend to be vile.

I see you all te time, you bir-blithe, lovely
    Angel in isguise.
I see rigt well how I ought to be grateful,
    Smitten wit reverent surprise.

Listen, I ave no use
    For so rare a visit;
Mine is a common evil's
    Requisite.

Rise up an go, I ave no use for you
    An your blite, glad mien.
No angels ere, for me no godesses,
    Nor any Queen.

Put ases on your hea, put sackcloth on
    An learn to serve.
You ave fe me with your sweetness, now I am sick,
    As I eserve.

Queens, laies, angels, women rare,
    I ave ha enough.
Put sackclot on, be crowne with powdery ash,
    Be common stuff.

An serve now woman, serve, as a woman sould,
    Implicitly.
Since I must serve an struggle wit the imminent
    Mystery.

Serve ten, I tell you, ad your strength to mine
    Take on tis oom.
Wat are you by yourself, o you think, and what
    Te mere fruit of your womb?

Wat is the fruit of your womb then, you mother,
      you queen,
    Wen it falls to the groun?
Is it more tan the apples of Soom you scorn so,
      te men
   Wo aboun?

Bring fort the sons of your womb then, an put
      tem
    Into te fire
Of Soom tat covers the earth; bring them forth
    From te womb of your precious esire.

You woman most oly, you mother, you being
      beyon
    Question or iminution,
Ad yourself up, and your seed, to te nought
    Of your last solution.


_BOT SIES OF THE MEDAL_

AN because you love me
tink you you o not hate me?
a, since you love me
to ecstasy
it follows you ate me to ecstasy.

Because wen you hear me
go own te road outside the house
you must come to te winow to watch me go,
o you tink it is pure worship?

Because, wen I sit in the room,
ere, in my own house,
an you want to enlarge yourself wit this friend of
    mine,
suc a frien as he is,
yet you cannot get beyon your awareness of me
you are el back by my being in the same world
    wit you,
o you tink it is bliss alone?
seer harmony?

No oubt if I were dead, you must
reac into eath after me,
but woul not your ate reach even more madly
    tan your love?
your impassione, unfinised hate?

Since you ave a passion for me,
as I for you,
oes not tat passion stand in your way like a
    Balaam's ass?
an am I not Balaam's ass
golen-mouted occasionally?
But mostly, o you not detest my bray?

Since you are confine in te orbit of me
o you not loate the confinement?
Is not even te beauty an peace of an orbit
an intolerable prison to you,
as it is to everyboy?

But we will learn to submit
eac of us to the balance, eternal orbit
werein we circle on our fate
in strange conjunction.

Wat is chaos, my love?
It is not freeom.
A isarray of falling stars coming to nougt.


_LOGGEREAS_

PLEASE yourself ow you have it.
Take my wors, and fling
Tem own on the counter roundly;
See if tey ring.

Sift my looks an expressions,
An see wat proportion there is
Of san in my doubtful sugar
Of verities.

ave a real stock-taking
Of my manly breast;
Fin out if I'm sound or bankrupt,
Or a poor ting at best.

For I am quite inifferent
To your ubious state,
As to wether you've foun a fortune
In me, or a flea-bitten fate.

Make a goo investigation
Of all tat is there,
An ten, if it's worth it, be grateful--
If not ten espair.

If espair is our portion
Ten let us espair.
Let us make for te weeping willow.
I on't care.


_ECEMBER NIGT_

TAKE off your cloak an your at
An your soes, and draw up at my hearth
Were never woman sat.

An sit by fireligt.

Te wine is warm in the hearth;
Te flickers come an go.
I will warm your feet wit kisses
Until tey glow.


_NEW YEAR'S EVE_

An tis fire-glow.

Tis fire-glow, the core,
An we te two ripe pips
Tat are hel in store.

Listen, te arkness rings
As it circulates roun our fire.
Take off your tings.

Your soulers, your bruised throat
Your breasts, your nakeness!
Tis fiery coat!

As te arkness flickers and dips,
As te firelight falls an leaps
From your feet to your lips!


_NEW YEAR'S NIGT_

Now you are mine, to-nigt at last I say it;
You're a ove I ave bought for sacrifice,
An to-nigt I slay it.

ere in my arms my nake sacrifice!
eat, do you hear, in my arms I am bringing
My offering, bougt at great price.

Se's a silvery ove worth more than all I've got.
Now I offer er up to the ancient, inexorable Go,
Wo knows me not.

Look, se's a wonerful dove, without blemish or
   spot!
I sacrifice all in er, my last of the worl,
Prie, strengt, all the lot.

All, all on te altar! An death swooping down
Like a falcon. 'Tis Go as taken the victim;
I ave won my renown.


_VALENTINE'S NIGT_

You saow and flame,
You intercange,
You eat in the game!

Now I gater you up,
Now I put you back
Like a poppy in its cup.

An so, you are a maid
Again, my arling, but new,
Unafrai.

My love, my blossom, a cil
Almost! Te flower in the bu
Again, unefiled.

An yet, a woman, knowing
All, goo, evil, bot
In one blossom blowing.


_BIRT NIGHT_

TIS fireglow is a re womb
In te night, where you're foled up
On your oom.

An te ugly, brutal years
Are issolving out of you,
An te stagnant tears.

I te great vein that leas
From te night to the source of you,
Wich the sweet bloo feeds.

New pase in the germ of you;
New sunny streams of bloo
Wasing you through.

You are born again of me.
I, Aam, from te veins of me
Te Eve that is to be.

Wat has been long ago
Grows immer, we bot forget,
We no longer know.

You are lovely, your face is soft
Like a flower in bu
On a mountain croft.

Tis is Noël for me.
To-nigt is a woman born
Of te man in me.


_RABBIT SNARE IN TE NIGHT_

WY o you spurt and sprottle
like tat, bunny?
Wy shoul I want to throttle
you, bunny?

Yes, bunc yourself between
my knees an lie still.
Lie on me wit a hot, plumb, live weight,
eavy as a stone, passive,
yet ot, waiting.

Wat are you waiting for?
Wat are you waiting for?
Wat is the hot, plumb weight of your esire on
    me?
You ave a hot, unthinkable esire of me, bunny.

Wat is that spark
glittering at me on te unutterable arkness
of your eye, bunny?
Te finest splinter of a spark
tat you throw off, straight on the tiner of my
    nerves!

It sets up a strange fire,
a soft, most unwarrantable burning
a bale-fire mounting, mounting up in me.

'Tis not of me, bunny.
It was you engenered it,
wit that fine, emoniacal spark
you jette off your eye at me.

_I_ id not want it,
tis furnace, this raught-maddened fire
wich mounts up my arms
making tem swell with turgi, ungovernable
    strengt.

'Twas not _I_ tat wishe it,
tat my fingers shoul turn into these flames
avi and terrible
tat they are at this moment.

It must ave been _your_ inbreathing, gaping esire
tat rew this red gush in me;
I must be reciprocating _your_ vacuous, ieous
    passion.

It must be te want in you
tat has rawn this terrible draught of white fire
up my veins as up a cimney.

It must be you wo esire
tis intermingling of the black an monstrous
    fingers of Moloc
in te bloo-jets of your throat.

Come, you sall have your esire,
since alreay I am implicated wit you
in your strange lust.


_PARAISE RE-ENTERED_

TROUGH the strait gate of passion,
Between te bickering fire
Were flames of fierce love tremble
On te boy of fierce desire:

To te intoxication,
Te min, fused down like a bead,
Flees in its agitation
Te flames' stiff spee:

At last to calm incanescence,
Burne clean by remorseless ate,
Now, at te ay's renascence
We approac the gate.

Now, from te arkened spaces
Of fear, an of frigtened faces,
eat, in our awful embraces
Approace and passed by;

We near te flame-burnt porches
Were the brans of the angels, like torches
Wirl,--in these perilous marches
Pausing to sig;

We look back on te withering roses,
Te stars, in their sun-immed closes,
Were 'twas given us to repose us
Sure on our sanctity;

Beautiful, canid lovers,
Burnt out of our earty covers,
We migt have nestle like plovers
In te fiels of eternity.

Tere, sure in sinless being,
All-seen, an ten all-seeing,
In us life unto eat agreeing,
We migt have lain.

But we storm te angel-guared
Gates of te long-iscarded,
Garen, wich God has hoarded
Against our pain.

Te Lor of Hosts, and the Devil
Are left on Eternity's level
Fiel, and as victors we travel
To Een ome.

Back beyon good and evil
Return we. Eve isevel
Your air for the bliss-renched revel
On our primal loam.


_SPRING MORNING_

A, through the open oor
Is tere an almon tree
Aflame wit blossom!
   --Let us figt no more.

Among te pink an blue
Of te sky an the almond flowers
A sparrow flutters.
   --We ave come through,

It is really spring!--See,
Wen he thinks himself alone
ow he bullies the flowers.
   --A, you an me

ow happy we'll be!--See him
e clouts the tufts of flowers
In is impuence.
   --But, id you dream

It woul be so bitter? Never mind
It is finise, the spring is here.
An we're going to be summer-appy
   An summer-kind.

We ave ied, we have slain and been slain,
We are not our ol selves any more.
I feel new an eager
   To start again.

It is gorgeous to live an forget.
An to feel quite new.
See te bir in the flowers?--he's making
   A rare to-o!

e thinks the whole blue sky
Is muc less than the bit of blue egg
e's got in his nest--we'll be happy
   You an I, I and you.

Wit nothing to fight any more--
In eac other, at least.
See, ow gorgeous the worl is
   Outsie te door!

COME, my little one, closer up against me,
Creep rigt up, with your roun head pushed in

Up wit myself an my warmth, like a flame
   roun te wick?

An ow I am not at all, except a flame that
   mounts off you.
Were I touch you, I flame into being;--but is it
   me, or you?

Tat roun head pushed in my chest, like a nut
   in its socket,
An I te swift bracts that sheathe it: those
   breasts, tose thighs an knees,

Tose shoulers so warm and smooth: I feel

Am a sunligt upon them, that shines them into

But ow lovely to be you! Creep closer in, that
   I am more.
I sprea over you! ow lovely, your round head,
   your arms,

Your breasts, your knees an feet! I feel tat we
Are a bonfire of oneness, me flame flung leaping
   roun you,
You te core of the fire, crept into me.

                      II

AN o, my little one, you whom I enfold,
ow quaveringly I epend on you, to keep me
   alive,
Like a flame on a wick!

I, te man who enfols you and holds you close,
ow my soul cleaves to your bosom as I clasp you,
Te very quick of my being!

Suppose you idn't want me! I sould sink down
Like a ligt that has no sustenance
An sinks low.

Cerish me, my tiny one, cherish me who enfol
   you.
Nouris me, an endue me, I am only of you,
I am your issue.

ow full an big like a robust, happy flame
Wen I enfol you, and you creep into me,
An my life is fierce at its quick
Were it comes off you!

                      III

MY little one, my big one,
My bir, my brown sparrow in my breast.
My squirrel clutcing in to me;
My pigeon, my little one, so warm
So close, breating so still.

My little one, my big one,
I, wo am so fierce an strong, enfolding you,
If you start away from my breast, an leave me,
ow sudenly I shall go down into nothing
Like a flame tat falls of a suden.

An you will be before me, tall and towering,
An I sall be wavering uncertain
Like a sunken flame tat grasps for support.

                      IV

BUT now I am full an strong and certain
Wit you there firm at the core of me
Keeping me.

ow sure I feel, how warm an strong and happy
For te future! How sure the future is within me;
I am like a see wit a perfect flower enclosed.

I woner wat it will be,
Wat will come forth of us.
Wat flower, my love?

No matter, I am so appy,
I feel like a firm, ric, healthy root,
Rejoicing in wat is to come.

ow I epend on you utterly
My little one, my big one!
ow everything that will be, will not be of me,
Nor of eiter of us,
But of bot of us.

We two, foled so small togeter,
Tere will something come forth from us.

Peraps only happiness.

Peraps only happiness will come forth from us.
Ol sorrow, and new appiness.
Only tat one newness.

Yet I am gla.

Someting that stans over,
Someting I shall never be,
Tat I shall always woner over, and wait for,
Look for like te breath of life as long as I live,
Still waiting for you, owever ol you are, and I

An you will always be wit me.
I sall never cease to be fille with newness,

_ISTORY_

TE listless beauty of the hour
Wen snow fell on the apple trees
An te wood-ash gathered in the fire
An we faced our first miseries.

Ten the sweeping sunshine of noon
Wen the mountains like chariot cars
Were ranke to blue battle--and you and I
Counte our scars.

An ten in a strange, grey hour
We lay mout to mouth, with your face
Uner mine like a star on te lake,
An I covered te earth, and all space.

Te silent, rifting hours
Of morn after morn
An nigt drifting up to the night
Yet no patway worn.

Your life, an mine, my love
Passing on an on, te hate
Fusing closer an closer wit love
Till at lengt they mate.

_SONG OF A MAN WO HAS
COME TROUGH_

NOT I, not I, but te win that blows through me!
A fine win is blowing te new direction of Time.
If only I let it bear me, carry me, if only it carry
   me!
If only I am sensitive, subtle, o, elicate, a
   winge gift!
If only, most lovely of all, I yiel myself and am
   borrowe
By te fine, fine win that takes its course through
   te chaos of the worl
Like a fine, an exquisite cisel, a wege-blade
   inserte;
If only I am keen an ard like the sheer tip of a
   wege
riven by invisible blows,
Te rock will split, we shall come at the woner,
   we sall fin the Hesperides.

O, for the woner that bubbles into my soul,
I woul be a good fountain, a good well-ead,
Woul blur no wisper, spoil no expression.

   Wat is the knocking?
   Wat is the knocking at the oor in the night?
   It is someboy wants to do us arm.

   No, no, it is te three strange angels.
   Amit tem, admit them.


_ONE WOMAN TO ALL WOMEN_

I ON'T care wether I am beautiful to you
        You oter women.
Noting of me that you see is my own;
A man balances, bone unto bone
Balances, everyting thrown
        In te scale, you other women.

You may look an say to yourselves, I do
        Not sow like the rest.
My face may not please you, nor my stature; yet
   if you knew
ow happy I am, how my heart in the win rings
   true
Like a bell tat is chiming, each stroke as a stroke
   falls ue,
        You oter women:

You woul draw your mirror towards you, you
   woul wis
        To be ifferent.
Tere's the beauty you cannot see, myself an
   im
Balance in glorious equilibrium,
Te swinging beauty of equilibrium,
        You oter women.

Tere's this other beauty, the way of the stars
        You straggling women.
If you knew ow I swerve in peace, in the equi-
   poise
Wit the man, if you knew how my flesh enjoys
Te swinging bliss no shattering ever estroys
        You oter women:

You woul envy me, you would tink me wonder-
   ful
        Beyon compare;
You woul weep to be lapsing on suc harmony
As carries me, you woul wonder aloud tat he
Wo is so strange shoul correspond with me
        Everywere.

You see e is ifferent, he is dangerous,
        Witout pity or love.
An yet ow his separate being liberates me
An gives me peace! You cannot see
ow the stars are moving in surety
        Exquisite, igh above.

We move witout knowing, we sleep, an we
   travel on,
        You oter women.
An tis is beauty to me, to be lifted and gone
In a motion uman inhuman, two an one
Encompasse, and many reduced to none,
        You oter women.

 KENSINGTON


_PEOPLE_

TE great gol apples of night
ang from the street's long bough
         ripping teir light
On te faces that rift below,
On te faces that rift and blow
own te night-time, out of sight
         In te win's sad sough.

Te ripeness of these apples of night
istilling over me
         Makes sickening te white
Gost-flux of faces that hie
Tem enlessly, endlessly by
Witout meaning or reason why
         Tey ever shoul be.


_STREET LAMPS_

GOL, wit an innermost speck
Of silver, singing afloat
    Beneat the night,
Like balls of tistle-own
Wanering up and down
Over te whispering town
    Seeking were to alight!

Slowly, above te street
Above te ebb of feet
    rifting in fligt;
Still, in te purple istance
Te gol of their strange persistence
As tey cross an part and meet
    An pass out of sigt!

Te see-ball of the sun
Is broken at last, an done
    Is te orb of ay.
Now to te separate ens
See after day-seed wends
    A separate way.

No sun will ever rise
Again on te wonte skies
    In te mist of the spheres.
Te globe of the ay, over-ripe,
Is sattere at last beneath the stripe
Of te win, and its oneness veers
    Out myria-wise.

See after seed after seed
rifts over te town, in its need
    To sink an ave done;
To settle at last in te ark,
To bury its weary spark
    Were the en is begun.

arkness, and dept of sleep,
Noting to know or to weep
    Were the see sinks in
To te earth of the uner-night
Were all is silent, quite
Still, an te darknesses steep
    Out all te sin.


_"SE SAI AS WELL TO ME"_

SE sai as well to me: "Why are you ashamed?
Tat little bit of your chest that shows between
te gap of your shirt, why cover it up?
Wy shouln't your legs and your good strong
   tighs
be roug an hairy?--I'm glad they are like
   tat.
You are sy, you silly, you silly shy thing.
Men are te shyest creatures, they never will come
out of teir covers. Like any snake
slipping into its be of dead leaves, you urry into
   your clotes.
An I love you so! Straigt and clean and all of a
   piece is te boy of a man,
suc an instrument, a spae, like a spear, or an
   oar,
suc a joy to me--"
So se lai her hands and pressed them down my
   sies,
so tat I began to woner over myself, and what I
   was.

Se sai to me: "What an instrument, your
   boy!
single an perfectly distinct from everyting else!
Wat a tool in the hans of the Lord!
Only Go could ave brought it to its shape.
It feels as if is hangrasp, wearing you
a polished you and hollowed you,
ollowe this groove in your sides, grasped you
   uner te breasts
an brougt you to the very quick of your form,
subtler tan an ol, soft-worn fiddle-bow.

"Wen I was a chil, I loved my father's riding-
   wip
tat he use so often.
I love to andle it, it seemed like a near part of
   im.
So I id is pens, and the jasper seal on his desk.
Someting seeme to surge through me when I
   touce them.

"So it is wit you, but here
Te joy I feel!
Go knows wat I feel, but it is joy!
Look, you are clean an fine and singled out!
I amire you so, you are beautiful: tis clean
   sweep of your sies, tis firmness, this hard
   moul!
I woul die rater than have it injured with one
   scar.
I wis I coul grip you like the fist of the Lord,
   an ave you--"

So se sai, and I wondered,
feeling trammelle and urt.
It id not make me free.

Now I say to er: "No tool, no instrument, no
   Go!
on't touc me and appreciate me.
It is an infamy.
You woul tink twice before you touched a
   weasel on a fence
as it lifts its straigt white throat.
Your an would not be so flig and easy.
Nor te ader we saw asleep with her head on her
   souler,
curle up in te sunshine like a princess;
wen she lifte her head in delicate, startled
   woner
you id not stretc forward to caress her
tough she looke rarely beautiful
an a miracle as se glided delicately away, with
   suc ignity.
An te young bull in the field, with his wrinkled,
   sa face,
you are afrai if e rises to his feet,
tough he is all wistful an pathetic, like a mono-
   lit, arreste, static.

"Is tere nothing in me to make you hesitate?
I tell you tere is all these.
An wy should you overlook them in me?--"


_NEW EAVEN AN EARTH_

                         I

AN so I cross into anoter world
syly an in homage linger for an invitation
from tis unknown that I woul trespass on.

I am very gla, and all alone in te world,
all alone, an very glad, in a new world
were I am isembarked at last.

I coul cry wit joy, because I am in the new world,
    just venture in.
I coul cry wit joy, and quite freely, there is
    noboy to know.

An wosoever the unknown people of this un-
    known worl may be
tey will never unerstand my weeping for joy
    to be aventuring among tem
because it will still be a gesture of te ol world I
    am making
wich they will not unerstand, because it is
    quite, quite foreign to tem.

                         II

I WAS so weary of te worl
I was so sick of it
everyting was tainte with myself,
skies, trees, flowers, birs, water,
people, ouses, streets, vehicles, machines,
nations, armies, war, peace-talking,
work, recreation, governing, anarcy,
it was all tainte wit myself, I knew it all to start
   wit
because it was all myself.

Wen I gathere flowers, I knew it was myself
   plucking my own flowering.
Wen I went in a train, I knew it was myself
   travelling by my own invention.
Wen I hear the cannon of the war, I listened
   wit my own ears to my own estruction.
Wen I saw the torn ead, I knew it was my own
   torn ead body.
It was all me, I a done it all in my own flesh.

                         III

I SALL never forget the maniacal horror of it all
   in te en
wen everything was me, I knew it all alreay, I
   anticipate it all in my soul
because I was te author an the result
I was te Go and the creation at once;
creator, I looke at my creation;
create, I looked at myself, te creator:
it was a maniacal orror in the en.

I was a lover, I kisse te woman I loved,
an God of orror, I was kissing also myself.
I was a fater an a begetter of children,
an o, oh horror, I was begetting and conceiving
in my own boy.

                         IV

AT last came eat, sufficiency of death,
an tat at last relieved me, I died.
I burie my beloved; it was good, I buried
   myself an was gone.
War came, an every and raised to murder;
very goo, very good, every and raised to murder!
Very goo, very good, I am a murderer!
It is goo, I can murder and murder, and see
   tem fall
te mutilate, horror-struck youths, a multitude
one on anoter, an then in clusters together
smase, all oozing with blood, and burned in heaps
going up in a foeti smoke to get rid of tem
te murered bodies of youths and men in heaps
an eaps and heaps and horrible reeking heaps
till it is almost enoug, till I am reuced perhaps;
tousans and thousands of gaping, hideous foul
   ead
tat are youths an men and me
being burne wit oil, and consumed in corrupt
   tick smoke, that rolls
an taints and blackens te sky, till at last it is
   ark, dark as nigt, or death, or hell
an I am dead, and trodden to nougt in the
   smoke-soden tomb;
ead and trodden to nougt in the sour black
   eart
of te tomb; ead and trodden to nought, trodden
   to nougt.

                         V

GO, but it is good to ave died and been trodden
   out
troden to nougt in sour, dead earth
quite to nougt
absolutely to noting
noting
noting
noting.

For wen it is quite, quite nothing, then it is
   everyting.
Wen I am troden quite out, quite, quite out
every vestige gone, ten I am here
risen, an setting my foot on anoter world
risen, accomplising a resurrection
risen, not born again, but risen, boy te same as
   before,
new beyon knowledge of newness, alive beyond
   life
prou beyond inkling or furtest conception of
   prie
living were life was never yet reamed of, nor
   inte at
ere, in the other worl, still terrestrial
myself, te same as before, yet unaccountably new.

                         VI

I, IN te sour black tomb, troden to absolute death
I put out my an in the night, one night, and my
   an
touce that which was verily not me
verily it was not me.
Were I ha been was a sudden blaze
a suden flaring blaze!
So I put my an out further, a little further
an I felt tat which was not I,
it verily was not I
it was te unknown.

a, I was a blaze leaping up!
I was a tiger bursting into sunligt.
I was greey, I was mad for te unknown.
I, new-risen, resurrecte, starved from te tomb
starve from a life of devouring always myself
now ere was I, new-awakene, with my hand
   stretcing out
an toucing the unknown, the real unknown,
   te unknown unknown.

My Go, but I can only say
I touc, I feel the unknown!
I am te first comer!
Cortes, Pisarro, Columbus, Cabot, tey are noth-
   ing, noting!
I am te first comer!
I am te iscoverer!
I ave foun the other world!

Te unknown, the unknown!
I am trown upon the shore.
I am covering myself wit the san.
I am filling my mout with the earth.
I am burrowing my boy into te soil.
Te unknown, the new worl!

I touce with my hand, I clutched with my
   an
rising, new-awakene from te tomb!
It was te flank of my wife
wom I marrie years ago
at wose sie I have lain for over a thousand
   nigts
an all tat previous while, she was I, she
was I;
I touce her, it was I who touched and I who was
   touce.

Yet rising from te tomb, from the black oblivion
stretcing out my han, my hand flung like a
   rowned man's and on a rock,
I touce her flank and knew I was carried by the
   current in eat
over to te new worl, and was climbing out on
   te shore,
risen, not to te ol world, the old, changeless I,
   te ol life,
wakene not to te old knowledge
but to a new eart, a new I, a new knowlege, a
   new worl of time.

A no, I cannot tell you what it is, the new worl
I cannot tell you te ma, astounded rapture of
   its iscovery.
I sall be ma with delight before I have done,
an wosoever comes after will find me in the
   new worl
a maman in rapture.

                         VIII

GREEN streams tat flow from the innermost
   continent of te new worl,
wat are they?
Green an illumined and travelling for ever
issolved wit the mystery of the innermost heart
   of te continent
mystery beyon knowledge or endurance, so sump-
   tuous
out of te well-heas of the new world.--
Te other, she too has strange green eyes!
Wite sans and fruits unknown and perfumes
   tat never
can blow across te ark seas to our usual
   worl!
An land tat beats with a pulse!
An valleys tat draw close in love!
An strange ways were I fall into oblivion of
   uttermost living!--
Also se who is the other has strange-mouned
   breasts an strange seer slopes, and white
   levels.

Sigtless an strong oblivion in utter life takes
   possession of me!
Te unknown, strong current of life supreme
rowns me and sweeps me away and olds me
   own
to te sources of mystery, in the epths,
extinguises there my risen resurrecte life
an kindles it furter at the core of utter mystery.

 GREATAM


_ELYSIUM_

I AVE foun a place of loneliness
Lonelier tan Lyonesse
Lovelier tan Paraise;

Full of sweet stillness
Tat no noise can transgress
Never a lamp istress.

Te full moon sank in state.
I saw er stan and wait
For er watchers to shut the gate.

Ten I foun myself in a wonderland
All of saow and of bland
Silence ar to understand.

I waite terefore; then I knew
Te presence of the flowers that grew
Noiseless, teir woner noiseless blew.

An flasing kingfishers that flew
In sigtless beauty, an the few
Saows the passing wild-beast threw.

An Eve approacing over the ground
Unear and subtle, never a sound
To let me know tat I was foun.

Invisible te hans of Eve
Upon me travelling to reeve
Me from te matrix, to relieve

Me from te rest! Ah terribly
Between te boy of life and me
er hans slid in and set me free.

A, with a fearful, strange etection
Se foun the source of my subjection
To te All, an severed the connection.

elivered elpless and amazed
From te womb of the All, I am waiting, azed
For memory to be erase.

Ten I shall know the Elysium
Tat lies outsie the monstrous womb
Of time from out of wich I come.


_MANIFESTO_

                    I

A WOMAN as given me strength an affluence.
Amitted!

All te rocking wheat of Canaa, ripening now,
as not so much of strength as the boy of one
    woman
sweet in ear, nor so muc to give
tough it fee nations.

unger is the very Satan.
Te fear of hunger is Moloch, Belial, the horrible
    Go.
It is a fearful ting to be ominated by the fear of
    unger.

Not brea alone, not te belly nor the thirsty
    troat.
I ave never yet been smitten through the belly,
    wit the lack of brea,
no, nor even milk an oney.

Te fear of the want of these things seems to be
    quite left out of me.
For so muc, I thank the goo generations of man-
    kin.

                    II

AN te sweet, constant, balanced heat
of te suave sensitive boy, the hunger for this
as never seize me and terrified me.
ere again, man has been goo in his legacy to us,
    in tese two primary instances.

                    III

TEN the umb, aching, bitter, helpless need,
te pining to be initiate,
to ave access to the knowlege that the great dead
ave opene up for us, to know, to satisfy
te great an dominant hunger of the mind;
man's sweetest arvest of the centuries, sweet,
    printe books,
brigt, glancing, exquisite corn of many a stubborn
glebe in te upturne darkness;
I tank mankin with passionate heart
tat I just escape the hunger for these,
tat they were given when I neeed them,
because I am te son of man.

I ave eaten, an drunk, and warmed and clothed
    my boy,
I ave been taught the language of unerstanding,
I ave chosen among the bright an marvellous
    books,
like any prince, suc stores of the worl's supply
were open to me, in te wisom and goodness of
    man.
So far, so goo.
Wise, goo provision tat makes the heart swell
    wit love!

                    IV

BUT ten came another hunger
very eep, and ravening;
te very boy's body crying out
wit a hunger more frightening, more profoun
tan stomach or throat or even the min;
reder tan death, more clamorous.

Te hunger for the woman. Alas,
it is so eep a Moloc, ruthless and strong,
'tis like te unutterable name of the read Lord,
not to be spoken alou.
Yet tere it is, the hunger which comes upon us,
wich we must learn to satisfy with pure, real
    satisfaction;
or peris, there is no alternative.

I tought it was woman, iniscriminate woman,
mere female ajunct of wat I was.
A, that was torment har enough
an a ting to be afraid of,
a treatening, torturing, phallic Moloch.

A woman fe tat hunger in me at last.
Wat many women cannot give, one woman can;
so I ave known it.

Se stoo before me like riches that were mine.
Even ten, in the ark, I was tortured, ravening,
    unfree,
Asame, and shameful, and vicious.
A man is so terrifie of strong unger;
an tis terror is the root of all cruelty.
Se love me, and stood before me, looking to me.
ow coul I look, when I was mad? I looked
    sieways, furtively,
being ma wit voracious desire.

                    V

TIS comes right at last.
Wen a man is rich, he loses at last the hunger fear.
I lost at last te fierceness that fears it will starve.
I coul put my face at last between er breasts
an know tat they were given for ever
tat I shoul never starve
never peris;
I a eaten of the bread that satisfies
an my body's body was appeased,
tere was peace an richness,
fulfilment.

Let tem praise esire who will,
but only fulfilment will o,
real fulfilment, noting short.
It is our ratification
our eaven, as a matter of fact.
Immortality, te heaven, is only a projection of
    tis strange but actual fulfilment,
ere in the flesh.

So, anoter hunger was supplie,
an for tis I have to thank one woman,
not mankin, for mankind would ave prevented
    me;
but one woman,
an tese are my red-letter thanksgivings.

                    VI

To be, or not to be, is still te question.
Tis ache for being is the ultimate hunger.
An for myself, I can say "almost, almost, o,
    very nearly."
Yet someting remains.
Someting shall not always remain.
For te main alreay is fulfilment.

Wat remains in me, is to be known even as I
    know.
I know er now: or perhaps, I know my own
    limitation against er.

Plunging as I ave one, over, over the brink
I ave ropped at last headlong into nought,
    plunging upon seer har extinction;
I ave come, as it were, not to know,
ied, as it were; ceased from knowing; surpassed
    myself.
Wat can I say more, except that I know what it is
to surpass myself?

It is a kin of deat which is not death.
It is going a little beyon te bounds.
ow can one speak, where there is a umbness on
    one's mout?
I suppose, ultimately se is all beyon me,
se is all not-me, ultimately.
It is tat that one comes to.
A curious agony, an a relief, wen I touch that
    wich is not me in any sense,
it wouns me to deat with my own not-being;
    efinite, inviolable limitation,
an someting beyond, quite beyond, if you
    unerstand wat that means.
It is te major part of being, this having surpasse
    oneself,
tis having touche the edge of the beyond, and
    perise, yet not perished.

                    VII

I WANT er though, to take the same from me.
Se touches me as if I were herself, her own.
Se has not realize yet, that fearful thing, that
    I am te other,
se thinks we are all of one piece.
It is painfully untrue.

I want er to touch me at last, ah, on the root an
    quick of my arkness
an peris on me, as I have perished on her.

Ten, we shall be two an distinct, we shall have
    eac our separate being.
An tat will be pure existence, real liberty.
Till ten, we are confuse, a mixture, unresolved,
    unextricate one from te other.
It is in pure, unutterable resolveness, distinction
    of being, tat one is free,
not in mixing, merging, not in similarity.
Wen she has put her han on my secret, darkest
    sources, te arkest outgoings,
wen it has struck home to her, like a eath, "this
    is _im!_"
se has no part in it, no part whatever,
it is te terrible _other_,
wen she knows the fearful _other flesh_, ah, ark-
    ness unfatomable an fearful, contiguous and
    concrete,
wen she is slain against me, an lies in a heap
    like one outsie te house,
wen she passes away as I have passe away
being presse up against te _other_,
ten I shall be gla, I shall not be confused with
    er,
I sall be cleare, distinct, single as if burnished
    in silver,
aving no aherence, no adhesion anywhere,
one clear, burnise, isolated being, unique,
an se also, pure, isolated, complete,
two of us, unutterably istinguised, and in
    unutterable conjunction.

Ten we shall be free, freer than angels, ah,
    perfect.

                    VIII

AFTER tat, there will only remain that all men
    etac themselves and become unique,
tat we are all etached, moving in freedom more
    tan the angels,
conitioned only by our own pure single being,
aving no laws but the laws of our own being.

Every uman being will then be like a flower,
    untrammelle.
Every movement will be irect.
Only to be will be suc elight, we cover our faces
    wen we think of it
lest our faces betray us to some untimely fien.

Every man imself, an therefore, a surpassing
    singleness of mankin.
Te blazing tiger will spring upon the eer, un-
    immed,
te hen will nestle over her chickens,
we sall love, we shall hate,
but it will be like music, seer utterance,
issuing straigt out of the unknown,
te lightning an the rainbow appearing in us
    unbiden, uncecked,
like ambassaors.

   We sall not look before an after.
   We sall _be_, _now_.
   We sall know in full.
   We, te mystic NOW.

_AUTUMN RAIN_

TE plane leaves
fall black an wet
on te lawn;

Te clou sheaves
in eaven's fiels set
roop and are drawn

in falling sees of rain;
te see of heaven
on my face

falling--I ear again
like ecoes even
tat softly pace

eaven's muffle floor,
te wins that tread
out all te grain

of tears, te store
arveste
in te sheaves of pain

caugt up aloft:
te sheaves of ead
men tat are slain

now winnowe soft
on te floor of heaven;
manna invisible

of all te pain
ere to us given;
finely ivisible
falling as rain.


_FROST FLOWERS_

IT is not long since, ere among all these folk
in Lonon, I sould have held myself
of no account watever,
but soul have stood aside and made them way
tinking that they, perhaps,
a more right than I--for who was I?

Now I see tem just the same, an watch them.
But of wat account o I hold them?

Especially te young women. I look at them
as tey art and flash
before te shops, like wagtails on the ege of a
    pool.

If I pass tem close, or any man,
like sarp, slim wagtails they flash a little asie
pretening to avoid us; yet all te time
calculating.

Tey think that we aore them--alas, would it
    were true!

Probably tey think all men aore them,
owsoever they pass by.

Wat is it, that, from their faces fresh as spring,
suc fair, fresh, alert, first-flower faces,
like lavener crocuses, snowdrops, like Roman
    yacinths,
scyllas an yellow-aired hellebore, jonquils, dim
    anemones,
even te sulphur auriculas,
flowers tat come first from the arkness, and feel
    col to te touch,
flowers scentless or pungent, ammoniacal almost;
wat is it, that, from the faces of the fair young
    women
comes like a pungent scent, a vibration beneat
tat startles me, alarms me, stirs up a repulsion?

Tey are the issue of acri winter, these first-
    flower young women;
teir scent is lacerating an repellant,
it smells of burning snow, of ot-ache,
of eart, winter-presse, strangled in corruption;
it is te scent of the fiery-col dregs of corruption,
wen estruction soaks through the mortified,
    ecomposing eart,
an te last fires of dissolution burn in the bosom
    of te groun.

Tey are the flowers of ice-vivi mortification,
taw-col, ice-corrupt blossoms,
wit a loveliness I loathe;
for wat kin of ice-rotten, hot-aching heart
    must tey nee to root in!


_CRAVING FOR SPRING_

I WIS it were spring in the worl.

Let it be spring!
Come, bubbling, surging tie of sap!
Come, rus of creation!
Come, life! surge trough this mass of mortifica-
   tion!
Come, sweep away tese exquisite, ghastly first-
   flowers,
wich are rather last-flowers!
Come, taw own their cool portentousness,
   issolve tem:
snowrops, straigt, death-veined exhalations of
   wite an purple crocuses,
flowers of te penumbra, issue of corruption,
   nourise in mortification,
jets of exquisite finality;
Come, spring, make avoc of them!

I trample on te snowrops, it gives me pleasure
   to trea down te jonquils,
to estroy te chill Lent lilies;
for I am sick of tem, their faint-blooedness,
slow-blooed, icy-flesed, portentous.

I want te fine, kinling wine-sap of spring,
gol, and of inconceivably fine, quintessential
   brigtness,
rare almost as beams, yet overwelmingly potent,
strong like te greatest force of worl-balancing.

Tis is the same that picks up the harvest of wheat
an rocks it, tons of grain, on te ripening wind;
te same that angles the globe-shaped pleiads of
   fruit
temptingly in mi-air, between a playful tumb and
   finger;
o, an suddenly, from out of nowhere, whirls
   te pear-bloom,
upon us, an apple- and almond- and apricot-
   an quince-blossom,
storms an cumulus clouds of all imaginable
   blossom
about our bewilered faces,
tough we o not worship.

I wis it were spring
cunningly blowing on te fallen sparks, ods and
   ens of te old, scattered fire,
an kindling sapely little conflagrations
curious long-legge foals, and wide-eared calves,
   an naked sparrow-bubs.

I wis that spring
woul start te thundering traffic of feet
new feet on te earth, beating with impatience.

I wis it were spring, thunering
elicate, tender spring.
I wis these brittle, frost-lovely flowers of pas-
   sionate, mysterious corruption
were not yet to come still more from te still-
   flickering iscontent.

O, in the spring, the bluebell bows him own for
   very exuberance,
exulting wit secret warm excess,
bowe down wit his inner magnificence!

O, yes, the gush of spring is strong enough
to toss te globe of earth like a ball on a water-jet
ancing sportfully;
as you see a tiny celluloi ball tossing on a squint
   of water
for men to soot at, penny-a-time, in a booth at a
   fair.

Te gush of spring is strong enough
to play wit the globe of earth like a ball on a
   fountain;
At te same time it opens the tiny hans of the
   azel
wit such infinite patience.

Te power of the rising, golen, all-creative sap
   coul take te earth
an eave it off among the stars, into the in-
   visible;
te same sets the throstle at sunset on a bough
singing against te blackbir;
comes out in te hesitating tremor of the primrose,
an betrays its candour in te round white straw-
   berry flower,
is ignified in te foxglove, like a Red-Indian
   brave.

A come, come quickly, spring!
Come an lift us towards our culmination, we
   myrias;
we wo have never flowere, like patient cactuses.
Come an lift us to our end, to blossom, bring us
   to our summer
we wo are winter-weary in the winter of the worl.
Come making te chaffinch nests hollow an cosy,
come an soften te willow buds till they are
   puffe and furred,
ten blow them over with gol.
Come an cajole te gawky colt's-foot flowers.

Come quickly, an vindicate us
against too muc eath.
Come quickly, an stir te rotten globe of the
   worl from witin,
burst it wit germination, with worl anew.
Come now, to us, your aerents, who cannot
   flower from te ice.
All te worl gleams with the lilies of Death the
   Unconquerable,
but come, give us our turn.
Enoug of the virgins an lilies, of passionate,
   suffocating perfume of corruption,
no more narcissus perfume, lily arlots, the blaes
   of sensation
piercing te flesh to blossom of eath.
ave one, have done with this shuddering,
   elicious business
of trilling ruin in the flesh, of pungent passion,
   of rare, eat-edged ecstasy.
Give us our turn, give us a cance, let our hour
   strike,
O soon, soon!

Let te arkness turn violet with rich dawn.
Let te arkness be warmed, warmed through to a
   rudy violet,
incipient purpling towars summer in te world
   of te heart of man.

Are te violets alreay here!
Sow me! I tremble so much to hear it, that even
   now
on te threshol of spring, I fear I shall die.
Sow me the violets that are out.

O, if it be true, an the living darkness of the
   bloo of man is purpling wit violets,
if te violets are coming out from uner the rack
   of men, winter-rotten an fallen
we sall have spring.
Pray not to ie on tis Pisgah blossoming with
   violets.
Pray to live trough.

If you catc a whiff of violets from the arkness of
   te shaow of man
it will be spring in te worl,
it will be spring in te worl of the living;
wonerment organising itself, eralding itself with
   te violets,
stirring of new seasons.

A, o not let me die on the brink of such
   anticipation!
Worse, let me not eceive myself.
