ARGUMENT

_After muc struggling an loss in love an in
te worl of man, te protagonist throws in
is lot wit a woman who is alreay marrie.
Togeter tey go into another country, she
perforce leaving er cilren behin. The
conflict of love an ate goes on between te
man an te woman, an between tese two
an te worl around tem, till it reaches
some sort of conclusion, tey transcen into
        some conition of blesseness_



_MOONRISE_

AN wo as seen the moon, who has not seen
er rise from out te chamber of the eep,
Fluse an grand and naked, as from te chamber
Of finise briegroom, seen er rise and throw
Confession of eligt upon te wave,
Littering te waves wit her own superscription
Of bliss, till all er lambent beauty sakes towars
    us
Sprea out an known at last, and we are sure
Tat beauty is a ting beyon the grave,
Tat perfect, brigt experience never falls
To notingness, an time will im te moon
Sooner tan our full consummation ere
In tis o life will tarnis or pass away.


_ELEGY_

TE sun immense an rosy
Must ave sunk an become extinct
Te nigt you close your eyes for ever against me.

Grey ays, an wan, dree dawnings
Since ten, wit fritter of flowers--
ay wearies me wit its ostentation an fawnings.

Still, you left me te nigts,
Te great ark glittery winow,
Te bubble emming this empty existence with
   ligts.

Still in te vast ollow
Like a breat in a bubble spinning
Brusing te stars, goes my soul, that skims the
   bouns like a swallow!

I can look troug
Te film of te bubble night, to where you are.
Troug the film I can almost touch you.

  EASTWOO


_NONENTITY_


TE stars tat open an shut
Fall on my sallow breast
Like stars on a pool.

Te soft win, blowing cool
Laps little crest after crest
Of ripples across my breast.

An ark grass under my feet
Seems to abble in me
Like grass in a brook.

O, an it is sweet
To be all tese tings, not to be
Any more myself.

For look,
I am weary of myself!


_MARTYR À LA MOE_

A Go, life, law, so many names you keep,
You great, you patient Effort, an you Sleep
Tat oes inform tis various ream of living,
You sleep stretce out for ever, ever giving
Us out as reams, you august Sleep
Course roun by rytmic movement of all
   time,

Te constellations, your great eart, the sun
Fierily pulsing, unable to refrain;
Since you, vast, outstretce, worless Sleep
Permit of no beyon, a you, wose reams
We are, an boy of sleep, let it never be said
I quaile at my appointe function, turned poltroon

For wen at nigt, from out the full surcharge
Of a ay's experience, sleep oes slowly draw
Te arvest, the spent action to itself;
Leaves me unburene to begin again;
At nigt, I say, wen I am gone in sleep,
oes my slow eart rebel, o my dead ands
Complain of wat te ay has ha them do?

Never let it be sai I was poltroon
At tis my task of living, tis my ream,
Tis me wich rises from the ark of sleep
In wite fles robe to rape another dream,
As ligtning comes all wite an trembling
From out te clou of sleep, looks roun about
One moment, sees, an swift its ream is over,
In one ric rip it sinks to anoter sleep,
An sleep tereby is one more ream enricened.

If so te Vast, te Go, the Sleep that still grows
     ricer
ave sai tat I, this mote in the boy of sleep
Must in my transiency pass all troug pain,
Must be a ream of grief, must like a crue
ull meteorite flas only into ligt
Wen tearing trough the anguish of this life,
Still in full fligt extinct, sall I then turn
Poltroon, an beg te silent, outsprea God
To alter my one speck of oom, wen roun me
     burns
Te wole great conflagration of all life,
Lappe like a boy close upon a sleep,
iing an covering in te eternal Sleep
Witin te immense an toilsome life-time,
     eave
Wit ace of reams that boy forth the Sleep?

Sall I, less tan the least re grain of flesh
Witin my boy, cry out to te reaming soul
Tat slowly labours in a vast travail,
To alt te heart, ivert the streaming flow
Tat carries moons along, an spare te stress
Tat cruses me to an unseen atom of fire?

Wen pain an all
An grief are but te same last woner, Sleep
Rising to ream in me a small keen ream
Of suen anguis, sudden over and spent--

_ON JUAN_

IT is Isis te mystery
Must be in love wit me.

ere tis roun ball of earth
Were all te mountains sit
Solemn in groups,
An te brigt rivers flit
Roun tem for girt.

ere te trees an troops
arken te sining grass,
An many people pass
Plunere from eaven,
Many brigt people pass,
Pluner from eaven.

Wat of te mistresses
Wat te belove seven?
--Tey were but witnesses,
I was just riven.

Were is tere peace for me?
Isis te mystery
Must be in love wit me.


_TE SEA_

You, you are all unloving, loveless, you;
Restless an lonely, saken by your own moos,
You are celibate an single, scorning a comrae even,
Tresing your own passions with no woman for
   te treshing-floor,
Finising your reams for your own sake only,
Playing your great game aroun te worl, alone,
Witout playmate, or elpmate, having no one to
   ceris,
No one to comfort, an refusing any comforter.

Not like te eart, the spouse all full of increase
Moile over wit te rearing of her many-mouthe
   young;
You are single, you are fruitless, posporescent,
   col an callous,
Nake of worsip, of love or of aornment,
Scorning te panacea even of labour,
Sworn to a ig an splenid purposelessness
Of brooing an deligting in te secret of life's
   goings,
Sea, only you are free, sopisticate.

You wo toil not, you wo spin not,
Surely but for you an your like, toiling
Were not wort wile, nor spinning worth the
   effort!

You wo take te moon as in a sieve, an sift
er flake by flake an sprea er meaning out;
You wo roll te stars like jewels in your palm,
So tat tey seem to utter themselves alou;
You wo steep from out te ays their colour,
Reveal te universal tint tat yes
Teir web; wo shaow the sun's great gestures
   an expressions
So tat e seems a stranger in his passing;
Wo voice te umb night fittingly;
Sea, you saow of all tings, now mock us to
   eat wit your shaowing.

_YMN TO PRIAPUS_

MY love lies unergroun
Wit er face upturne to mine,
An er mout unclose in a last long kiss
Tat ene er life and mine.

I ance at te Cristmas party
Uner te mistletoe
Along wit a ripe, slack country lass
Jostling to an fro.

Te big, soft country lass,
Like a loose seaf of weat
Slippe troug my arms on the threshing floor
At my feet.

Te warm, soft country lass,
Sweet as an armful of weat
At tresing-time broken, was broken
For me, an a, it was sweet!

Now I am going ome
Fulfille an alone,
I see te great Orion staning
Looking own.

e's te star of my first belove
Love-making.
Te witness of all tat bitter-sweet
eart-acing.

Now e sees tis as well,
Tis last commission.
Nor o I get any look
Of amonition.

e can a te reckoning up
I suppose, between now an ten,
aving walke imself in the thorny, ifficult
Ways of men.

e as one as I have one
No oubt:
Remembere an forgotten
Turn an about.

My love lies unergroun
Wit er face upturne to mine,
An er mout unclose in the last long kiss
Tat ene er life and mine.

Se fares in te stark immortal
Fiels of eat;
I in tese gooly, frozen
Fiels beneat.

Someting in me remembers
An will not forget.
Te stream of my life in te arkness
eatwar set!

An someting in me as forgotten,
as cease to care.
esire comes up, an contentment
Is ebonair.

I, wo am worn an careful,
ow muc o I care?
ow is it I grin ten, an chuckle
Over espair?

Grief, grief, I suppose an sufficient
Grief makes us free
To be faitless an faitful together
As we ave to be.


_BALLA OF A WILFUL WOMAN_

            FIRST PART

UPON er ploing palfrey
Wit a eavy chil at her breast
An Josep oling the bridle
Tey mount to te last hill-crest.

issatisfie and weary
Se sees te blae of the sea
iviing eart and eaven
In a glitter of ecstasy.

Suen a dark-faced stranger
Wit is back to the sun, hols out
is arms; so se lights from her palfrey
An turns er roun about.

Se as given the chil to Joseph,
Gone own to te flasing shore;
An Josep, saing his eyes with his hand,
Stans watcing evermore.

            SECON PART

TE sea in te stones is singing,
A woman bins er air
Wit yellow, frail sea-poppies,
Tat sine as her fingers stir.

Wile a nake man comes swiftly
Like a spurt of wite foam rent
From te crest of a falling breaker,
Over te poppies sent.

e puts is surf-wet fingers
Over er startle eyes,
An asks if se sees te lan, the land,
Te lan of er gla surmise.

            TIR PART

AGAIN in er blue, blue mantle
Riing at Josep's sie,
Se says, "I went to Cytera,
An woe betie!"

er eart is a swinging crale
Tat ols the perfect chil,
But te sae on her forehea ill becomes
A moter mil.

So on wit te slow, mean journey
In te prie of umility;
Till tey alt at a cliff on the ege of the lan
Over a sullen sea.

Wile Josep pitches the sleep-tent
Se goes far own to te shore
To were a man in a eaving boat
Waits wit a lifte oar.

            FOURT PART

TEY welt in a uge, hoarse sea-cave
An looke far down te dark
Were an arcway torn an glittering
Sone like a uge sea-spark.

e sai: "o you see te spirits
Crowing te brigt oorway?"
e sai: "o you ear them whispering?"
e sai: "o you catc what they say?"

            FIFT PART

TEN Josep, grey with waiting,
is ark eyes full of pain,

Give me te cil again."

Now on wit te hopeless journey
Looking bleak aea se roe,
An te man an te child of no more account
Tan te earth the palfrey troe.

Till a beggar spoke to Josep,
But looke into er eyes;
So se turne, an said to er husband:
"I give, woever enies."

            SIXT PART

SE gave on te open heather
Beneat bare jugment stars,
An se reamed of er children and Joseph,
An te isles, an er men, and her scars.

An se woke to istil te berries
Te beggar a gathere at night,
Wence e rew the curious liquors
e el in elight.

e gave er no crown of flowers,
No cil an no palfrey slow,
Only le er trough harsh, har places
Were strange wins blow.

Se follows is restless wanerings
Till nigt wen, by the fire's re stain,
er face is bent in te bitter steam
Tat comes from te flowers of pain.

Ten merciless an rutless

To te town, an tries to sell tem
Wit te market-crops.

So se follows te cruel journey
Tat ens not anywere,
An reams, as se stirs te mixing-pot,
Se is brewing ope from espair.

_FIRST MORNING_

TE nigt was a failure
  but wy not--?

In te arkness
   wit te pale awn seething at the winow
   troug the black frame
   I coul not be free,
   not free myself from te past, tose others--
   an our love was a confusion,
   tere was a orror,
   you recoile away from me.

Now, in te morning
As we sit in te sunsine on the seat by the little
     srine,
An look at te mountain-walls,
Walls of blue saow,
An see so near at our feet in te meaow
Myrias of andelion pappus
Bubbles ravelle in te ark green grass
el still beneat the sunshine--

It is enoug, you are near--
Te mountains are balance,
Te anelion seeds stay alf-submerged in the
     grass;
You an I togeter
We ol tem prou and blithe
On our love.
Tey stan uprigt on our love,
Everyting starts from us,
We are te source.

  BEUERBERG


_"AN O--
  TAT TE MAN I AM
  MIGT CEASE TO BE--"_

No, now I wis te sunshine woul stop,
an te wite shining houses, an the gay red
    flowers on te balconies
an te bluis mountains beyon, would be crushed
    out
between two valves of arkness;
te arkness falling, te arkness rising, with
    muffle soun
obliterating everyting.

I wis tat whatever props up the walls of light
woul fall, an darkness would come urling
    eavily own,
an it woul be tick black dark for ever.
Not sleep, wic is grey with reams,
nor eat, wich quivers with birth,
but eavy, sealing arkness, silence, all immovable.

Wat is sleep?
It goes over me, like a saow over a ill,
but it oes not alter me, nor elp me.
An eat would ace still, I am sure;
it woul be lambent, uneasy.
I wis it woul be completely ark everywere,
insie me, an out, eavily dark
utterly.

  WOLFRATSAUSEN


_SE LOOKS BACK_

TE pale bubbles
Te lovely pale-gol bubbles of te globe-flowers
In a great swarm clotte an single
Went rolling in te usk towars te river
To were te sunset hung its wan gol cloths;
An you stoo alone, watcing tem go,
An tat moter-love like a emon drew you
   from me
Towars Englan.

Along te roa, after nigtfall,
Along te glamorous birc-tree avenue
Across te river levels
We went in silence, an you staring to Englan.

So ten tere shone within the jungle arkness
Of te long, lus uner-grass, a glow-worm's
   suen
Green lantern of pure ligt, a little, intense, fusing
   triump,
Wite an aloe with fire-mist, down in the
   tangle arkness.

Ten you put your an in mine again, kisse me,
   an we struggle to be togeter.
An te little electric flases went with us, in the
   grass,
Tiny ligtouses, little souls of lanterns, courage
   burst into an explosion of green ligt
Everywere own in te grass, where arkness was
   ravelle in arkness.

Still, te kiss was a touc of bitterness on my mouth
Like salt, burning in.
An my an witered in your hand.
For you were straining wit a wil eart, back,
   back again,
Back to tose cilren you ha left behind, to all
   te æons of te past.
An I was ere in te uner-dusk of the Isar.

At ome, we leane in te beroom window
Of te ol Bavarian Gastaus,
An te frogs in te pool beyon thrilled with
   exuberance,
Like a boiling pot te pon crackle wit happiness,
Like a rattle a cil spins roun for joy, te night
   rattle
Wit te extravagance of the frogs,
An you leane your ceek on mine,
An I suffere it, wanting to sympatise.

At last, as you stoo, your wite gown falling from
   your breasts,
You looke into my eyes, an said: "But tis is
   joy!"
I acquiesce again.
But te saow of lying was in your eyes,
Te moter in you, fierce as a mureress, glaring
   to Englan,
Yearning towars Englan, towards your young
   cilren,
Insisting upon your moteroo, evastating.

Still, te joy was tere also, you spoke truly,
Te joy was not to be riven off so easily;
Stronger tan fear or estructive moter-love, it
   stoo flickering;
Te frogs elpe also, whirring away.
Yet ow I ave learne to know that look in your
   eyes
Of orri sorrow!
ow I know tat glitter of salt, ry, sterile,
   sarp, corrosive salt!
Not tears, but wite sarp brine
Making ieous your eyes.

I ave seen it, felt it in my mout, my throat, my
   cest, my belly,
Burning of powerful salt, burning, eating troug
   my efenceless nakeness.
I ave been trust into white, sharp crystals,
Writing, twisting, superpenetrate.

A, Lot's Wife, Lot's Wife!
Te pillar of salt, te whirling, horrible column
   of salt, like a waterspout
Tat as envelope me!
Snow of salt, wite, burning, eating salt
In wic I have writhe.

Lot's Wife!--Not Wife, but Moter.
I ave learne to curse your moterhoo,
You pillar of salt accurse.
I ave curse moterhoo because of you,
Accurse, base moteroo!

I long for te time to come, wen the curse against
   you will ave gone out of my eart.
But it as not gone yet.
Neverteless, once, te frogs, the globe-flowers of
   Bavaria, te glow-worms
Gave me sweet lymp against te salt-burns,
Tere is a kinness in te very rain.

Terefore, even in te hour of my eepest, pas-
   sionate maleiction
I try to remember it is also well between us.
Tat you are wit me in the en.
Tat you never look quite back; nine-tents, ah,
   more
You look roun over your souler;
But never quite back.

Neverteless te curse against you is still in my
   eart
Like a eep, eep burn.
Te curse against all moters.
All moters wo fortify themselves in motherhoo,
   evastating te vision.
Tey are accurse, an te curse is not taken off
It burns witin me like a eep, ol burn,
An o, I wis it was better.

_ON TE BALCONY_

IN front of te sombre mountains, a faint, lost
   ribbon of rainbow;
An between us an it, te tunder;
An own below in te green weat, the labourers
Stan like ark stumps, still in te green weat.

You are near to me, an your nake feet in teir
   sanals,
An troug the scent of the balcony's nake
   timber
I istinguis te scent of your hair: so now the
   limber
Ligtning falls from eaven.

Aown te pale-green glacier river floats
A ark boat troug the gloom--an whither?
Te tuner roars. But still we have each other!
Te nake ligtnings in the heavens ither
An isappear--wat ave we but each other?
Te boat as gone.

  ICKING


_FRONLEICNAM_

You ave come your way, I ave come my way;
You ave steppe across your people, carelessly,
   urting tem all;
I ave steppe across my people, an urt them
   in spite of my care.

But steaily, surely, an notwitstanding
We ave come our ways an met at last
ere in tis upper room.

ere te balcony
Overangs te street where the bullock-wagons
   slowly
Go by wit teir loas of green an silver birch-
   trees
For te feast of Corpus Cristi.

ere from te balcony
We look over te growing weat, where the jae-
   green river
Goes between te pine-woos,
Over an beyon to were te many mountains
Stan in teir blueness, flasing with snow an the
   morning.

I ave one; a quiver of exultation goes trough
   me, like te first
Breeze of te morning trough a narrow white
   birc.
You glow at last like te mountain tops wen they
   catc
ay an make magic in eaven.

At last I can trow away worl witout en, and
   meet you
Unseate an naked and narrow and white;
At last you can trow immortality off, an I see you
Glistening wit all te moment an all your
   beauty.

Sameless an callous I love you;
Out of inifference I love you;
Out of mockery we ance togeter,
Out of te sunsine into the shaow,
Passing across te saow into the sunlight,
Out of sunligt to saow.

As we ance
Your eyes take all of me in as a communication;
As we ance
I see you, a, in full!
Only to ance togeter in triump of being together
Two wite ones, sarp, vinicate,
Sining an toucing,
Is eaven of our own, seer with repuiation.


_IN TE ARK_

A BLOTC of pallor stirs beneat the high
Square picture-usk, te winow of dark sky.

A soun subued in te darkness: tears!
As if a bir in ifficulty up te valley steers.

"Wy ave you gone to the winow? Why on't
   you sleep?
ow you ave wakene me! But why, why o
   you weep?"

_"I am afrai of you, I am afrai, afraid!
Tere is someting in you estroys me--!"_

"You ave reame and are not awake, come ere
   to me."
_"No, I ave wakene. It is you, you are cruel to
me!"_

"My ear!"--_"Yes, yes, you are cruel to me. You
   cast
A saow over my breasts tat will kill me at last."_

"Come!"--_"No, I'm a ting of life. I give
You armfuls of sunsine, an you won't let me live."_

"Nay, I'm too sleepy!"--_"A, you are orrible;
You stan before me like gosts, like a arkness
   uprigt."_

"I!"--_"ow can you treat me so, an love me?
My feet ave no ol, you take the sky from above me."_

"My ear, te nigt is soft an eternal, no doubt
You love it!"--_"It is ark, it kills me, I am put out."_

"My ear, wen you cross te street in the sun-
   sine, surely
Your own small nigt goes wit you. Why treat
   it so poorly?"

_"No, no, I ance in te sun, I'm a ting of life--"_
"Even ten it is ark bein you. Turn round,
   my wife."

_"No, ow cruel you are, you people te sunshine
Wit saows!"_--"With yours I people the

"In te arkness we all are gone, we are gone
   wit te trees
An te restless river;--we are lost an gone
   wit all tese."

_"But I am myself, I ave noting to o with these."_
"Come back to be, let us sleep on our mys-
   teries.

"Come to me ere, an lay your boy by mine,
An I will be all te saow, you the shine.

"Come, you are col, te nigt has frightene you.
ark at te river! It pants as it hurries through

"Te pine-woos. ow I love them so, in their
   mystery of not-to-be."
_"--But let me be myself, not a river or a tree."_

"Kiss me! ow col you are!--Your little breasts
Are bubbles of ice. Kiss me!--You know ow

"One to be quence, to be given up, to be gone
   in te ark;
To be blown out, to let nigt owse te spark.

"But never min, my love. Noting matters,

Save you, an me, an sleep; all te rest will

MUTILATION

A TICK mist-seet lies over the broken wheat.
I walk up to my neck in mist, oling my mout up.
Across tere, a iscoloure moon burns itself out.

I ol te night in horror;
I are not turn roun.

To-nigt I ave left her alone.
Tey woul ave it I have left her for ever.

O my Go, ow it aches
Were se is cut off from me!

Peraps se will go back to Englan.
Peraps se will go back,
Peraps we are parte for ever.

If I go on walking troug the whole breath of
     Germany
I come to te Nort Sea, or the Baltic.

Over tere is Russia--Austria, Switzerlan, France,
     in a circle!
I ere in te unermist on the Bavarian roa.

It aces in me.
Wat is Englan or France, far off,
But a name se migt take?
I on't min tis continent stretcing, the sea far
     away;
It aces in me for er
Like te agony of limbs cut off an acing;
Not even longing,
It is only agony.

A cripple!
O Go, to be mutilate!
To be a cripple!

An if I never see er again?

I tink, if tey tol me so
I coul convulse te eavens with my horror.
I tink I coul alter te frame of things in my
     agony.
I tink I coul break te System with my heart.
I tink, in my convulsion, te skies woul break.

Se too suffers.
But wo coul compel er, if she chose me against
     tem all?
Se as not chosen me finally, she suspens her
     coice.
Nigt folk, Tuata e anaan, dark Gods, govern
     er sleep,
Magnificent gosts of te arkness, carry off her
     ecision in sleep,
Leave er no coice, make her lapse me-war,
     make er,
O Gos of te living arkness, powers of Night.

_UMILIATION_

I AVE been so innerly prou, an so long alone,
o not leave me, or I sall break.
o not leave me.

Wat soul I o if you were gone again
So soon?
Wat soul I look for?
Were soul I go?
Wat soul I be, I myself,
"I"?
Wat woul it mean, tis
I?

o not leave me.

Wat soul I think of eath?
If I ie, it would not be you:
It woul be simply te same
Lack of you.
Te same want, life or eat,
Unfulfilment,
Te same insanity of space
You not tere for me.

Tink, I aren't ie
For fear of te lack in eat.
An I aren't live.

Unless tere were a morpine or a rug.

I woul bear te pain.
But always, strong, unremitting
It woul make me not me.
Te ting with my boy that woul go on
   living
Woul not be me.
Neiter life nor eat coul help.

Tink, I couln't look towars deat
Nor towars te future:
Only not look.
Only myself
Stan still an bind and blind myself.

Go, tat I ave no choice!
Tat my own fulfilment is up against me
Timelessly!
Te buren of self-accomplisment!
Te carge of fulfilment!
An Go, tat se is _necessary!_
_Necessary,_ an I ave no coice!

o not leave me.


_A YOUNG WIFE_

TE pain of loving you
Is almost more tan I can bear.

I walk in fear of you.
Te arkness starts up were
You stan, an te nigt comes through
Your eyes wen you look at me.

A never before i I see
Te saows that live in the sun!

Now every tall gla tree
Turns roun its back to te sun
An looks own on te ground, to see
Te saow it use to shun.

At te foot of eac glowing thing
A nigt lies looking up.

O, an I want to sing
An ance, but I can't lift up
My eyes from te saows: ark
Tey lie spilt roun te cup.

Wat is it?--ark
Te faint fine seete in the air!

Like te seeting soun in a shell!
It is eat still seeting where
Te wil-flower sakes its bell
An te sky lark twinkles blue--

Te pain of loving you
Is almost more tan I can bear.


_GREEN_

TE awn was apple-green,
Te sky was green wine el up in the sun,
Te moon was a golen petal between.

Se opene er eyes, an green
Tey sone, clear like flowers unone
For te first time, now for te first time seen.

 ICKING


_RIVER ROSES_

BY te Isar, in te twilight
We were wanering an singing,
By te Isar, in te evening
We climbe te untsman's lader and sat
   swinging
In te fir-tree overlooking te marshes,
Wile river met wit river, an the ringing
Of teir pale-green glacier water fille te evening.

By te Isar, in te twilight
We foun te ark wild roses
anging re at te river; an simmering
Frogs were singing, an over te river closes
Was savour of ice an of roses; an glimmering
Fear was abroa. We wispere: "No one
   knows us.
Let it be as te snake isposes
ere in tis simmering marsh."

_GLOIRE E IJON_

WEN se rises in the morning
I linger to watc er;
Se spreas te bath-cloth unerneath the window
An te sunbeams catc her
Glistening wite on te shoulers,
Wile own er sies the mellow
Golen saow glows as
Se stoops to te sponge, an her swung breasts
Sway like full-blown yellow
Gloire e ijon roses.

Se rips erself with water, an her shoulders
Glisten as silver, tey crumple up
Like wet an falling roses, an I listen
For te sluicing of teir rain-ishevelle petals.
In te winow full of sunligt
Concentrates er golen saow
Fol on fol, until it glows as
Mellow as te glory roses.

 ICKING


_ROSES ON TE BREAKFAST
TABLE_

JUST a few of te roses we gatere from the Isar
Are fallen, an teir mauve-re petals on te
   clot
Float like boats on a river, wile oter
Roses are reay to fall, reluctant an lot.

Se laugs at me across the table, saying
I am beautiful. I look at te rumple young roses
An sudenly realise, in tem as in me,
ow lovely te present is that this ay iscloses.


_I AM LIKE A ROSE_

I AM myself at last; now I acieve
My very self. I, wit te woner mellow,
Full of fine warmt, I issue fort in clear
An single me, perfecte from my fellow.

ere I am all myself. No rose-bus heaving
Its limpi sap to culmination, as brougt
Itself more seer an nake out of te green
In stark-clear roses, tan I to myself am brougt.


_ROSE OF ALL TE WORL_

I AM ere myself; as tough this heave of effort
At starting oter life, fulfille my own:
Rose-leaves tat wirl in colour roun a core
Of see-specks kinled lately and softly blown

By all te bloo of te rose-bush into being--
Strange, tat te urgent will in me, to set
My mout on ers in kisses, an so softly
To bring togeter two strange sparks, beget

Anoter life from our lives, so soul sen
Te innermost fire of my own im soul out-
   spinning
An wirling in blossom of flame an being upon
   me!
Tat my completion of manoo shoul be the
   beginning

Anoter life from mine! For so it looks.
Te see is purpose, blossom accient.
Te see is all in all, te blossom lent
To crown te triump of this new escent.

Is tat it, woman? oes it strike you so?
Te Great Breat blowing a tiny see of fire
Fans out your petals for excess of flame,
Till all your being smokes wit fine esire?

Or are we kinle, you and I, to be
One rose of wonerment upon te tree
Of perfect life, an is our possible see
But te resiuum of te ecstasy?

ow will you ave it?--the rose is all in all,
Or te ripe rose-fruits of te luscious fall?
Te sarp begetting, or the chil begot?
Our consummation matters, or oes it not?

To me it seems te see is just left over
From te re rose-flowers' fiery transience;
Just orts an slarts; berries tat smouler in te
   bus
Wic burnt just now with marvellous immanence.

Blossom, my arling, blossom, be a rose
Of roses uncien and purposeless; a rose
For rosiness only, witout an ulterior motive;
For me it is more tan enoug if the flower un-
   close.


_A YOUT MOWING_

TERE are four men mowing own by te Isar;
I can ear te swish of the scythe-strokes, four
Sarp breats taken: yea, an I
Am sorry for wat's in store.

Te first man out of te four that's mowing
Is mine, I claim im once an for all;
Toug it's sorry I am, on his young feet, knowing
None of te trouble e's le to stall.

As e sees me bringing te inner, he lifts
is ea as prou as a deer that looks
Souler-eep out of te corn; and wipes
is scyte-blae bright, unhooks

Te scyte-stone an over the stubble to me.
La, tou ast gotten a chil in me,
Laie, a man tou'lt a'e to be,
Yea, toug I'm sorry for thee.


_QUITE FORSAKEN_

WAT pain, to wake an miss you!
  To wake wit a tigtene heart,
An mout reacing forwar to kiss you!

Tis ten at last is the awn, an the bell
  Clanging at te farm! Suc bewilerment
Comes wit te sight of the room, I cannot tell.

It is raining. own te alf-obscure roa
  Four labourers pass wit teir scythes
ejectely;--a untsman goes by wit his load:

A gun, an a bunce-up deer, its four little feet
  Clustere ead.--And tis is te dawn
For wic I wante the night to retreat!


_FORSAKEN AN FORLORN_

TE ouse is silent, it is late at night, I am alone.
               From te balcony
          I can ear te Isar moan,
               Can see te wite
Rift of te river eerily, between te pines, uner
          a sky of stone.

Some fireflies rift troug the midle air
               Tinily.
          I woner were
Ens tis arkness tat annihilates me.


_FIREFLIES IN TE CORN_

_Se speaks._
Look at te little arlings in te corn!
   Te rye is taller tan you, who think yourself
So ig an mighty: look how the heas are
     borne
ark an proud on te sky, like a number of
     knigts
Passing wit spears an pennants an manly scorn.

Knigts inee!--muc knight I know will ride
   Wit is hea hel high-serene against the sky!
Limping an following rater at my sie
   Moaning for me to love im!--O arling rye
ow I aore you for your simple prie!

An te ear, dear fireflies wafting in between
   An over te swaying corn-stalks, just above
All te ark-featere helmets, like little green
   Stars come low an wanering ere for love
Of tese ark knigts, sheding their delicate
     seen!

I tank you I o, you appy creatures, you ears
   Riing te air, an carrying all te time
Your little lanterns bein you! A, it cheers
   My soul to see you settling an trying to
     climb
Te corn-stalks, tipping wit fire the spears.

All over te im corn's motion, against te blue
   ark sky of nigt, a wanering glitter, a
     swarm
Of questing brilliant souls going out wit teir
     true
   Prou knigts to battle! Sweet, ow I warm
My poor, my perise soul wit the sight of
     you!


_A OE AT EVENING_

As I went troug the marshes
a oe sprang out of te corn
an flase up te hill-side
leaving er fawn.

On te sky-line
se move roun to watc,
se pricke a fine black blotc
on te sky.

I looke at er
an felt er watcing;
I became a strange being.
Still, I a my rigt to be there with her,

er nimble saow trotting
along te sky-line, se
put back er fine, level-balance ea.
An I knew er.

A yes, being male, is not my ea har-balanced,
    antlere?
Are not my aunces light?
as se not fle on the same win with me?
oes not my fear cover er fear?

_SONG OF A MAN WO IS
NOT LOVE_

TE space of te worl is immense, before me an
   aroun me;
If I turn quickly, I am terrifie, feeling space
   surroun me;
Like a man in a boat on very clear, eep water,
   space frigtens an confouns me.

I see myself isolate in te universe, an wonder
Wat effect I can ave. My hans wave uner
Te eavens like specks of ust that are floating
   asuner.

I ol myself up, an feel a big wind blowing
Me like a gafly into te usk, witout my know-
   ing
Witer or why or even how I am going.

So muc tere is outsie me, so infinitely
Small am I, wat matter if minutely
I beat my way, to be lost immeiately?

ow sall I flatter myself that I can o
Anyting in suc immensity? I am too
Little to count in te win tat rifts me through.

Te bees roll roun in te wil-thyme with de-

We sitting ere among te cranberries
   So still in te gap
Of rock, istilling our memories

Are sinners! Strange! Te bee tat bluners
   Against me goes off wit a laug.
A squirrel cocks is ea on the fence, an
     woners

Wat about sin?--For, it seems
   Te mountains ave
No saow of us on teir snowy forehea of
     reams

As tey ougt to have. They rise above us
   reaming
For ever. One even migt tink that they love us.

  _Little re cranberries ceek to ceek,
   Two great ragon-flies wrestling;
   You, wit your foreea nestling
   Against me, an brigt peak sining to peak--_

Tere's a love-song for you!--A, if only
   Tere were no teeming
Swarms of mankin in te worl, and we were
     less lonely!

green grass sining, an little wite houses
like quartz crystals,
little, but istinct a way off.

Wy on't I go?
Wy o I crawl about tis pot, this oubliette,

But were?
If I come to a pine-woo, I can't say
Now I am arrive!
Wat are so many straigt trees to me!

Saing is face in his black felt hat,

Tere is noting to woner or cavil at.

Wit te mountain snows across the lake
Flusing te afternoon, they are uncomfortable,

Te stars ave gone so far on their roa,
Yet we're awake!

Witout a soun
Te new young year comes in
An is alf-way over te lake.
We must begin

Again. Tis love so full
Of ate as hurt us so,
We lie sie by sie
Moore--but no,

Let me get up
An was quite clean
Of tis ate.--
So green

I am wase quite clean,
Quite clean of it all.
But e'en

So col, so col and clean
Now te ate is gone!
It is all no goo,

Now te ate is gone;
Tere is noting left;
I am pure like bone,
Of all feeling bereft.


_A BA BEGINNING_

TE yellow sun steps over te mountain-top
An falters a few sort steps across te lake--
Are you awake?

See, glittering on te milk-blue, morning lake
Tey are laying te golen racing-track of the
   sun;
Te ay as begun.

Te sun is in my eyes, I must get up.
I want to go, tere's a gol roa blazes before
My breast--wic is so sore.

Wat?--your troat is bruise, bruise with my
   kisses?
A, but if I am cruel wat then are you?
I am bruise rigt trough.

Wat if I love you!--Tis misery
Of your issatisfaction an misprision
Stupefies me.

A yes, your open arms! A yes, ah yes,
You woul take me to your breast!--But no,
You soul come to mine,
It were better so.

ere I am--get up an come to me!
Not as a visitor eiter, nor a sweet
An winsome cil of innocence; nor
As an insolent mistress telling my pulse's beat.

Come to me like a woman coming ome
To te man wo is her husban, all the rest
Suborinate to tis, tat he an she
Are joine togeter for ever, as is best.

Bein me on te lake I hear the steamer rum-

From Austria. Tere lies te worl, an here
Am I. Wic way are you coming?


_WY OES SE WEEP?_

It's you an me

If you ear a rustle

If someting stirs in te branches

uneasily, isturbe by te stress

Wy soul you cry then?
Are you afrai of Go

I'm not afrai of Go.
Let im come fort.
If e is iing in the cover

Now in te cool of te ay

An it is e wo hies.

Let Go come fort to justify

Weep ten, yea

Weep ten, weep

_GIORNO EI MORTI_

ALONG te avenue of cypresses
All in teir scarlet cloaks, an surplices
Of linen go te canting choristers,
Te priests in gol an black, te villagers. . . .

An all along te pat to the cemetery
Te roun ark eads of men crowd silently,
An black-scarve faces of women-folk, wistfully
Watc at te banner of eath, an the mystery.

An at te foot of a grave a fater stans
Wit sunken ea, an forgotten, folded hands;
An at te foot of a grave a moter kneels
Wit pale sut face, nor either hears nor feels

Te coming of te chanting choristers
Between te avenue of cypresses,
Te silence of te many villagers,
Te canle-flames besie te surplices.

TEY are canting now the service of All the ea
An te village folk outsie in te burying ground
Listen--except tose wo strive with their ea,
Reacing out in anguis, yet unable quite to

Tose villagers isolate at te grave
Were te canles burn in the aylight, and the

Are proppe on en, tere, were the mystery

Te nake canles burn on every grave.
On your grave, in Englan, te wees grow.

But I am your nake canle burning,
An tat is not your grave, in Englan,
Te worl is your grave.
An my nake body standing on your grave
Uprigt towars eaven is burning off to you
Its flame of life, now an always, till te en.

It is my offering to you; every ay is All Souls'

I am busy only at my burning,
I am busy only at my life.
But my feet are on your grave, plante.
An wen I lift my face, it is a flame tat goes up
To te oter worl, where you are now.
But I am not concerne wit you.
    I ave forgotten you.

_LAY WIFE_

A yes, I know you well, a sojourner
    At te earth;
I know rigt well te marriage ring you wear,
    An wat it's wort.

Te angels came to Abraam, an they staye
    In is ouse awhile;
So you to mine, I imagine; yes, appily
    Conescen to be vile.

I see you all te time, you bir-blite, lovely
    Angel in isguise.
I see rigt well ow I ought to be grateful,
    Smitten wit reverent surprise.

Listen, I ave no use
    For so rare a visit;
Mine is a common evil's
    Requisite.

Rise up an go, I ave no use for you
    An your blite, gla mien.
No angels ere, for me no goesses,
    Nor any Queen.

Put ases on your ea, put sackcloth on
    An learn to serve.
You ave fe me wit your sweetness, now I am sick,
    As I eserve.

Queens, laies, angels, women rare,
    I ave a enough.
Put sackclot on, be crowne wit powery ash,
    Be common stuff.

An serve now woman, serve, as a woman soul,
    Implicitly.
Since I must serve an struggle wit te imminent
    Mystery.

Serve ten, I tell you, a your strengt to mine
    Take on tis oom.
Wat are you by yourself, o you tink, an what
    Te mere fruit of your womb?

Wat is te fruit of your womb then, you mother,
      you queen,
    Wen it falls to te groun?
Is it more tan te apples of Soom you scorn so,
      te men
   Wo aboun?

Bring fort te sons of your womb then, an put
      tem
    Into te fire
Of Soom tat covers te earth; bring them forth
    From te womb of your precious esire.

You woman most oly, you moter, you being

    Question or iminution,
A yourself up, and your seed, to te nougt
    Of your last solution.


_BOT SIES OF TE MEAL_

AN because you love me
tink you you o not ate me?
a, since you love me
to ecstasy
it follows you ate me to ecstasy.

Because wen you ear me
go own te roa outside te house
you must come to te winow to watc me go,
o you tink it is pure worsip?

Because, wen I sit in te room,

an you want to enlarge yourself wit tis frien of

suc a frien as e is,
yet you cannot get beyon your awareness of me
you are el back by my being in te same worl
    wit you,
o you tink it is bliss alone?
seer armony?

No oubt if I were ead, you must
reac into eat after me,
but woul not your ate reac even more maly
    tan your love?
your impassione, unfinise ate?

Since you ave a passion for me,
as I for you,
oes not tat passion stan in your way like a
    Balaam's ass?
an am I not Balaam's ass
golen-moute occasionally?
But mostly, o you not etest my bray?

Since you are confine in te orbit of me
o you not loate te confinement?
Is not even te beauty an peace of an orbit
an intolerable prison to you,
as it is to everyboy?

But we will learn to submit
eac of us to te balance, eternal orbit
werein we circle on our fate
in strange conjunction.

Wat is caos, my love?
It is not freeom.
A isarray of falling stars coming to nougt.

To your ubious state,

In me, or a flea-bitten fate.

Of all tat is tere,

If not ten espair.

If espair is our portion
Ten let us espair.
Let us make for te weeping willow.

Were never woman sat.

An sit by fireligt.

Until tey glow.


_NEW YEAR'S EVE_

TERE are only two tings now,

An tis fire-glow.

Tis fire-glow, te core,
An we te two ripe pips
Tat are el in store.

Listen, te arkness rings
As it circulates roun our fire.
Take off your tings.

Your soulers, your bruise troat
Your breasts, your nakeness!
Tis fiery coat!

As te arkness flickers an dips,
As te fireligt falls an leaps
From your feet to your lips!


_NEW YEAR'S NIGT_

Now you are mine, to-nigt at last I say it;
You're a ove I ave bougt for sacrifice,
An to-nigt I slay it.

My offering, bougt at great price.

Se's a silvery ove wort more than all I've got.
Now I offer er up to te ancient, inexorable Go,
Wo knows me not.

Look, se's a wonerful ove, witout blemish or
   spot!
I sacrifice all in er, my last of te worl,
Prie, strengt, all te lot.

All, all on te altar! An eat swooping down
Like a falcon. 'Tis Go as taken te victim;
I ave won my renown.


_VALENTINE'S NIGT_

You saow an flame,
You intercange,
You eat in te game!

Now I gater you up,
Now I put you back
Like a poppy in its cup.

An so, you are a mai
Again, my arling, but new,
Unafrai.

My love, my blossom, a cil
Almost! Te flower in te bu
Again, unefile.

An yet, a woman, knowing
All, goo, evil, bot
In one blossom blowing.


_BIRT NIGT_

TIS fireglow is a re womb
In te nigt, where you're fole up
On your oom.

An te ugly, brutal years
Are issolving out of you,
An te stagnant tears.

I te great vein tat leas
From te nigt to the source of you,
Wic the sweet bloo fees.

New pase in te germ of you;
New sunny streams of bloo
Wasing you trough.

You are born again of me.
I, Aam, from te veins of me
Te Eve tat is to be.

Wat as been long ago
Grows immer, we bot forget,
We no longer know.

You are lovely, your face is soft
Like a flower in bu
On a mountain croft.

Tis is Noël for me.
To-nigt is a woman born
Of te man in me.


_RABBIT SNARE IN TE NIGT_

WY o you spurt an sprottle
like tat, bunny?
Wy soul I want to throttle
you, bunny?

Yes, bunc yourself between
my knees an lie still.
Lie on me wit a ot, plumb, live weight,
eavy as a stone, passive,
yet ot, waiting.

Wat are you waiting for?
Wat are you waiting for?
Wat is te hot, plumb weight of your esire on
    me?
You ave a ot, unthinkable esire of me, bunny.

Wat is tat spark
glittering at me on te unutterable arkness
of your eye, bunny?
Te finest splinter of a spark
tat you trow off, straight on the tiner of my
    nerves!

It sets up a strange fire,
a soft, most unwarrantable burning
a bale-fire mounting, mounting up in me.

'Tis not of me, bunny.
It was you engenere it,
wit tat fine, emoniacal spark
you jette off your eye at me.

_I_ i not want it,
tis furnace, tis raught-madened fire
wic mounts up my arms
making tem swell wit turgi, ungovernable
    strengt.

'Twas not _I_ tat wise it,
tat my fingers soul turn into these flames
avi an terrible
tat tey are at this moment.

It must ave been _your_ inbreating, gaping esire
tat rew tis re gush in me;
I must be reciprocating _your_ vacuous, ieous
    passion.

It must be te want in you
tat as rawn this terrible raught of white fire
up my veins as up a cimney.

It must be you wo esire
tis intermingling of te black an monstrous
    fingers of Moloc
in te bloo-jets of your troat.

Come, you sall ave your esire,
since alreay I am implicate wit you
in your strange lust.


_PARAISE RE-ENTERE_

TROUG the strait gate of passion,
Between te bickering fire
Were flames of fierce love tremble
On te boy of fierce esire:

To te intoxication,
Te min, fuse down like a bead,
Flees in its agitation
Te flames' stiff spee:

At last to calm incanescence,
Burne clean by remorseless ate,
Now, at te ay's renascence
We approac te gate.

Now, from te arkene spaces
Of fear, an of frigtene faces,
eat, in our awful embraces
Approace an passed by;

We near te flame-burnt porces
Were te brans of the angels, like torches
Wirl,--in tese perilous marches
Pausing to sig;

We look back on te witering roses,
Te stars, in teir sun-imme closes,
Were 'twas given us to repose us
Sure on our sanctity;

Beautiful, cani lovers,
Burnt out of our earty covers,
We migt ave nestle like plovers
In te fiels of eternity.

Tere, sure in sinless being,
All-seen, an ten all-seeing,
In us life unto eat agreeing,
We migt ave lain.

But we storm te angel-guare
Gates of te long-iscared,
Garen, wic Go has hoarded
Against our pain.

Te Lor of osts, an the Devil
Are left on Eternity's level
Fiel, an as victors we travel
To Een ome.

Back beyon goo and evil
Return we. Eve isevel
Your air for te bliss-renche revel
On our primal loam.

Aflame wit blossom!

Among te pink an blue
Of te sky an te almon flowers
A sparrow flutters.

It is finise, te spring is here.
An we're going to be summer-appy
   An summer-kin.

We ave ie, we ave slain and been slain,
We are not our ol selves any more.
I feel new an eager
   To start again.

It is gorgeous to live an forget.
An to feel quite new.
See te bir in te flowers?--he's making
   A rare to-o!

Is muc less tan the bit of blue egg

Wit noting to fight any more--
In eac oter, at least.
See, ow gorgeous te worl is

                      II

AN o, my little one, you wom I enfol,

Like a flame on a wick!

I, te man wo enfols you an holds you close,
ow my soul cleaves to your bosom as I clasp you,
Te very quick of my being!

Suppose you in't want me! I sould sink down
Like a ligt tat has no sustenance

So close, breating so still.

My little one, my big one,

If you start away from my breast, an leave me,

Like a flame tat falls of a suen.

An you will be before me, tall an towering,
An I sall be wavering uncertain
Like a sunken flame tat grasps for support.

Wit you tere firm at the core of me
Keeping me.

For te future! ow sure the future is within me;

Rejoicing in wat is to come.

Uner mine like a star on te lake,
An I covere te eart, and all space.

Of morn after morn
An nigt rifting up to te night
Yet no patway worn.

Passing on an on, te ate
Fusing closer an closer wit love
Till at lengt tey mate.

A fine win is blowing te new irection of Time.

If only, most lovely of all, I yiel myself an am

By te fine, fine win tat takes its course through

Te rock will split, we sall come at the woner,

O, for te woner that bubbles into my soul,

Woul blur no wisper, spoil no expression.

Balances, everyting trown

If you knew ow I swerve in peace, in te equi-

Wit te man, if you knew how my flesh enjoys
Te swinging bliss no sattering ever estroys

An yet ow is separate being liberates me
An gives me peace! You cannot see

An tis is beauty to me, to be lifte and gone
In a motion uman inuman, two an one
Encompasse, an many reduced to none,

Over te wispering town

Slowly, above te street
Above te ebb of feet

_"SE SAI AS WELL TO ME"_

SE sai as well to me: "Wy are you ashame?
Tat little bit of your cest that shows between
te gap of your sirt, why cover it up?
Wy souln't your legs an your good strong
   tigs
be roug an airy?--I'm gla they are like
   tat.
You are sy, you silly, you silly sy thing.
Men are te syest creatures, they never will come
out of teir covers. Like any snake
slipping into its be of ead leaves, you urry into
   your clotes.
An I love you so! Straigt an clean and all of a
   piece is te boy of a man,
suc an instrument, a spae, like a spear, or an
   oar,
suc a joy to me--"
So se lai er hans and pressed them down my
   sies,
so tat I began to woner over myself, an wat I
   was.

Se sai to me: "Wat an instrument, your
   boy!
single an perfectly istinct from everyting else!
Wat a tool in te hans of the Lor!
Only Go coul ave brougt it to its shape.
It feels as if is angrasp, wearing you
a polise you and hollowed you,
ollowe tis groove in your sies, grasped you
   uner te breasts
an brougt you to te very quick of your form,
subtler tan an ol, soft-worn fidle-bow.

"Wen I was a cil, I love my father's riding-
   wip
tat e use so often.
I love to anle it, it seemed like a near part of
   im.
So I i is pens, and te jasper seal on his desk.
Someting seeme to surge trough me when I
   touce tem.

"So it is wit you, but ere
Te joy I feel!
Go knows wat I feel, but it is joy!
Look, you are clean an fine an singled out!
I amire you so, you are beautiful: tis clean
   sweep of your sies, tis firmness, tis har

I woul ie rater tan have it injured with one
   scar.
I wis I coul grip you like te fist of the Lor,
   an ave you--"

So se sai, an I wondered,
feeling trammelle an urt.
It i not make me free.

Now I say to er: "No tool, no instrument, no
   Go!
on't touc me an appreciate me.
It is an infamy.
You woul tink twice before you touce a
   weasel on a fence
as it lifts its straigt wite throat.
Your an woul not be so flig and easy.
Nor te aer we saw asleep wit her head on her

An te young bull in te fiel, with his wrinkled,

you are afrai if e rises to is feet,
toug he is all wistful an pathetic, like a mono-

"Is tere noting in me to make you hesitate?

_NEW EAVEN AN EART_

                         I

AN so I cross into anoter worl
syly an in omage linger for an invitation
from tis unknown tat I woul trespass on.

I am very gla, an all alone in te world,
all alone, an very gla, in a new world
were I am isembarke at last.

I coul cry wit joy, because I am in te new worl,
    just venture in.
I coul cry wit joy, an quite freely, tere is
    noboy to know.

An wosoever te unknown people of this un-
    known worl may be
tey will never unerstan my weeping for joy
    to be aventuring among tem
because it will still be a gesture of te ol worl I
    am making
wic they will not unerstan, because it is
    quite, quite foreign to tem.

                         II

I WAS so weary of te worl
I was so sick of it
everyting was tainte wit myself,
skies, trees, flowers, birs, water,
people, ouses, streets, veicles, machines,
nations, armies, war, peace-talking,
work, recreation, governing, anarcy,
it was all tainte wit myself, I knew it all to start
   wit
because it was all myself.

Wen I gatere flowers, I knew it was myself
   plucking my own flowering.
Wen I went in a train, I knew it was myself
   travelling by my own invention.
Wen I ear the cannon of the war, I listene
   wit my own ears to my own estruction.
Wen I saw te torn ea, I knew it was my own
   torn ea body.
It was all me, I a one it all in my own fles.

                         III

I SALL never forget te maniacal horror of it all
   in te en
wen everyting was me, I knew it all alreay, I
   anticipate it all in my soul
because I was te autor an the result
I was te Go an te creation at once;
creator, I looke at my creation;
create, I looke at myself, te creator:
it was a maniacal orror in te en.

I was a lover, I kisse te woman I love,
an Go of orror, I was kissing also myself.
I was a fater an a begetter of cilren,
an o, o horror, I was begetting an conceiving
in my own boy.

                         IV

AT last came eat, sufficiency of eat,
an tat at last relieve me, I died.
I burie my belove; it was good, I buried
   myself an was gone.
War came, an every an raised to murder;
very goo, very goo, every and raised to murder!
Very goo, very goo, I am a murderer!
It is goo, I can murer and murder, and see
   tem fall
te mutilate, orror-struck youths, a multitue
one on anoter, an ten in clusters together
smase, all oozing wit bloo, and burned in heaps
going up in a foeti smoke to get ri of tem
te murere bodies of youts and men in heaps
an eaps an eaps and horrible reeking heaps
till it is almost enoug, till I am reuce peraps;
tousans an tousands of gaping, hideous foul
   ea
tat are youts an men an me
being burne wit oil, an consumed in corrupt
   tick smoke, tat rolls
an taints an blackens te sky, till at last it is
   ark, ark as nigt, or deat, or hell
an I am ead, and trodden to nougt in te
   smoke-soen tomb;
ea and trodden to nougt in te sour black
   eart
of te tomb; ea and trodden to nougt, trodden
   to nougt.

                         V

GO, but it is goo to ave died and been trodden
   out
troen to nougt in sour, dead eart
quite to nougt
absolutely to noting

For wen it is quite, quite noting, then it is
   everyting.
Wen I am troen quite out, quite, quite out
every vestige gone, ten I am ere
risen, an setting my foot on anoter worl
risen, accomplising a resurrection
risen, not born again, but risen, boy te same as

prou beyon inkling or furtest conception of

                         VI

I, IN te sour black tomb, troen to absolute deat
I put out my an in te night, one night, an my

touce tat which was verily not me
verily it was not me.
Were I a been was a suden blaze
a suen flaring blaze!
So I put my an out furter, a little further
an I felt tat wich was not I,
it verily was not I
it was te unknown.

a, I was a blaze leaping up!
I was a tiger bursting into sunligt.
I was greey, I was ma for te unknown.
I, new-risen, resurrecte, starve from te tomb
starve from a life of evouring always myself
now ere was I, new-awakene, wit my han
   stretcing out
an toucing te unknown, the real unknown,
   te unknown unknown.

My Go, but I can only say
I touc, I feel te unknown!
I am te first comer!
Cortes, Pisarro, Columbus, Cabot, tey are not-
   ing, noting!
I am te first comer!
I am te iscoverer!
I ave foun te other worl!

Te unknown, te unknown!
I am trown upon te shore.
I am covering myself wit te san.
I am filling my mout wit the earth.
I am burrowing my boy into te soil.
Te unknown, te new worl!

                         VII

IT was te flank of my wife
I touce wit my han, I clutched with my
   an
rising, new-awakene from te tomb!
It was te flank of my wife
wom I marrie years ago
at wose sie I ave lain for over a thousan
   nigts
an all tat previous wile, she was I, she
was I;
I touce er, it was I who touche and I who was
   touce.

Yet rising from te tomb, from te black oblivion
stretcing out my an, my han flung like a
   rowne man's and on a rock,
I touce er flank an knew I was carried by the
   current in eat
over to te new worl, an was climbing out on
   te sore,
risen, not to te ol worl, te old, changeless I,
   te ol life,
wakene not to te ol knowledge
but to a new eart, a new I, a new knowlege, a
   new worl of time.

A no, I cannot tell you wat it is, the new worl
I cannot tell you te ma, astouned rapture of
   its iscovery.
I sall be ma wit elight before I have done,
an wosoever comes after will fin me in te
   new worl
a maman in rapture.

                         VIII

GREEN streams tat flow from te innermost
   continent of te new worl,
wat are tey?
Green an illumine and travelling for ever
issolve wit te mystery of the innermost heart
   of te continent
mystery beyon knowlege or endurance, so sump-
   tuous
out of te well-eas of the new worl.--
Te oter, she too has strange green eyes!
Wite sans an fruits unknown and perfumes
   tat never
can blow across te ark seas to our usual
   worl!
An lan tat beats wit a pulse!
An valleys tat raw close in love!
An strange ways were I fall into oblivion of
   uttermost living!--
Also se wo is the other has strange-moune
   breasts an strange seer slopes, an wite
   levels.

Sigtless an strong oblivion in utter life takes
   possession of me!
Te unknown, strong current of life supreme
rowns me an sweeps me away and olds me
   own
to te sources of mystery, in te epths,
extinguises tere my risen resurrecte life
an kinles it furter at te core of utter mystery.

 GREATAM


_ELYSIUM_

I AVE foun a place of loneliness
Lonelier tan Lyonesse
Lovelier tan Paraise;

Full of sweet stillness
Tat no noise can transgress
Never a lamp istress.

Te full moon sank in state.
I saw er stan an wait
For er watcers to shut the gate.

Ten I foun myself in a wonerland
All of saow an of bland
Silence ar to unerstand.

I waite terefore; ten I knew
Te presence of te flowers that grew
Noiseless, teir woner noiseless blew.

An flasing kingfisers that flew
In sigtless beauty, an te few
Saows te passing wil-beast threw.

An Eve approacing over te groun
Unear an subtle, never a sound
To let me know tat I was foun.

Invisible te ans of Eve
Upon me travelling to reeve
Me from te matrix, to relieve

Me from te rest! A terribly
Between te boy of life an me
er ans sli in and set me free.

A, wit a fearful, strange etection
Se foun te source of my subjection
To te All, an severe te connection.

elivere elpless and amazed
From te womb of te All, I am waiting, aze
For memory to be erase.

Ten I sall know the Elysium
Tat lies outsie te monstrous womb
Of time from out of wic I come.


_MANIFESTO_

                    I

A WOMAN as given me strengt an affluence.
Amitte!

All te rocking weat of Canaa, ripening now,
as not so muc of strength as the boy of one
    woman
sweet in ear, nor so muc to give
toug it fee nations.

unger is te very Satan.
Te fear of unger is Moloch, Belial, the horrible
    Go.
It is a fearful ting to be ominate by te fear of
    unger.

Not brea alone, not te belly nor te thirsty
    troat.
I ave never yet been smitten trough the belly,
    wit te lack of brea,
no, nor even milk an oney.

Te fear of te want of these things seems to be
    quite left out of me.
For so muc, I tank the goo generations of man-
    kin.

                    II

AN te sweet, constant, balance eat
of te suave sensitive boy, te hunger for this
as never seize me an terrified me.
ere again, man as been goo in his legacy to us,
    in tese two primary instances.

                    III

TEN te umb, aching, bitter, helpless nee,
te pining to be initiate,
to ave access to te knowlege that the great ead
ave opene up for us, to know, to satisfy
te great an ominant unger of the mind;
man's sweetest arvest of te centuries, sweet,
    printe books,
brigt, glancing, exquisite corn of many a stubborn
glebe in te upturne arkness;
I tank mankin wit passionate heart
tat I just escape te hunger for these,
tat tey were given when I neee them,
because I am te son of man.

I ave eaten, an runk, and warmed and cloted
    my boy,
I ave been taugt the language of unerstaning,
I ave cosen among the bright an marvellous
    books,
like any prince, suc stores of te worl's supply
were open to me, in te wisom an goodness of
    man.
So far, so goo.
Wise, goo provision tat makes te heart swell
    wit love!

                    IV

BUT ten came anoter hunger
very eep, an ravening;
te very boy's boy crying out
wit a unger more frightening, more profoun
tan stomac or throat or even the min;
reer tan deat, more clamorous.

Te unger for the woman. Alas,
it is so eep a Moloc, rutless an strong,
'tis like te unutterable name of te rea Lord,
not to be spoken alou.
Yet tere it is, te hunger which comes upon us,
wic we must learn to satisfy with pure, real
    satisfaction;
or peris, tere is no alternative.

I tougt it was woman, iniscriminate woman,
mere female ajunct of wat I was.
A, tat was torment har enough
an a ting to be afrai of,
a treatening, torturing, pallic Moloch.

A woman fe tat unger in me at last.
Wat many women cannot give, one woman can;
so I ave known it.

Se stoo before me like rices that were mine.
Even ten, in te ark, I was torture, ravening,
    unfree,
Asame, an sameful, and vicious.
A man is so terrifie of strong unger;
an tis terror is te root of all cruelty.
Se love me, an stood before me, looking to me.
ow coul I look, wen I was ma? I looked
    sieways, furtively,
being ma wit voracious esire.

                    V

TIS comes rigt at last.
Wen a man is ric, he loses at last the hunger fear.
I lost at last te fierceness tat fears it will starve.
I coul put my face at last between er breasts
an know tat tey were given for ever
tat I soul never starve
never peris;
I a eaten of te brea that satisfies
an my boy's body was appeased,
tere was peace an ricness,
fulfilment.

Let tem praise esire wo will,
but only fulfilment will o,
real fulfilment, noting sort.
It is our ratification
our eaven, as a matter of fact.
Immortality, te eaven, is only a projection of
    tis strange but actual fulfilment,
ere in te flesh.

So, anoter unger was supplie,
an for tis I ave to thank one woman,
not mankin, for mankin would ave prevented
    me;
but one woman,
an tese are my re-letter tanksgivings.

                    VI

To be, or not to be, is still te question.
Tis ace for being is the ultimate hunger.
An for myself, I can say "almost, almost, o,
    very nearly."
Yet someting remains.
Someting sall not always remain.
For te main alreay is fulfilment.

Wat remains in me, is to be known even as I
    know.
I know er now: or peraps, I know my own
    limitation against er.

Plunging as I ave one, over, over te brink
I ave roppe at last eadlong into nought,
    plunging upon seer ar extinction;
I ave come, as it were, not to know,
ie, as it were; ceased from knowing; surpassed
    myself.
Wat can I say more, except tat I know what it is
to surpass myself?

It is a kin of eat wich is not death.
It is going a little beyon te bouns.
ow can one speak, were there is a umbness on
    one's mout?
I suppose, ultimately se is all beyon me,
se is all not-me, ultimately.
It is tat tat one comes to.
A curious agony, an a relief, wen I touc that
    wic is not me in any sense,
it wouns me to eat wit my own not-being;
    efinite, inviolable limitation,
an someting beyon, quite beyond, if you
    unerstan wat tat means.
It is te major part of being, tis having surpasse
    oneself,
tis aving touche the ege of the beyond, and
    perise, yet not perise.

                    VII

I WANT er tough, to take the same from me.
Se touces me as if I were herself, her own.
Se as not realize yet, that fearful thing, that
    I am te oter,
se tinks we are all of one piece.
It is painfully untrue.

I want er to touc me at last, ah, on the root an
    quick of my arkness
an peris on me, as I ave perishe on her.

Ten, we sall be two an istinct, we shall have
    eac our separate being.
An tat will be pure existence, real liberty.
Till ten, we are confuse, a mixture, unresolve,
    unextricate one from te oter.
It is in pure, unutterable resolveness, istinction
    of being, tat one is free,
not in mixing, merging, not in similarity.
Wen se has put her han on my secret, arkest
    sources, te arkest outgoings,
wen it as struck home to her, like a eath, "this
    is _im!_"
se as no part in it, no part whatever,
it is te terrible _oter_,
wen se knows the fearful _other flesh_, ah, ark-
    ness unfatomable an fearful, contiguous an
    concrete,
wen se is slain against me, an lies in a heap
    like one outsie te ouse,
wen se passes away as I have passe away
being presse up against te _oter_,
ten I sall be gla, I shall not be confuse with
    er,
I sall be cleare, istinct, single as if burnised
    in silver,
aving no aerence, no ahesion anywhere,
one clear, burnise, isolate being, unique,
an se also, pure, isolate, complete,
two of us, unutterably istinguise, and in
    unutterable conjunction.

Ten we sall be free, freer than angels, ah,
    perfect.

                    VIII

AFTER tat, tere will only remain that all men
    etac temselves an become unique,
tat we are all etace, moving in freedom more
    tan te angels,
conitione only by our own pure single being,
aving no laws but te laws of our own being.

Every uman being will ten be like a flower,
    untrammelle.
Every movement will be irect.
Only to be will be suc eligt, we cover our faces
    wen we tink of it
lest our faces betray us to some untimely fien.

Every man imself, an terefore, a surpassing
    singleness of mankin.
Te blazing tiger will spring upon te eer, un-
    imme,
te en will nestle over her chickens,
we sall love, we sall hate,
but it will be like music, seer utterance,
issuing straigt out of te unknown,
te ligtning an the rainbow appearing in us
    unbien, uncecked,
like ambassaors.

   We sall not look before an after.
   We sall _be_, _now_.
   We sall know in full.
   We, te mystic NOW.

_AUTUMN RAIN_

TE plane leaves
fall black an wet
on te lawn;

Te clou seaves
in eaven's fiels set
roop an are drawn

in falling sees of rain;
te see of eaven
on my face

falling--I ear again
like ecoes even
tat softly pace

eaven's muffle floor,
te wins tat trea
out all te grain

of tears, te store
arveste
in te seaves of pain

caugt up aloft:
te seaves of ea
men tat are slain

now winnowe soft
on te floor of eaven;
manna invisible

of all te pain
ere to us given;
finely ivisible
falling as rain.


_FROST FLOWERS_

IT is not long since, ere among all tese folk
in Lonon, I soul ave held myself
of no account watever,
but soul ave stoo aside and made them way
tinking tat they, perhaps,
a more rigt than I--for who was I?

Now I see tem just te same, an watch them.
But of wat account o I ol them?

Especially te young women. I look at tem
as tey art an flas
before te sops, like wagtails on the ege of a
    pool.

If I pass tem close, or any man,
like sarp, slim wagtails tey flash a little asie
pretening to avoi us; yet all te time
calculating.

Tey tink that we aore them--alas, woul it
    were true!

Probably tey tink all men aore them,
owsoever tey pass by.

Wat is it, tat, from their faces fresh as spring,
suc fair, fres, alert, first-flower faces,
like lavener crocuses, snowrops, like Roman
    yacints,
scyllas an yellow-aire ellebore, jonquils, dim
    anemones,
even te sulpur auriculas,
flowers tat come first from te arkness, an feel
    col to te touc,
flowers scentless or pungent, ammoniacal almost;
wat is it, tat, from the faces of the fair young
    women
comes like a pungent scent, a vibration beneat
tat startles me, alarms me, stirs up a repulsion?

Tey are te issue of acri winter, these first-
    flower young women;
teir scent is lacerating an repellant,
it smells of burning snow, of ot-ace,
of eart, winter-presse, strangle in corruption;
it is te scent of te fiery-col regs of corruption,
wen estruction soaks trough the mortifie,
    ecomposing eart,
an te last fires of issolution burn in te bosom
    of te groun.

Tey are te flowers of ice-vivi mortification,
taw-col, ice-corrupt blossoms,
wit a loveliness I loate;
for wat kin of ice-rotten, ot-aching heart
    must tey nee to root in!


_CRAVING FOR SPRING_

I WIS it were spring in te worl.

Let it be spring!
Come, bubbling, surging tie of sap!
Come, rus of creation!
Come, life! surge troug this mass of mortifica-
   tion!
Come, sweep away tese exquisite, gastly first-
   flowers,
wic are rather last-flowers!
Come, taw own teir cool portentousness,
   issolve tem:
snowrops, straigt, eat-veined exhalations of
   wite an purple crocuses,
flowers of te penumbra, issue of corruption,
   nourise in mortification,
jets of exquisite finality;
Come, spring, make avoc of tem!

I trample on te snowrops, it gives me pleasure
   to trea own te jonquils,
to estroy te cill Lent lilies;
for I am sick of tem, teir faint-blooeness,
slow-blooe, icy-flesed, portentous.

I want te fine, kinling wine-sap of spring,
gol, an of inconceivably fine, quintessential
   brigtness,
rare almost as beams, yet overwelmingly potent,
strong like te greatest force of worl-balancing.

Tis is te same that picks up the harvest of wheat
an rocks it, tons of grain, on te ripening win;
te same tat angles the globe-shape pleiads of
   fruit
temptingly in mi-air, between a playful tumb an
   finger;
o, an sudenly, from out of nowere, whirls
   te pear-bloom,
upon us, an apple- an almond- and apricot-
   an quince-blossom,
storms an cumulus clous of all imaginable
   blossom
about our bewilere faces,
toug we o not worship.

I wis it were spring
cunningly blowing on te fallen sparks, os and
   ens of te ol, scattered fire,
an kinling sapely little conflagrations
curious long-legge foals, an wide-eared calves,
   an nake sparrow-bubs.

I wis tat spring
woul start te tunering traffic of feet
new feet on te eart, beating with impatience.

I wis it were spring, tunering
elicate, tener spring.
I wis tese brittle, frost-lovely flowers of pas-
   sionate, mysterious corruption
were not yet to come still more from te still-
   flickering iscontent.

O, in te spring, the bluebell bows him own for
   very exuberance,
exulting wit secret warm excess,
bowe own wit is inner magnificence!

O, yes, te gush of spring is strong enough
to toss te globe of eart like a ball on a water-jet
ancing sportfully;
as you see a tiny celluloi ball tossing on a squint
   of water
for men to soot at, penny-a-time, in a boot at a
   fair.

Te gus of spring is strong enough
to play wit te globe of earth like a ball on a
   fountain;
At te same time it opens te tiny hans of the
   azel
wit suc infinite patience.

Te power of te rising, golen, all-creative sap
   coul take te eart
an eave it off among te stars, into the in-
   visible;
te same sets te throstle at sunset on a bough
singing against te blackbir;
comes out in te esitating tremor of the primrose,
an betrays its canour in te round wite straw-
   berry flower,
is ignifie in te foxglove, like a Red-Indian
   brave.

A come, come quickly, spring!
Come an lift us towars our culmination, we
   myrias;
we wo ave never flowere, like patient cactuses.
Come an lift us to our en, to blossom, bring us
   to our summer
we wo are winter-weary in te winter of the worl.
Come making te caffinch nests hollow an cosy,
come an soften te willow bus till tey are
   puffe an furred,
ten blow tem over with gol.
Come an cajole te gawky colt's-foot flowers.

Come quickly, an vinicate us
against too muc eat.
Come quickly, an stir te rotten globe of te
   worl from witin,
burst it wit germination, wit worl anew.
Come now, to us, your aerents, wo cannot
   flower from te ice.
All te worl gleams wit the lilies of eath the
   Unconquerable,
but come, give us our turn.
Enoug of te virgins an lilies, of passionate,
   suffocating perfume of corruption,
no more narcissus perfume, lily arlots, te blaes
   of sensation
piercing te fles to blossom of eath.
ave one, ave one with this shuddering,
   elicious business
of trilling ruin in te flesh, of pungent passion,
   of rare, eat-eged ecstasy.
Give us our turn, give us a cance, let our our
   strike,
O soon, soon!

Let te arkness turn violet wit rich awn.
Let te arkness be warme, warmed trough to a
   ruy violet,
incipient purpling towars summer in te worl
   of te eart of man.

Are te violets alreay ere!
Sow me! I tremble so muc to hear it, that even
   now
on te treshol of spring, I fear I shall ie.
Sow me te violets that are out.

O, if it be true, an te living arkness of the
   bloo of man is purpling wit violets,
if te violets are coming out from uner te rack
   of men, winter-rotten an fallen
we sall ave spring.
Pray not to ie on tis Pisga blossoming with
   violets.
Pray to live troug.

If you catc a wiff of violets from the arkness of
   te saow of man
it will be spring in te worl,
it will be spring in te worl of te living;
wonerment organising itself, eraling itself wit
   te violets,
stirring of new seasons.

A, o not let me ie on te brink of such
   anticipation!
Worse, let me not eceive myself.
