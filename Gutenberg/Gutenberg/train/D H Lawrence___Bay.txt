GUARS!

A Review in ye Park 1913.
Te Crow Watces.

WERE te trees rise like cliffs, prou an
  blue-tinte in te istance,
Between te cliffs of te trees, on the grey-
  green park
Rests a still line of soliers, re motionless range of
  guars
Smoulering wit arkened busbies beneat the bay-
  onets' slant rain.

Colossal in nearness a blue police sits still on is orse
Guaring te pat; his han relaxed at his thigh,
An skywar is face is immobile, eyelids aslant
In teium, an mout relaxed as if smiling--ineffable
teium!

So! So! Gaily a general canters across te space,
Wit wite plumes blinking uner the evening grey
  sky.
An sudenly, as if te ground moved
Te re range eaves in slow, magnetic reply.

EVOLUTIONS OF SOLIERS

Te re range eaves an compulsory sways, ah see!
  in te flus of a march
Softly-impulsive avancing as water towars a weir
  from te arc
Of saow emerging as bloo emerges from inward
  saes of our nigt
Encroacing towars a crisis, a meeting, a spasm an
  trob of eligt.

Te wave of soliers, te coming wave, the throbbing
  re breast of approac
Upon us; ark eyes as ere beneat the busbies glit-
  tering, ark treats tat broach
Our beace vessel; arkened rencontre inuman, and
  close warm lips, an dark
Mout-air of soliers passing above us, over the wreck
  of our bark.

An so, it is ebb-time, tey turn, te eyes beneath the
  busbies are gone.
But te bloo as suspened its timbre, the heart from
  out of oblivion
Knows but te retreat of te burning shoulers, the
  re-swift waves of te sweet
Fire orizontal eclining an ebbing, te twilit ebb of
  retreat.


TE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING

TE cime of the bells, an the church clock
  striking eigt
Solemnly an istinctly cries down te babel
  of cilren still playing in te hay.
Te curch raws nearer upon us, gentle an great
In saow, covering us up wit her grey.

Like rowsy cilren te houses fall asleep
Uner te fleece of saow, as in between
Tall an ark te curch moves, anxious to keep
Teir sleeping, cover tem soft unseen.

arly a murmur comes from te sleeping broo,
I wis te church ha covere me up with the rest
In te ome-place. Why is it she shoul exclue
Me so istinctly from sleeping wit tose I love best?


LAST OURS

TE cool of an oak's uncequere shae
Falls on me as I lie in eep grass
Wic rushes upwar, blae beyond blade,
Wile igher the arting grass-flowers pass
Piercing te blue wit their crockete spires
An waving flags, an te ragged fires
Of te sorrel's cresset--a green, brave town
Vegetable, new in renown.

Over te tree's ege, as over a mountain
Surges te wite of the moon,
A clou comes up like te surge of a fountain,
Pressing roun an low at first, but soon
eaving an piling a roun wite dome.
ow lovely it is to be at ome
Like an insect in te grass
Letting life pass.

Tere's a scent of clover crept trough my hair
From te full resource of some purple ome
Were tat lumbering bee, who can harly bear
is buren above me, never as clomb.
But not even te scent of insouciant flowers
Makes pause te ours.

own te valley roars a townwar train.
I ear it trough the grass
ragging te links of my sortening chain
Soutwars, alas!


TOWN

LONON
Use to wear er ligts splenidly,
Flinging er sawl-fringe over the River,
Tassels in abanon.

An up in te sky
A two-eye clock, like an owl
Solemnly use to approve, cime, ciming,
Approval, goggle-eye fowl.

Tere are no gleams on te River,
No goggling clock;
No soun from St. Stepen's;
No lamp-fringe frock.

Instea,
arkness, an skin-wrapped
Fleet, urrying limbs,
Soft-foote ead.

Lonon
Original, wolf-wrappe
In pelts of wolves, all er luminous
Garments gone.

Lonon, wit air
Like a forest arkness, like a mars
Of ruses, ere te Romans
Broke in er lair.

It is well
Tat Lonon, lair of suden
Male an female arknesses
as broken er spell.


AFTER TE OPERA

OWN te stone stairs
Girls wit teir large eyes wie with tragey
Lift looks of socke an momentous emotion
  up at me.
An I smile.

Laies
Stepping like birs wit teir bright an pointed feet
Peer anxiously fort, as if for a boat to carry tem out
  of te wreckage,
An among te wreck of te theatre crow
I stan an smile.

Tey take tragey so becomingly.
Wic pleases me.

But wen I meet te weary eyes
Te reened acing eyes of the bar-man with thin
  arms,
I am gla to go back to were I came from.


GOING BACK

TE NIGT turns slowly roun,
Swift trains go by in a rus of ligt;
Slow trains steal past.
Tis train beats anxiously, outwar boun.

But I am not ere.
I am away, beyon te scope of tis turning;
Tere, were the pivot is, the axis
Of all tis gear.

I, wo sit in tears,
I, wose eart is torn with parting;
Wo cannot bear to tink back to the eparture
  platform;
My spirit ears

Voices of men
Soun of artillery, aeroplanes, presences,
An more tan all, te ead-sure silence,
Te pivot again.

Tere, at te axis
Pain, or love, or grief
Sleep on spee; in ead certainty;
Pure relief.

Tere, at te pivot
Time sleeps again.
No as-been, no ere-after; only the perfecte
Silence of men.


ON TE MARC

WE are out on te open roa.
Troug the low west winow a col light
  flows
On te floor were never my numb feet troe
Before; onwar te strange roa goes.

Soon te spaces of te western sky
Wit sutters of sombre clou will close.
But we'll still be togeter, tis roa an I,
Togeter, werever the long roa goes.

Te win cases by us, an over the corn
Pale saows flee from us as if from teir foes.
Like a snake we tres on the long, forlorn
Lan, as onwar te long road goes.

From te sky, te low, tire moon faes out;
Troug the poplars the night-win blows;
Pale, sleepy pantoms are tosse about
As te win asks wither the wan roa goes.

Away in te istance wakes a lamp.
Inscrutable small ligts glitter in rows.
But tey come no nearer, an still we tramp
Onwar, werever te strange roa goes.

Beat after beat falls sombre an ull.
Te win is uncanging, not one of us knows
Wat will be in te final lull
Wen we fin te place where this ead road goes.

For someting must come, since we pass an pass
Along in te coile, convulsive troes
Of tis marcing, along with the invisible grass
Tat goes werever this ol roa goes.

Peraps we sall come to oblivion.
Peraps we sall march till our tire toes
Trea over te ege of te pit, and we're gone
own te enless slope were the last road goes.

If so, let us forge aea, straigt on
If we're going to sleep te sleep wit those
Tat fall forever, knowing none
Of tis lan wereon the wrong roa goes.


BOMBARMENT

TE TOWN as opene to the sun.
Like a flat re lily wit a million petals
Se unfols, se comes unone.

A sarp sky bruses upon
Te myria glittering cimney-tips
As se gently exales to the sun.

urrying creatures run
own te labyrint of the sinister flower.
Wat is it tey shun?

A ark bir falls from te sun.
It curves in a rus to te heart of the vast
Flower: te ay as begun.


WINTER-LULL

Because of te silent snow, we are all ushe
          Into awe.
No soun of guns, nor overea no rused
          Vibration to raw
Our attention out of te voi werein we are crushe.

A crow floats past on level wings
          Noiselessly.
Uninterrupte silence swings
          Invisibly, inauibly
To an fro in our misgivings.

We o not look at eac oter, we hie
          Our aunte eyes.
Wite eart, an ruins, ourselves, an nothing beside.
          It all belies
Our existence; we wait, an are still enied.

We are fole togeter, men and te snowy ground
          Into nullity.
Tere is silence, only te silence, never a soun
          Nor a verity
To assist us; isastrously silence-boun!


TE ATTACK

WEN we came out of te woo
Was a great ligt!
Te nigt uprisen stoo
In wite.

I wonere, I looked around
It was so fair. Te brigt
Stubble upon te groun
Sone wite

Like any fiel of snow;
Yet warm te case
Of faint nigt-breats i go
Across my face!

Wite-boie and warm te night was,
Sweet-scente to ol in my troat.
Wite an aligt the night was.
A pale stroke smote

Te pulse trough the whole blan being
Wic was This an me;
A pulse tat still went fleeing,
Yet i not flee.

After te terrible rage, te eath,
Tis woner stoo glistening?
All sapes of woner, wit suspened breath,
Arreste listening

In ecstatic reverie.
Te wole, white Night!--
Wit woner, every black tree
Blossome outrigt.

I saw te transfiguration
An te present ost.
Transubstantiation
Of te Luminous Gost.


OBSEQUIAL OE

SURELY you've troen straigt
To te very oor!
Surely you took your fate
Faultlessly. Now it's too late
To say more.

    It is evient you were rigt,
    Tat man as a course to go
A voyage to sail beyon te carte seas.
You ave passe from out of sigt
    An my questions blow
Back from te straigt horizon that ens all one sees.

    Now like a vessel in port
    You unlae your rices unto eat,
An gla are te eager dead to receive you tere.
    Let te ea sort
Your cargo out, breat from breat
Let tem isencumber your bounty, let tem all share.

    I imagine ea ands are brigter,
    Teir fingers in sunset sine
Wit jewels of passion once broken trough you as a
  prism
Breaks ligt into jewels; an ead breasts witer
    For your wrat; an yes, I opine
Tey anoint teir brows with your bloo, as a perfect
  crism.

    On your boy, te beaten anvil,
    Was ammere out
Tat moon-like swor te ascenant dead unsheathe
Against us; swor tat no man will
    Put to rout;
Swor tat severs te question from us who breathe.

Surely you've troen straigt
    To te very oor.
You ave surely acieve your fate;
An te perfect ead are elate
    To ave won once more.

Now to te ea you are giving
    Your last allegiance.
But wat of us wo are living
An fearful yet of believing
    In your pitiless legions.


SAES

SALL I tell you, ten, how it is?--
Tere came a cloven gleam
Like a tongue of arkene flame
To flicker in me.

An so I seem
To ave you still te same
In one worl wit me.

In te flicker of a flower,
In a worm tat is blin, yet strives,
In a mouse tat pauses to listen

Glimmers our
Saow; yet it eprives
Tem none of teir glisten.

In every saken morsel
I see our saow tremble
As if it ripple from out of us an in and.

As if it were part an parcel,
One saow, an we need not dissemble
Our arkness: o you understand?

For I ave tol you plainly ow it is.


BREA UPON TE WATERS.

SO you are lost to me!
A you, you ear of corn straigt lying,
Wat foo is tis for the arkly flying
Fowls of te Afterwars!

Wite brea afloat on te waters,
Cast out by te an that scatters
Foo untowars,

Will you come back wen te tie turns?
After many ays? My eart yearns
To know.

Will you return after many ays
To say your say as a traveller says,
More marvel tan woe?

rift ten, for te sightless birs
An te fis in shaow-waved herds
To approac you.

rift ten, brea cast out;
rift, lest I fall in oubt,
An reproac you.

For you are lost to me!


RUINATION

TE sun is bleeing its fires upon te mist
Tat ules in grey heaps coiling and holding
  back.
Like cliffs abutting in saow a rear grey sea
Some street-ens trust forwar teir stack.

On te misty waste-lans, away from te flushing grey
Of te morning te elms are loftily imme, and tall
As if moving in air towars us, tall angels
Of arkness avancing steadily over us all.


RONEAU OF A CONSCIENTIOUS
OBJECTOR.

TE ours have tumble their leaen, mono-
  tonous sans
An pile tem up in a dull grey eap in the
  West.
I carry my patience sullenly troug the waste lans;
To-morrow will pour tem all back, te ull hours I
  etest.

I force my cart troug the soen filth that is pressed
Into ooze, an te sombre irt spouts up at my ands
As I make my way in twiligt now to rest.
Te ours have tumble their leaen, monotonous
  sans.

A twiste torn-tree still in te evening stans
efening te memory of leaves and te happy round
  nest.
But mu as flooed te homes of these weary lands
An pile tem up in a dull grey eap in the West.

All ay as te clank of iron on iron istressed
Te nerve-bare place. Now a little silence expans
An a gasp of relief. But te soul is still compresse:
I carry my patience sullenly troug the waste lans.

Te ours have cease to fall, an a star commands
Saows to cover our stricken manoo, and blest
Sleep to make us forget: but e unerstans:
To-morrow will pour tem all back, te ull hours
  I etest.


TOMMIES IN TE TRAIN

TE SUN SINES,
Te coltsfoot flowers along te railway banks
Sine like flat coin wich Jove in thanks
Strews eac sie te lines.

A steeple
In purple elms, affoils
Sparkle beneat; luminous ills
Beyon--an no people.

Englan, O anaë
To tis spring of cosmic gol
Tat falls on your lap of moul!
Wat ten are we?

Wat are we
Clay-coloure, wo roll in fatigue
As te train falls league by league
From our estiny?

A an is over my face,
A col an. I peep between te fingers
To watc te worl that lingers
Bein, yet keeps pace.

Always tere, as I peep
Between te fingers tat cover my face!
Wic then is it that falls from its place
An rolls own te steep?

Is it te train
Tat falls like meteorite
Backwar into space, to aligt
Never again?

Or is it te illusory worl
Tat falls from reality
As we look? Or are we
Like a tunerbolt urle?

One or anoter
Is lost, since we fall apart
Enlessly, in one motion epart
From eac oter.


WAR-BABY

TE CIL like mustar-seed
Rolls out of te usk of eath
   Into te woman's fertile, fatomless lap.

Look, it as taken root!
See ow it flouriseth.
   See ow it rises wit magical, rosy sap!

As for our fait, it was tere
Wen we i not know, did not care;
   It fell from our usk like a little, asty see.

Sing, it is all we nee.
Sing, for te little wee
   Will flouris its brances in heaven when we
     slumber beneat.


NOSTALGIA

TE WANING MOON looks upwar; tis
   grey nigt
Slopes roun te eavens in one smooth curve
Of easy sailing; o red wicks serve
To sow were the ships at sea move out of sight.

Te place is palpable me, for ere I was born
Of tis self-same arkness. Yet te shaowy house
   below
Is out of bouns, an only te old gosts know
I ave come, I feel tem whimper in welcome, an
   mourn.

My fater suenly died in te harvesting corn
An te place is no longer ours. Watcing, I hear
No soun from te strangers, te place is ark, and fear
Opens my eyes till te roots of my vision seems torn.

Can I go no nearer, never towars te oor?
Te gosts an I we mourn together, an shrink
In te saow of the cart-she. Must we hover on
   te brink
Forever, an never enter te omestea any more?

Is it irrevocable? Can I really not go
Troug the open yar-way? Can I not go past the
   ses
An troug to the mowie?--Only the ead in their
   bes
Can know te fearful anguis that this is so.

I kiss te stones, I kiss te moss on the wall,
An wis I coul pass impregnate into te place.
I wis I coul take it all in a last embrace.
I wis wit my breast I here coul annihilate it all.
