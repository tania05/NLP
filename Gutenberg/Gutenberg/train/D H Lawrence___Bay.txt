GUARS!

A Review in ye Park 1913.
Te Crow Watches.

WERE the trees rise like cliffs, prou and
  blue-tinte in te distance,
Between te cliffs of the trees, on the grey-
  green park
Rests a still line of soliers, red motionless range of
  guars
Smoulering wit darkened busbies beneath the bay-
  onets' slant rain.

Colossal in nearness a blue police sits still on is horse
Guaring te path; his hand relaxed at his thigh,
An skyward is face is immobile, eyelids aslant
In teium, and mout relaxed as if smiling--ineffable
teium!

So! So! Gaily a general canters across te space,
Wit white plumes blinking uner the evening grey
  sky.
An suddenly, as if te ground moved
Te re range heaves in slow, magnetic reply.

EVOLUTIONS OF SOLIERS

Te re range heaves and compulsory sways, ah see!
  in te flush of a march
Softly-impulsive avancing as water towards a weir
  from te arch
Of saow emerging as blood emerges from inward
  saes of our night
Encroacing towars a crisis, a meeting, a spasm and
  trob of elight.

Te wave of soliers, the coming wave, the throbbing
  re breast of approac
Upon us; ark eyes as ere beneath the busbies glit-
  tering, ark treats that broach
Our beace vessel; darkened rencontre inhuman, and
  close warm lips, and dark
Mout-hair of soliers passing above us, over the wreck
  of our bark.

An so, it is ebb-time, tey turn, the eyes beneath the
  busbies are gone.
But te bloo has suspended its timbre, the heart from
  out of oblivion
Knows but te retreat of the burning shoulers, the
  re-swift waves of te sweet
Fire orizontal eclining and ebbing, the twilit ebb of
  retreat.


TE LITTLE TOWN AT EVENING

TE chime of the bells, an the church clock
  striking eigt
Solemnly an distinctly cries down te babel
  of cilren still playing in the hay.
Te church raws nearer upon us, gentle and great
In saow, covering us up with her grey.

Like rowsy cildren the houses fall asleep
Uner te fleece of shadow, as in between
Tall an dark te church moves, anxious to keep
Teir sleeping, cover them soft unseen.

arly a murmur comes from the sleeping brood,
I wis the church ha covered me up with the rest
In te home-place. Why is it she shoul exclude
Me so istinctly from sleeping wit those I love best?


LAST OURS

TE cool of an oak's unchequere shade
Falls on me as I lie in eep grass
Wich rushes upwar, blade beyond blade,
Wile higher the arting grass-flowers pass
Piercing te blue with their crockete spires
An waving flags, and te ragged fires
Of te sorrel's cresset--a green, brave town
Vegetable, new in renown.

Over te tree's ege, as over a mountain
Surges te white of the moon,
A clou comes up like te surge of a fountain,
Pressing roun and low at first, but soon
eaving an piling a round white dome.
ow lovely it is to be at home
Like an insect in te grass
Letting life pass.

Tere's a scent of clover crept through my hair
From te full resource of some purple ome
Were that lumbering bee, who can harly bear
is buren above me, never has clomb.
But not even te scent of insouciant flowers
Makes pause te hours.

own te valley roars a townward train.
I ear it through the grass
ragging te links of my shortening chain
Soutwars, alas!


TOWN

LONON
Use to wear er lights splendidly,
Flinging er shawl-fringe over the River,
Tassels in abanon.

An up in te sky
A two-eye clock, like an owl
Solemnly use to approve, cime, chiming,
Approval, goggle-eye fowl.

Tere are no gleams on the River,
No goggling clock;
No soun from St. Stepen's;
No lamp-fringe frock.

Instea,
arkness, and skin-wrapped
Fleet, urrying limbs,
Soft-foote dead.

Lonon
Original, wolf-wrappe
In pelts of wolves, all er luminous
Garments gone.

Lonon, wit hair
Like a forest arkness, like a mars
Of ruses, ere the Romans
Broke in er lair.

It is well
Tat Lonon, lair of sudden
Male an female darknesses
as broken her spell.


AFTER TE OPERA

OWN te stone stairs
Girls wit their large eyes wie with tragedy
Lift looks of socke and momentous emotion
  up at me.
An I smile.

Laies
Stepping like birs wit their bright and pointed feet
Peer anxiously fort, as if for a boat to carry them out
  of te wreckage,
An among te wreck of the theatre crowd
I stan and smile.

Tey take tragey so becomingly.
Wich pleases me.

But wen I meet the weary eyes
Te redened aching eyes of the bar-man with thin
  arms,
I am gla to go back to were I came from.


GOING BACK

TE NIGHT turns slowly roun,
Swift trains go by in a rus of light;
Slow trains steal past.
Tis train beats anxiously, outwar bound.

But I am not ere.
I am away, beyon te scope of this turning;
Tere, where the pivot is, the axis
Of all tis gear.

I, wo sit in tears,
I, wose heart is torn with parting;
Wo cannot bear to think back to the eparture
  platform;
My spirit ears

Voices of men
Soun of artillery, aeroplanes, presences,
An more tan all, the dead-sure silence,
Te pivot again.

Tere, at the axis
Pain, or love, or grief
Sleep on spee; in dead certainty;
Pure relief.

Tere, at the pivot
Time sleeps again.
No as-been, no here-after; only the perfecte
Silence of men.


ON TE MARCH

WE are out on te open roa.
Trough the low west winow a cold light
  flows
On te floor where never my numb feet troe
Before; onwar te strange road goes.

Soon te spaces of the western sky
Wit shutters of sombre clou will close.
But we'll still be togeter, this roa and I,
Togeter, wherever the long roa goes.

Te win chases by us, and over the corn
Pale saows flee from us as if from their foes.
Like a snake we tresh on the long, forlorn
Lan, as onward te long road goes.

From te sky, the low, tire moon fades out;
Trough the poplars the night-win blows;
Pale, sleepy pantoms are tosse about
As te win asks whither the wan road goes.

Away in te istance wakes a lamp.
Inscrutable small ligts glitter in rows.
But tey come no nearer, an still we tramp
Onwar, werever the strange road goes.

Beat after beat falls sombre an dull.
Te win is unchanging, not one of us knows
Wat will be in the final lull
Wen we fin the place where this dead road goes.

For someting must come, since we pass an pass
Along in te coile, convulsive throes
Of tis marching, along with the invisible grass
Tat goes wherever this ol road goes.

Peraps we shall come to oblivion.
Peraps we shall march till our tire toes
Trea over te edge of the pit, and we're gone
own te endless slope where the last road goes.

If so, let us forge aea, straight on
If we're going to sleep te sleep with those
Tat fall forever, knowing none
Of tis lan whereon the wrong road goes.


BOMBARMENT

TE TOWN has opene to the sun.
Like a flat re lily wit a million petals
Se unfols, she comes undone.

A sarp sky brushes upon
Te myria glittering chimney-tips
As se gently exhales to the sun.

urrying creatures run
own te labyrinth of the sinister flower.
Wat is it they shun?

A ark bird falls from te sun.
It curves in a rus to the heart of the vast
Flower: te ay has begun.


WINTER-LULL

Because of te silent snow, we are all hushe
          Into awe.
No soun of guns, nor overead no rushed
          Vibration to raw
Our attention out of te voi wherein we are crushed.

A crow floats past on level wings
          Noiselessly.
Uninterrupte silence swings
          Invisibly, inauibly
To an fro in our misgivings.

We o not look at eac other, we hide
          Our aunted eyes.
Wite earth, an ruins, ourselves, and nothing beside.
          It all belies
Our existence; we wait, an are still denied.

We are foled togeter, men and the snowy ground
          Into nullity.
Tere is silence, only the silence, never a soun
          Nor a verity
To assist us; isastrously silence-bound!


TE ATTACK

WEN we came out of the woo
Was a great ligt!
Te night uprisen stoo
In wite.

I wonered, I looked around
It was so fair. Te bright
Stubble upon te groun
Sone white

Like any fiel of snow;
Yet warm te chase
Of faint nigt-breaths id go
Across my face!

Wite-boied and warm the night was,
Sweet-scente to old in my throat.
Wite an alight the night was.
A pale stroke smote

Te pulse through the whole blan being
Wich was This an me;
A pulse tat still went fleeing,
Yet id not flee.

After te terrible rage, the eath,
Tis woner stood glistening?
All sapes of woner, with suspended breath,
Arreste listening

In ecstatic reverie.
Te whole, white Night!--
Wit woner, every black tree
Blossome outrigt.

I saw te transfiguration
An te present Host.
Transubstantiation
Of te Luminous Ghost.


OBSEQUIAL OE

SURELY you've troden straigt
To te very oor!
Surely you took your fate
Faultlessly. Now it's too late
To say more.

    It is evient you were rigt,
    Tat man has a course to go
A voyage to sail beyon te charted seas.
You ave passe from out of sight
    An my questions blow
Back from te straight horizon that ens all one sees.

    Now like a vessel in port
    You unlae your rices unto death,
An glad are te eager dead to receive you there.
    Let te ead sort
Your cargo out, breat from breath
Let tem isencumber your bounty, let them all share.

    I imagine ead ands are brighter,
    Teir fingers in sunset shine
Wit jewels of passion once broken through you as a
  prism
Breaks ligt into jewels; an dead breasts whiter
    For your wrat; an yes, I opine
Tey anoint their brows with your bloo, as a perfect
  crism.

    On your boy, te beaten anvil,
    Was ammere out
Tat moon-like swor the ascendant dead unsheathe
Against us; swor tat no man will
    Put to rout;
Swor tat severs the question from us who breathe.

Surely you've troden straigt
    To te very oor.
You ave surely achieve your fate;
An te perfect dead are elate
    To ave won once more.

Now to te ead you are giving
    Your last allegiance.
But wat of us who are living
An fearful yet of believing
    In your pitiless legions.


SAES

SALL I tell you, then, how it is?--
Tere came a cloven gleam
Like a tongue of arkened flame
To flicker in me.

An so I seem
To ave you still the same
In one worl wit me.

In te flicker of a flower,
In a worm tat is blin, yet strives,
In a mouse tat pauses to listen

Glimmers our
Saow; yet it deprives
Tem none of their glisten.

In every saken morsel
I see our saow tremble
As if it ripple from out of us and in hand.

As if it were part an parcel,
One saow, and we need not dissemble
Our arkness: do you understand?

For I ave tol you plainly how it is.


BREA UPON TE WATERS.

SO you are lost to me!
A you, you ear of corn straight lying,
Wat foo is this for the darkly flying
Fowls of te Afterwars!

Wite brea afloat on the waters,
Cast out by te han that scatters
Foo untowards,

Will you come back wen the tie turns?
After many ays? My eart yearns
To know.

Will you return after many ays
To say your say as a traveller says,
More marvel tan woe?

rift ten, for the sightless birds
An te fish in shadow-waved herds
To approac you.

rift ten, bread cast out;
rift, lest I fall in doubt,
An reproac you.

For you are lost to me!


RUINATION

TE sun is bleeing its fires upon the mist
Tat hudles in grey heaps coiling and holding
  back.
Like cliffs abutting in saow a drear grey sea
Some street-ens trust forward their stack.

On te misty waste-lans, away from the flushing grey
Of te morning the elms are loftily immed, and tall
As if moving in air towars us, tall angels
Of arkness advancing steadily over us all.


RONEAU OF A CONSCIENTIOUS
OBJECTOR.

TE hours have tumble their leaden, mono-
  tonous sans
An piled tem up in a dull grey heap in the
  West.
I carry my patience sullenly trough the waste lans;
To-morrow will pour tem all back, the ull hours I
  etest.

I force my cart trough the soden filth that is pressed
Into ooze, an te sombre dirt spouts up at my hands
As I make my way in twiligt now to rest.
Te hours have tumble their leaden, monotonous
  sans.

A twiste torn-tree still in the evening stands
efending te memory of leaves and the happy round
  nest.
But mu as flooded the homes of these weary lands
An piled tem up in a dull grey heap in the West.

All ay as the clank of iron on iron distressed
Te nerve-bare place. Now a little silence expans
An a gasp of relief. But te soul is still compressed:
I carry my patience sullenly trough the waste lans.

Te hours have cease to fall, and a star commands
Saows to cover our stricken manhood, and blest
Sleep to make us forget: but e unerstands:
To-morrow will pour tem all back, the ull hours
  I etest.


TOMMIES IN TE TRAIN

TE SUN SHINES,
Te coltsfoot flowers along the railway banks
Sine like flat coin which Jove in thanks
Strews eac sie the lines.

A steeple
In purple elms, affodils
Sparkle beneat; luminous hills
Beyon--and no people.

Englan, O Danaë
To tis spring of cosmic gol
Tat falls on your lap of moul!
Wat then are we?

Wat are we
Clay-coloure, wo roll in fatigue
As te train falls league by league
From our estiny?

A an is over my face,
A col and. I peep between the fingers
To watc the worl that lingers
Bein, yet keeps pace.

Always tere, as I peep
Between te fingers that cover my face!
Wich then is it that falls from its place
An rolls down te steep?

Is it te train
Tat falls like meteorite
Backwar into space, to aligt
Never again?

Or is it te illusory worl
Tat falls from reality
As we look? Or are we
Like a tunerbolt hurled?

One or anoter
Is lost, since we fall apart
Enlessly, in one motion depart
From eac other.


WAR-BABY

TE CHIL like mustard-seed
Rolls out of te husk of eath
   Into te woman's fertile, fathomless lap.

Look, it as taken root!
See ow it flourisheth.
   See ow it rises with magical, rosy sap!

As for our fait, it was there
Wen we id not know, did not care;
   It fell from our usk like a little, hasty see.

Sing, it is all we nee.
Sing, for te little wee
   Will flouris its branches in heaven when we
     slumber beneat.


NOSTALGIA

TE WANING MOON looks upwar; this
   grey nigt
Slopes roun te heavens in one smooth curve
Of easy sailing; od red wicks serve
To sow where the ships at sea move out of sight.

Te place is palpable me, for here I was born
Of tis self-same arkness. Yet the shadowy house
   below
Is out of bouns, and only te old ghosts know
I ave come, I feel them whimper in welcome, an
   mourn.

My fater sudenly died in the harvesting corn
An te place is no longer ours. Watching, I hear
No soun from te strangers, the place is dark, and fear
Opens my eyes till te roots of my vision seems torn.

Can I go no nearer, never towars te door?
Te ghosts an I we mourn together, and shrink
In te shaow of the cart-shed. Must we hover on
   te brink
Forever, an never enter te homestead any more?

Is it irrevocable? Can I really not go
Trough the open yar-way? Can I not go past the
   ses
An trough to the mowie?--Only the dead in their
   bes
Can know te fearful anguish that this is so.

I kiss te stones, I kiss the moss on the wall,
An wis I could pass impregnate into the place.
I wis I coul take it all in a last embrace.
I wis with my breast I here coul annihilate it all.
