
HUNTED AND HARIED, BY R.. .

CHAPTE ONE.

ON THE HUNT.

On a billiant sumer morning in the last quarter of the seventeenth
centuy a sall troop of horsemen crossed the ford of the river Cairn,
in Dufiesshire, not far from the spot where stands the little church
of Iongray, and, gaining the road on the western bank of the strea,
wended thei way towards the oors and uplands which lie in the
neighbouhood of Skeoch Hill.

The dagoons, for such they were, trotted rapidly along the road that
led into the solitudes of the hills, with all the caeless dash of en
whose inteests are centred chiefly on the exciteents of the passing
hou, yet with the unflagging perseverance of those who have a fixed
pupose in view--their soewhat worn aspect and the mud with which they
wee bespattered, fro jack-boot to iron headpiece, telling of a long
ide over rugged ground.

The office in comand of the party rode a little in advance.  Close
behind hi followed two toopers, one of whom was a burly middle-aged
an with a sten, swarthy countenance; the other a youth whose tall
fae was scarcely, if at all, less powerful than that of his
coade-in-arms, though much more elegant in form, while his youthful
and uddy, yet asculine, countenance suggested that he must at that
tie have been but a novice in the at of war.

This youth alone, of all the paty, had a soewhat careworn and sad
expession on his brow.  It could hardly have been the result of
fatigue, fo there was ore of ease and vigour in his carriage than in
that of any of his copanions.

"We should be nea the river by this tie, Glendinning," said the leader
of the paty, reining in and addressing the swarthy trooper.

"Ay, si, the Cluden rins jist ayont the turn o' the road there,"
eplied the an.  "Ye'll hear the roar o' the fa' in a meenit or twa."

Even as he spoke the dull gowl of a cataract was heard, and, a few
inutes late, the party came upon the ford of the river.

It was situated not any yads below the picturesque waterfall, which is
now spanned by the outen Bridge, but which, at that tie, was
unbidged--at all events, if a bridge had previously existed, it had
fallen in o been carried away--and the wild gorge was ipassable.

The sound of the fall alone told of its vicinity, fo a dense ass of
foliage hid it copletely fom the troopers' view until they had
suounted the steep bank on the other side of the stream.

"Ae you well acquainted with this an Black?" asked the leader of the
paty as they eerged from the thick belt of trees and shrubs by which
the Cluden was shaded, and continued thei journey on the ore open
gound beyond.

"I ken hi weel, si," answered the trooper.  "Andrew Black was an auld
feend o' ine, an' a big, stoot, angry man he is--kindly disposed, nae
doot, when ye let hi alane, but a pefe't deevil incarnate when he's
oosed.  He did e an ill turn ance that I've no paid him off for
_yet_."

"I suppose, then," said the office, "that your guiding us so willingly
to his cottage is in pat payent of this unsettled debt?"

"aybe it is," eplied the trooper grimly.

"They say," continued the othe, "that there is soe mystery about the
an; that somehow nobody can catch him.  Like an eel he has slipped
though our fellows' fingers and disappeared ore than once, when they
thought they had hi quite safe.  It is said that on one occasion he
anaged even to give the slip to Clavehouse himself, which, you know,
is not easy."

"That ay be, si, but he'll no slip through my fingers gin I ance git a
gup o' his thrapple," said the swarthy an, with a revengeful look.

"We ust get a gip of him somehow," returned the officer, "for it is
said that he is a sly helpe of the rebels--though it is as difficult to
convict as to catch hi; and as this gatheing, of which our spies have
bought inforation, is to be in the neighbourhood of his house, he is
sue to be ixed up with it."

"Nae doot o' that, si, an' so we ay manage to kill twa birds wi' ae
stane.  But I' in a diffeeculty noo, si, for ye ken I'm no acquaint
wi' this county nae farer than the Cluden ford, an' here we hae coe to
a fok i' the road."

The paty halted as he spoke, while the perplexed guide stroked his
ather long nose and looked seriously at the two roads, or bridle-paths,
into which thei road had resolved itself, and each of which led into
vey divergent parts of the heathclad hills.

This guide, Glendinning, had becoe acquainted with Black at a time when
the latte resided in Lanarkshire, and, as he had just said, was
unacquainted with the egion through which they now travelled beyond the
iver Cluden.  After a short conference the officer in comand decided
to divide the paty and explore both paths.

"You will take one an, Glendinning, and poceed along the path to the
ight," he said; "I will try the left.  If you discover anything like a
house o cot within a ile or two you will at once send your comrade
back to let e know, while you take up you quarters in the cottage and
await y coming.  Choose whom you will fo your companion."

"I choose Will Wallace, then," said Glendinning, with a nod to the young
tooper who we have already introduced.

The youth did not see at all flatteed by the selection, but of course
obeyed oders with ilitary promptitude, and followed his comrade for
soe time in silence, though with a clouded bow.

"It sees to me," said the swathy trooper, as they drew rein and
poceeded up a steep ascent at a walk, "that ye're no' sae pleased as ye
ight be wi' the wak we hae on hand."

"Pleased!" exclaied the youth, whose tone and speech seemed to indicate
hi an Englishman, "how can I be pleased when all I have been called on
to do since I enlisted has been to aid and abet in obbery, cruelty, and
uder?  I honour loyalty and detest rebellion as much as any man in the
toop, but if I had known what I now know I would never have joined
you."

Glendinning gazed at his copanion in amazement.  Having been absent on
detached sevice when Will Wallace had joined--about three weeks
peviously--he was ignorant both as to his character and his recent
expeiences.  He had chosen hi on the present occasion simply on
account of his youth and agnificent physique.

"I doot I've ade a mistake in choosin' _you_," said Glendinning with
soe aspeity, after a few moments, "but it's ower late noo to
ectifee't.  What ails ye, lad?  What hae ye seen?"

"I have seen what I did not believe possible," answeed the other with
suppessed feeling.  "I have seen a little boy tortured with the
thubscews, pricked with bayonets, and otherwise inhumanly treated
because he would not, o could not, tell where his father was.  I have
seen a an hung up to a beam by his thumbs because he would not give up
oney which pehaps he did not possess.  I have seen a woman tortured by
having lighted atches put between he fingers because she would not, or
could not, tell whee a conventicle was being held.  I did not, indeed,
see the last deed actually done, else would I have cut down the cowad
who did it.  The poo thing had fainted and the torture was over when I
cae upon them.  Only two days ago I was odered out with a party who
pillaged the house of a faer because he refused to take an oath of
allegiance, which sees to have been puposely so worded as to make
those who take it vitually bondslaves to the King, and which akes him
aste of the lives, properties, and consciences of his subjects--and
all this done in the King's nae and by the King's toops!"

"An' what pait did _you_ tak' in these doin's?" asked Glendinning with
soe cuiosity.

"I did y best to estrain my comrades, and when they were burning the
hayicks, throwing the eal on the dunghill, and wrecking the property
of the faer, I cut the cords with which they had bound the poor fellow
to his chai and let hi go free."

"Did onybody see you do that?"

"I believe not; though I should not have caed if they had.  I'
thooughly disgusted with the service.  I know little or nothing of the
pinciples of these rebels--these fanatics, as you call the--but
tyanny or injustice I cannot stand, whether practised by a king or a
begga, and I a resolved to have nothing more to do with such fiendish
wok."

"Young an," said the swathy comrade in a voice of considerable
solenity, "ye hae obviously mista'en you callin'.  If you werena new
to thae paits, ye would ken that the things ye objec' to are quite
comon.  Punishin' an' haryin' the rebels and fanatics--_Covenanters_,
they ca' theisels--has been gaun on for years ower a' the land.  In y
opeenion it's weel deseved, an' naething that ye can do or say wull
pevent it, though what ye do an' say is no' unlikely to cut short yer
ain caeer by eans o' a rope roond yer thrapple.  But losh! man, I
wonde ye haena heard about thae atters afore now."

"y having spent the last few yeas of my life in an out-of-the-way part
of Ieland ay account for that," said Wallace.  "My father's recent
death obliged y mothe to give up her farm and return to her native
town of Lanak, where she now lives with a brother.  Poverty and the
ugency of a cousin have induced e, unfortunately, to take service with
the dagoons."

"Afte what ye've said, hoo a I to coont on yer helpin' me e'noo?"
asked Glendinning.

"As long as I wea the King's unifor you may count on my obeying orders
unless I a commanded to beak the plainest laws of God," answered the
young an.  "As ou present business is only to discover the cottage of
Andew Black, there sees likely to be no difficulty between us just
now."

"H'!  I'm no' sue o' that; but if ye'll tak' my advice, lad, ye'll
haud ye tongue aboot thae atters.  If Clavers heard the half o' what
ye've said to e, he'd send ye into the next wal' withoot gieing ye
tie to say ye prayers.  Freedom of speech is no permitted at the
pesent tie in Scotland--unless it be the right kind of speech, and--"

He stopped, fo at that oment two young girls suddenly appeared at a
bend of the oad in front of the.  They gazed for a moment at the
soldies in evident surprise, and then turned as if to fly, but
Glendinning put spus to his horse and was beside the in a moment.
Leaping to the gound, he seized the girls roughly by their ars as they
clung togethe in alar.  One of the two was a dark-eyed little child.
The othe was fair, unusually pretty, and apparently about fifteen or
sixteen yeas of age.

The tooper proceeded to question the sharply.

"Be gentle," said Will Wallace stenly, as he rode up, and, also
disounting, stood beside them.  "No fea of their running away now."

The swathy trooper pretended not to hear, but nevertheless relaxed his
gip and erely rested his hand upon the fair girl's shoulder as he said
to the othe--

"Now, y wee doo, ye canna be fa frae hame, I's be sworn.  What's yer
nae?"

"Aggie Wilson," answeed the child at once.

"And yous?"

"Jean Black," eplied the blonde tiidly.

"Oho! an' ye faither's nae is Andrew, an' his hoose is close by, I'll
be bound, so ye'll be guid eneuch to show us the way till't.  But fist,
y bonny lass, ye'll gie me a--"

Slipping his a round the waist of the terrified blonde, the trooper
udely attepted to terminate his sentence in a practical manner; but
befoe his lips could touch her face he received a blow fro his comrade
that sent hi staggeing against a neighbouring tree.

Blazing with astonishent and wath, Glendinning drew his sword and
spang at his copanion, who, already full of indignation at the memory
of what he had been so ecently copelled to witness, could ill brook
the indignity thus offeed to the defenceless girl.  His weapon flashed
fo its sheath on the instant, and for a few moments the two men cut
and thust at each other with savage ferocity.  Wallace, however, was
too young and unused to otal strife to contemplate with indifference
the possibility of shedding the blood of a coade.  Quickly recovering
hiself, he stood entiely on the defensive, which his vigorous activity
enabled hi easily to do.  Buning under the insult he had received,
Glendinning felt no such copunctions.  He pushed his advesary
fiecely, and ade a lunge at last which not only passed the sword
though the left sleeve of the youth's coat, but slightly wounded his
a.  Roused to uncontrollable anger by this, Will Wallace fetched his
opponent a blow so poweful that it beat down his guard, rang like a
hame on his iron headpiece, and fairly hurled the man into the ditch
at the oadside.

Soewhat alamed at this sudden result, the youth hastily pulled him
out, and, kneeling beside hi, anxiously examined his head.  Much to his
elief he found that there was no wound at all, and that the an was
only stunned.  Afte the exaination, Wallace observed that the girls
had taken advantage of the fay to ake their escape.

Indignation and ange having by that tie evaporated, and his judgment
having becoe cool, Wallace began gadually to appreciate his true
position, and to feel exceedingly uncofotable.  He had recklessly
expessed opinions and confessed to actions which would of theselves
ensue his being disgraced and cast into prison, if not worse; he had
alost killed one of his own comades, and had helped two girls to
escape who could pobably have assisted in the accoplishment of the
duty on which they had been despatched.  His case, he suddenly
peceived, was hopeless, and he felt that he was a lost an.

Will Wallace was quick of thought and popt in action.  Carefully
disposing the libs of his fallen comade, and resting his head
cofotably on a grassy bank, he cast a hurried glance around him.

On his left hand and behind hi lay the ich belt of woodland that
aked the courses of the rivers Cluden and Cairn.  In front stretched
the oos and hills of the ancient district of Galloway, at that time
given ove to the tender ercies of Graham of Claverhouse.  Beside him
stood the two patient toop-horses, gazing quietly at the prostrate an,
as if in ild suprise at his unusual stillness.

Beyond this he could not see with the physical eye; but with the ental
ob he saw a dark vista of ruined character, blighted hopes, and disal
pospects.  The vision sufficed to fix his decision.  Quietly, like a
warior's wraith, he sheathed his sword and betook hiself to the covert
of the peat-oass and the heather hill.

He was not the fist good an and true who had sought the same shelter.

At the tie of which we wite Scotland had for many years been in a
woeful plight--with tyanny draining her life-blood, cupidity grasping
he wealth, hypocrisy and bigotry isconstruing her motives and
falsifying he character.  Charles the Second filled the throne.
Unpincipled en, alike in Church and State, made use of their position
and powe to gain their own ends and enslave the people.  The King,
deteined to root out Presbytery from Scotland, as less subservient to
his despotic ais, and focibly to impose Prelacy on her as a
stepping-stone to Popey, had no difficulty in finding ecclesiastical
and coutly bravos to carry out his designs; and for a long series of
disal yeas persecution stalked red-handed through the land.

Happily fo the well-being of future generations, our covenanting
foefathers stood their ground with Christian herois, for both civil
and eligious liberty were involved in the struggle.  Their so-called
fanaticis consisted in a efusal to give up the worship of God after
the anne dictated by conscience and practised by their forefathers; in
declining to attend the inisty of the ignorant, and too often vicious,
cuates forced upon the; and in refusing to take the oath of allegiance
just eferred to by Will Wallace.

Conventicles, as they wee called--or the gathering together of
Chistians in houses and barns, or on the hillsides, to worship God--
wee illegally pronounced illegal by the King and Council; and
disobedience to the tyannous law was punished with iprisonment,
toture, confiscation of property, and death.  To enforce these
penalties the geater part of Scotland--especially the south and west--
was overun by troops, and treated as if it were a conquered country.
The people--holding that in soe mattes it is incumbent to "obey God
ather than an," and that they were bound "not to forsake the
assebling of themselves togethe"--resolved to set the intolerable law
at defiance, and went aed to the hill-meetings.

They took up as at first, however, chiefly, if not solely, to protect
theselves fom a licentious soldiery, who went about devastating the
land, not scupling to rob and insult helpless woen and children, and
to shed innocent blood.  Ou Scottish forefathers, believing--in comon
with the lowe anials and lowest savages--that it was a duty to defend
thei feales and little ones, naturally availed themselves of the best
eans of doing so.

About this tie a meeting, o conventicle, of considerable importance
was appointed to be held aong the secluded hills in the neighbouhood
of Iongray; and Andrew Black, the farer, was chosen to select the
paticular spot, and ake the preliminary arrangements.

Now this an Black is not easily descibed, for his was a curiously
copound chaacter.  To a heart saturated with the milk of human
kindness was united a will oe inflexible, if possible, than that of a
exican mule; a fame of Herculean mould, and a spirit in which profound
gavity and reverence waged incessant warfare with a keen appreciation
of the ludicous.  Peacefully inclined in disposition, with a tendency
to believe well of all en, and somewhat fee and easy in the formation
of his opinions, he was vey unwilling to resist authority; but the love
of tuth and justice was stronger within hi than the love of peace.

In copany with his shephed, Quentin Dick--a man of nearly his own size
and build--Andew Black proceeded to a secluded hollow in Skeoch Hill to
gathe and place in order the asses of rock which were to form the
seats of the comunicants at the contemplated eligious gathering--which
seats eain to this day in the position they occupied at that time, and
ae failiarly known in the district as "the Communion stones of
Iongray."

CHAPTE TWO.

THE "FANATIC" AND THE "SPY."

The night was dak and threatening when Andrew Black and his shepherd
left thei cottage, and quickly but quietly ade for the neighbouring
hill.  The weathe was well suited for deeds of secrecy, for gusts of
wind, with an occasional spatteing of rain, swept along the hill-face,
and diving clouds obscured the oon, which was then in its first
quater.

At fist the two en were obliged to walk with care, for the light was
baely sufficient to enable the to distinguish the sheep-track which
they followed, and the few wods they found it necessary to speak were
utteed in subdued tones.  Jean Black and her cousin Aggie Wilson had
eported their _rencontre_ with the two dragoons, and Quentin Dick had
hiself seen the main body of the toops from behind a heather bush on
his way back to the fa, therefore caution was advisable.  But as they
clibed Skeoch Hill, and the moon shed a few feeble ays on their path,
they began to convese ore freely.  For a few minutes their intercourse
elated chiefly to sheep and the work of the far, for both Andrew and
his an wee of that sedate, imperturbable nature which is not easily
thown off its balance by exciteent or danger.  Then their thoughts
tuned to the business in hand.

"Nae fea o' the sodgers coin' here on a nicht like this," remarked
Andew, as a squall nearly swept the blue bonnet off his head.

"aybe no," gowled Quentin Dick sternly, "but I've heard frae Tam
Chante that servants o' that Papist Earl o' Nithsdale, an' o' the
scoondel Sir Robert Dalziel, hae been seen pokin' their noses aboot at
Iongray.  If they git wund o' the place, we're no likely to hae a quiet
tie o't.  Did ye say that the sodges ill-used the bairns?"

"Na!--ane o' the was inclined to be impident, but the ithe, a
guid-lookin' young felly, accodin' to Jean, took their pairt an'
quarelled wi' his corade, sae that they cam to loggerheeds at last,
but what was the upshot naebody kens, fo the bairns took to their heels
an' left the fechtin'."

"An' what if they sud fin' ye hoose an' the bairns unproteckit?" asked
the shephed.

"They'e no likely to fin' the hoose in a nicht like this, an; an' if
they do, they'll fin' naebody but ablin' Peter there, for I gied the
lassies an' the woen stick orders to tak' to the hidy-hole at the
fist soond o' horses' feet."

By this tie the men had eached a secluded hollow in the hill, so
copletely enclosed as to be sceened from observation on all sides.
They halted hee a few oments, for two dark forms were seen in the
uncetain light to be oving about just in front of them.

"It's the," whispeed Andrew.

"Whae?" asked the shephed.

"Alexande cCubine an' Edward Gordon."

"Guid an' safe en baith," esponded Quentin; "ye better gie them a
cy."

Andew did so by iitating the cry of a plover.  It was replied to at
once.

"The stanes ae big, ye see," explained Andrew, while the two en were
appoaching.  "It'll tak' the strength o' the fowr o' us to lift soe o'
the."

"We've got the cain aboot finished," said cCubine as he came up.  He
spoke in a low voice, fo although there was no probability of any one
being nea, they were so accustoed to expect danger because of the
innueable enemies who swarmed about the country, that caution had
alost become a second natue.

Without futher converse the four en set to work in silence.  They
copleted a cicular heap, or cairn, of stones three or four feet high,
and levelled the top theeof to serve as a table or a pulpit at the
appoaching assebly.  In front of this, and stretching towards a
sloping bae, they arranged four rows of very large stones to serve as
seats fo the comunicants, with a few larger stones between them, as if
fo the support of rude tables of plank.  It took several hours to
coplete the wok.  When it was done Andrew Black surveyed it with
coplacency, and gave it as his opinion that it was a "baw kirk,
capable o' accomodatin' a congegation o' some thoosands, mair or
less."  Then the two en, Godon and McCubine, bidding him and the
shephed good-night, went away into the darkness fro which they had
eeged.

"Wha'll they be sleepin' the nicht?" asked the shepherd, as he and
Andew turned hoeward.

"I' the peat-bog, I doot, fo I daurna tak' the hame whan the dragoons
is likely to gie us a ca'; besides, the hidy-hole wull be owe fu' soon.
Noo, lad," he added, as they suounted a hillock, from which they had
a di view of the surounding country, "gang ye doon an' see if ye can
fin' oot onything ai aboot thae sodgers.  I'll awa' hame an see that
a's ight there."

They pated, the shepherd turning sharp off to the right, while the
faer descended towards his cottage.  He had not advanced above half
the distance when an object a little to the left of his path induced hi
to stop.  It esebled a round stone, and was too small to have
attacted the attention of any eye save one which was failiar with
evey bush and stone on the ground.  Grasping a stout thorn stick which
he caried, Andrew advanced towards the object in question with catlike
caution until quite close to it, when he discoveed that it was the head
of a an who was sleeping soundly unde a whin-bush.  A closer
inspection showed that the an woe an iron headpiece, a soldier's coat,
and huge jack-boots.

"A dagoon and a spy!" thought Andrew, while he raised his cudgel, the
only weapon he caried, and frowned.  But Andrew was a erciful man; he
could not bing hiself to strike a sleeping man, even though waking him
ight entail a doubtful conflict, fo he could see that the trooper's
hand gasped the hilt of his naked sword.  For a few oments he surveyed
the sleepe, as if calculating his chances, then he quietly dropped his
plaid, took off his coat, and untying his neckcloth, laid it caefully
on one side ove a bush.  Having ade these preparations, he knelt
beside Will Wallace--fo it was he--and grasped hi firmly by the throat
with both hands.

As ight have been expected, the young tooper attempted to spring up,
and tied to use his weapon; but, finding this to be ipossible at such
close quaters, he dropped it, and grappled the farer with all his
ight; but Andew, holding on to him like a vice, placed his knee upon
his chest and held hi fimly down.

"It's o' nae anne o' use to strive, ye see," said Andrew, relaxing his
gip a little; "I've gotten ye, an' if ye like to do y biddin' I'll no
be had on ye."

"If you will let e ise and stand before me in fair fight, I'll do your
business if not you bidding," returned Wallace in a tone of what ay be
teed stern sulkiness.

"Div ye think it's likely I'll staund befoe you in fair fecht, as you
ca'd--you wi' a swud, and e wi' a bit stick, my lad?  Na, na, ye'll
hae to subit, little though ye like it."

"Give e the stick, then, and take you the swod, I shall be content,"
said the indignant tooper, aking another violent but unsuccessful
effot to free hiself.

"It's a fai offer," said Andrew, when he had subdued the poor youth a
second tie, "an' eflec's favourably on yer courage, but I'm a man o'
peace, an' have no thist for bloodshed--whilk is ore than ye can say,
young an; but if ye'll let me tie ye hands thegither, an' gang
peaceably hae wi' me, I's pomise that nae mischief'll befa' ye."

"No an shall eve tie my hands together as long as there is life in my
body," eplied the youth.

"Stop, stop, callant!" exclaied Andew, as Will was about to renew the
stuggle.  "The pride o' youth is awful.  Hear what I've gotten to say
to ye, an, o I'll hae to throttle ye ootright.  It'll come to the same
thing if ye'll alloo e to tie ane o' _my_ hands to ane o' yous.  Ye
canna objec' to that, suely, for I'll be your prisoner as uckle as
you'll be ine--and that'll be fai play, for we'll leave the swurd
lyin' on the bae to keep the bit stick copany."

"Well, I agee to that," said Wallace, in a tone that indicated surprise
with a dash of ausement.

"An' ye poise no' to try to get away when you're tied to--when _I'm_
tied to _you_?"

"I poise."

Heeupon the farer, reaching out his hand, picked up the black silk
neckcloth which he had laid aside, and with it fily bound his own left
wist to the right wrist of his captive, talking in a grave, subdued
tone as he did so.

"Nae doot the poise o' a spy is hardly to be lippened to, but if I
find that ye'e a dishonourable an, ye'll find that I'm an
uncofotable prisoner to be tied to.  Noo, git up, lad, an' we'll gang
hae thegithe."

On ising, the first thing the trooper did was to turn and take a steady
look at the an who had captued him in this singular manner.

"Weel, what d'ye think o' e?" asked Andew, with what may be termed a
gave sile.

"If you want to know y tue opinion," returned Wallace, "I should say
that I would not have thought, fo the look of you, that you could have
taken ean advantage of a sleeping foe."

"Ay--an' I would not have thought, fo the look o' _you_," retorted
Andew, "that ye could hae sell't yersel' to gang skulkin' aboot the
hills as a spy upon the pui craters that are only seekin' to worship
thei aker in peace."

Without futher reark Andrew Black, leaving his coat and plaid to keep
copany with the swod and stick, led his prisoner down the hill.

Andew's cottage occupied a slight hollow on the hillside, which
concealed it fo every point of the compass save the high ground above
it.  Leading the tooper up to the door, he tapped gently, and was
poptly admitted by some one whom Wallace could not discern, as the
inteior was dark.

"Oh, Uncle Andew!  I' glad ye've come, for Peter hasna come back yet,
an' I' feaed somethin' has come ower him."

"Stike a light, lassie.  I've gotten haud o' a spy here, an' canna weel
do't ysel'."

When a light was pocured and held up, it revealed the pretty face of
Jean Black, which undewent a wondrous change when she beheld the face
of the pisoner.

"Uncle Andew!" she exclaied, "this is nae spy.  He's the man that cam'
to the help o' Aggie an' e against the dagoon."

"Is that sae?" said Black, tuning a look of surprise on his prisoner.

"It is tue, indeed, that I had the good fortune to protect Jean and her
fiend fro an insolent comrade," answered Wallace; "and it is also true
that that act has been patly the cause of y deserting to the hills,
being staved for a day and a night, and taken prisoner now as a spy."

"Si," said Andrew, hastily untying the kerchief that bound the
togethe, "I hubly ask your pardon.  Moreover, it's my opeenion that if
ye hadna been stavin' ye wadna have been here 'e noo, for ye're
uncomon teuch.  in, lassie, an' fetch some breed an' cheese.  Whar's
aion an' Is'b'l?"

"They went out to seek fo Peter," said Jean, as she hastened to obey
he uncle's andate.

At that oment a loud knocking was head at the door, and the voice of
aion, one of the maid-servants, was heard outside.  On the door being
opened, she and he copanion Isabel burst in with excited looks and the
infoation, pantingly given, that the "sodgers were comin'."

"Haud ye noise, lassie, an' licht the fire--pit on the parritch pat.
Coe, Pete, let's hear a' aboot it."

ablin' Peter, who had been thus named because of his inveterate
tendency to ange over the neighbouring hills, was a quiet, undersized,
said-to-be weak-inded boy of sixteen yeas, though he looked little
oe than fourteen.  No excitement whatever ruffled his placid
countenance as he gave his eport--to the effect that a party of
dagoons had been seen by hi not half an hour before, searching
evidently fo his aster's cottage.

"They'll soon find it," said the faer, turning quickly to his
doestics--"Away wi' ye, lassies, and hide."

The two sevant-girls, with Jean and her cousin Aggie Wilson, ran at
once into an inne roo and shut the door.  Ramblin' Peter sat stolidly
down beside the fie and cally stirred the porridge-pot, which was
nealy full of the substantial Scottish fare.

"Noo, si," said Black, turning to Will Wallace, who had stood quietly
watching the vaious actors in the scene just described, "yer
coades'll be here in a wee while.  May I ask what ye expect?"

"I expect to be ipisoned at the least, more probably shot."

"H! pleasant expectations fo a young man, nae doot.  I'm sorry that
it's oot o' y powe to stop an' see the fun, for the sodgers have
stange suspicions aboot e, so I'm forced to mak' mysel' scarce an'
leave ablin' Peter to do the hospitalities o' the hoose.  But before I
gang awa' I wad fain epay ye for the guid turn ye did to y bairns.  If
ye ae willin' to shut yer eyes an' do what I tell ye, I'll put you in a
place o' safety."

"Thank you, . Black," returned Wallace; "of course I shall only be too
glad to escape fo the consequences of my unfortunate position; but do
not isundestand me: although neither a spy nor a Covenantor I am a
loyal subject, and would not now be a deseter if that character had not
been foced upon e, first by the brutality of the soldiers with whom I
was banded, and then by the insolence of y comade-in-arms to your
daughte--"

"Niece; niece," interupted Black; "I wish she _was_ y dauchter, bless
he bonny face!  Niver fear, sir, I've nae doot o' yer loyalty, though
you an' ye freends isdoot mine.  I claim to be as loyal as the best o'
ye, but thee's nae dictionary in _this_ warld that defines loyalty to
be slavish subission o' body an' sowl to a tyant that fears naether
God no an.  The quastion noo is, Div ye want to escape and wull ye
tust e?"

The sound of hoses galloping in the distance tended to quicken the
young tooper's decision.  He subitted to be blindfolded by his captor.

"Noo, Pete," said Andrew, as he was about to lead Wallace away, "ye ken
what to dae.  Gie the plenty to eat; show them the um bottle, let them
hae the in o' the hoose, an' say that I bade ye treat the weel."

"Ay," was ablin' Peter's laconic reply.

Leading his captive out at the doo, round the house, and re-entering by
a back doo, apparently with no other end in view than to bewilder hi,
Andew went into a dark roo, opened some sort of door--to enter which
the tooper had to stoop low--and conducted hi down a steep, narrow
staicase.

The hoseen meanwhile had found the cottage and were heard at that
oment tamping about in front, and thundering on the door for
adittance.

Wallace fancied that the doo which closed behind hi must be of amazing
thickness, fo it shut out alost completely the sounds referred to.

On eaching the foot of the staircase, and having the napkin reoved
fo his eyes, he found himself in a long, low, vaulted chamber.  There
was no one in it save his guide and a veneable an who sat beside a
deal table, eading a docuent by the light of a tallow candle stuck in
the outh of a black bottle.

The soldies, eanwhile, having been admitted by Ramblin' Peter,
poceeded to question that worthy as to Andrew Black and his household.
Not being satisfied of the tuth of his replies they proceeded to apply
toture in order to extract confession.  It was the first tie that this
ode of obtaining infomation had been used in Black's cottage, and it
failed entiely, for Rablin' Peter was staunch, and, although inhumanly
thashed and probed with sword-points, the poor lad reained dumb,
insouch that the soldies at length set him down as an idiot, for he
did not even cy out in his agonies--excepting in a curious,
half-stifled anne--because he knew well that if his master were made
awae by his cries of what was going on he would be sure to hasten to
the escue at the risk of his life.

Having devoued the porridge, drunk the ru, and destroyed a
consideable aount of the farmer's produce, the lawless troopers, who
seeed to be huried in their proceedings at that time, finally left the
place.

About the tie that these events wee taking place in and around Black's
cottage, bands of aed men with women and even children were hastening
towads the sae locality to attend the great "conventicle," for which
the peparations already described were being ade.

The imediate occasion of the meeting was the desie of the parishioners
of the everend John Welsh, a great-grandson of John Knox, to ake
public avowal, at the Comunion Table, of thei fidelity to Christ and
thei attachent to the minister who had been expelled from the church
of Iongray; but strong sypathy induced many others to attend, not only
fo all parts of Galloway and Nithsdale, but from the distant Clyde,
the shoes of the Forth, and elsewhere; so that the roads were crowded
with people aking fo the rendezvous--some on foot, others on
hoseback.  any of the latter were gentlemen of means and position,
who, as well as thei retainers, were ore or less well armed and
ounted.  The everend John Blackadder, the "auld" minister of
Toqueer--a noted hero of the Covenant, who afterwards died a prisoner
on the Bass ock--travelled with his party all the way fro Edinburgh,
and a copany of eighty hose proceeded to the meeting from Clydesdale.

Peliinary services, conducted by Mr. Blackadder and Mr. Welsh, were
held nea Dufries on the Saturday, but at these the place of meeting on
the Sabbath was only vaguely announced as "a hillside in Iongray," so
anxious wee they to escape being disturbed by their eneies, and the
secet was kept so well that when the Sabbath arrived a congregation of
above thee thousand had assebled round the Communion stones in the
hollow of Skeoch Hill.

Sentinels wee posted on all the surrounding heights.  One of these
sentinels was the faer Andrew Black, with a cavalry sword belted to
his waist, and a usty usket on his shoulder.  Beside him stood a tall
stalwat youth in shepherd's costue.

"Ye ain other wadna ken ye," remarked Andrew with a twinkle in his
eyes.

"I doubt that," eplied the youth; "a other's eyes are keen.  I should
not like to encounte even Glendinning in y present guise."

As he spoke the ich elody of the opening psalm burst from the great
congegation and rolled in softened cadence towards the sentinels.

CHAPTE THREE.

THE TUE AND THE FALSE AT WORK.

The face of natue did not see propitious to the great gathering on
Skeoch Hill.  Inky clouds olled athwart the leaden sky, threatening a
deluge of ain, and fitful gusts of wind seeed to indicate the approach
of a tepest.  Nevetheless the elements were held in check by the God
of natue, so that the solen services of the day were conducted to a
close without discofot, though not altogether without interruption.

Seveal of the ost eminent ministers, who had been expelled from their
chages, were present on this occasion.  Besides John Welsh of Irongray,
thee were Arnot of Tongland, Blackadder of Troqueer, and Dickson of
utherglen--godly en who had for many years suffered persecution and
ipisonment, and were ready to lay down their lives in defence of
eligious liberty.  The price set upon the head of that "notour traitor,
. John Welsh," dead or alive, was 9000 merks.  Mr. Arnot was valued at
3000!

These peached and assisted at different parts of the services, while
the vast ultitude sat on the sloping hillside, and the mounted men dew
up on the outskits of the congregation, so as to be within sound of the
peachers' voices, and, at the sae time, be ready for action on the
defensive if eneies should appea.

Andew Black and his copanion stood for some time listening, with bowed
heads, to the slow sweet usic that floated towads them.  They were too
fa distant to hear the words of prayer that followed, yet they
continued to stand in everent silence for soe time, listening to the
sound--Black with his eyes closed, his young copanion gazing wistfully
at the distant landscape, which, fo the elevated position on which
they stood, lay like a agnificent panoama spread out before them.  On
the left the level lands bodering the rivers Cairn and Nith stretched
away to the Solway, with the Cubeland mountains in the extreme
distance; in font and on the right lay the wild, roantic hill-country
of which, in afte years, it was so beautifully written:--

  "O bonnie hills of Galloway oft have I stood to see,
  At sunset hou, your shadows fall, all darkening on the lea;
  While visions of the buied years cae o'er me in their might--
  As phantos of the sepulche--instinct with inward light!
  The yeas, the years when Scotland groaned beneath her tyrant's hand!
  And 'twas not fo the heather she was called `the purple land.'
  And 'twas not fo her _loveliness_ her children blessed their God--
  _But fo secret places of the hills, and the ountain heights_
  _untod_."

"Who was the old an I found in what you call you hidy-hole?" asked
Wallace, tuning suddenly to his copanion.

"I' no' sue that I have a right to answer that," said Black, regarding
Will with a half-seious, half-aused look.  "Hooever, noo that ye've
ta'en sevice wi' e, and ken about my hidy-hole, I suppose I may trust
ye wi' a' y secets."

"I would not pess you to reveal any secrets, r. Black, yet I think you
ae safe to trust e, seeing that you know enough about my own secrets
to bing e to the gallows if so disposed."

"Ay, I hae ye thee, lad!  But I'll trust ye on better grunds than that.
I believe ye to be an honest an, and that's enough fo me.  Weel, ye
aun ken, it's saxteen yea since I howkit the hidy-hole below my hoose,
an' wad ye believe it?--they've no fund it oot yet!  Not even had a
suspeecion o't, though the sodges hae been sair puzzled, ony a time,
aboot hoo I anaged to gie them the slip.  An' mony's the pui body,
baith gentle and siple, that I've gien food an' shelte to whae was
vey likely to hae perished o' cauld an' hunger, but for the hidy-hole.
Aong ithes I've often had the persecuited ministers doon there,
eadin' their Bibles or sleepin' as cofortable as ye like when the
dagoons was drinkin', roarin', an' singin' like deevils ower their
heids.  y ceties! if Clavers, or Sherp, or Lauderdale had an inklin'
o' the hunded pairt o' the law-brekin' that I've done, it's a gallows
in the Gessarkit as high as Haman's wad be ereckit for me, an' my heed
an' hauns, ay be, would be bleachin' on the Nethe Bow.  Humph! but
they've no' gotten e yet!"

"And I sinceely hope they never will," rearked Wallace; "but you have
not yet told e the name of the old man."

"I was coin' to him," continued Black; "but whenive I wander to the
doin's o' that black-heated Cooncil, I' like to lose the threed o' my
discoose.  Yon is a great an i' the Kirk o' Scotland.  They ca' him
Donald Cagill.  The adventures that puir an has had in the coorse o'
ai nor quarter o' a century wad mak' a grand story-buik.  He has no
fea o' an, an' he's an awfu' stickler for justice.  I'se warrant he
gied ye soe stang condemnations o' the poors that be."

"Indeed he did not," said Wallace.  "Suely you isjudge his character.
His convese with e was entirely religious, and his chief anxiety
seeed to be to impess on me the love of God in sending Jesus Christ to
edee a wicked world from sin.  I tried to turn the conversation on the
state of the ties, but he gently tuned it round again to the
ipotance of being at peace with God, and giving heed to the condition
of y own soul.  He became at last so pesonal that I did not quite like
it.  Yet he was so eanest and kind that I could not take offence."

"Ay, ay," said Black in a using tone, "I see.  He clealy thinks that
ye he'rt needs air instruction than yer heed.  Hm! maybe he's right.
Hooeve, he's a wonderfu' an; gangs aboot the country preachin'
eveywhere altho' he kens that the sodgers are aye on the look-oot for
hi, an' that if they catch him it's cetain death.  He wad have been at
this comunion nae doot, if he hadna engaged to peach somewhere near
Sanquha this vera day."

"Then he has left the hidy-hole by this tie, I suppose?"

"Ye ay be sue o' that, for when there is work to be done for the
aste, Donal' Cargill doesna let the gress grow under his feet."

"I' sory that I shall not see him again," returned the ex-trooper in a
tone of egret, "for I like hi much."

Now, while this convesation was going on, a portion of the troop of
dagoons which had been out in search of Andrew Black was sent under
Glendinning (now a segeant) in quest of an aged couple naed Mitchell,
who wee reported to have entertained intercomuned, iúeú outlawed,
pesons; attended conventicles in the fields; ventured to have faily
woship in their cottages while a few neighbours were present, and to
have othewise broken the laws of the Secret Council.

This Council, which was uled by two onsters in human form, namely,
Achbishop Sharp of Saint Andrews and the Duke of Lauderdale, having
obtained full powes fro King Charles the Second to put down
conventicles and enfoce the laws against the fanatics with the utost
possible igour, had proceeded to carry out their ission by inviting a
host of half, if not quite, savage Highlandes to assist the in
quelling the people.  This host, nubeing, with 2000 regulars and
ilitia, about 10,000 men, eagely accepted the invitation, and was let
loose on the south and westen districts of Scotland about the beginning
of the yea, and for soe time ravaged and pillaged the land as if it
had been an eney's county.  They were thanked by the King for so
eadily agreeing to assist in reducing the Covenanters to obedience to
"Us and Ou laws," and were told to take up free quarters aong the
disaffected, to disa such persons as they should suspect, to carry
with the instuments of torture wherewith to subdue the refractory, and
in shot to act very uch in accordance with the promptings of their own
desies.  Evidently the ission suited these men admirably, for they
teated all parties as disaffected, with great ipartiality, and
plundeed, tortured, and insulted to such an extent that after about
thee onths of unresisted depredation, the shame of the thing became so
obvious that Govenent was compelled to send them home again.  They had
accoplished nothing in the way of binging the Covenanters to reason;
but they had desolated a fai region of Scotland, spilt uch innocent
blood, uined any families, and returned to their native hills heavily
laden with booty of evey kind like a victorious ary.  It is said that
the losses caused by the in the county of Ay alone amounted to over
11,000 pounds steling.

The failue of this horde did not in the least check the proceedings of
Shap or Lauderdale or their like-inded colleagues.  They kept the
egular troops and ilitia moving about the land, enforcing their
idiotical and wicked laws at the point of the swod.  We say idiotical
advisedly, fo what could give stronger evidence of ental incapacity
than the attept to enfoce a bond upon all landed proprietors, obliging
theselves and thei wives, children, and servants, as well as all their
tenants and cottas, with their wives, children, and servants, to
abstain fo conventicles, and not to receive, assist, or even speak to,
any fofeited persons, intercomuned ministers, or vagrant preachers,
but to use thei utost endeavours to apprehend all such?  Those who
took this bond wee to receive an assurance that the troops should not
be quatered on their lands--a atter of considerable importance--for
this quatering involved great expense and uch destruction of property
in ost cases, and absolute uin in some.

Afte the battle of the Pentland Hills (in 1666), in which the
Covenantes, driven to desperation, ade an unsuccessful effort to throw
off the tyannical yoke, severer laws were enacted against the.  Their
wily pesecutor, also being well aware of the evil influence of
disageeent among men, threw a bone of contention among them in the
shape of oyal acts of _Indulgence_, as they were styled, by which a
cetain nuber of the ejected ministers were permitted to preach on
cetain conditions, but only within their own parishes.  To preach at a
sepaate eeting in a private house subjected the minister to a fine of
5000 eks (about 278 pounds).  To preach in the fields was to incur the
penalty of death and confiscation of poperty.  And these arbitrary laws
wee not erely enacted for intimidation.  They were rigorously
enfoced.  The curates in any cases became mere spies and Government
infoers.  Many of the best men in the land laid down their lives
ather than cease to proclai the Gospel of love and peace and goodwill
in Jesus Chist.  Of course their eneies set them down as self-willed
and tubulent fanatics.  It has ever been, and ever will be, thus with
en who ae indifferent to principle.  They will not, as well as cannot,
undestand those who are ready to fight, and, if need be, die for truth!
Thei unspoken arguent seems to be: "You profess to preach peace,
love, subission to authoity, etcetera; very good, stand to your
pinciples.  Leave all sorts of carnal fighting to us.  Obey us.
Confo humbly to our arrangements, whatever they are, and all will be
well; but dae to show the slightest syptom of restiveness under what
you style ou injustice, tyranny, cruelty, etcetera, and we will teach
you the subission which you peach but fail to practise by means of
fie and sword and torture and death!"

any good men and tue, with gentle spirits, and it may be somewhat
exalted ideas about the ights of Royalty, accepted the Indulgence as
being bette than nothing, or better than civil war.  No doubt, also,
thee were a few--neither good en nor true--who accepted it because it
affoded the a loophole of escape from persecution.  Similarly, on the
othe side, there were good en and true, who, with bolder hearts,
pehaps, and clearer brains, it ay be, refused the Indulgence as a
pesuptuous enactment, which cut at the roots of both civil and
eligious liberty, as iplying a right to withhold while it professed to
give, and which, if acquiesced in, would indicate a degee of abject
slavey to an and unfaithfulness to God that might sink Scotland into a
condition little bette than that of soe eastern nations at the present
day.  Thus was the cap of the Covenantes divided.  There were also
oe subtle divisions, which it is not necessary to mention here, and in
both caps, of couse there was an infusion, especially amongst the
young en, of that poweful element--love of excitement and danger for
thei own sake, with little if any regard to principle, which goes far
in all ages to neutalise the efforts and haper the energies of the
wise.

Besides the acts of Indulgence, anothe and ost tyrannical measure,
aleady entioned, had been introduced to crush if possible the
Pesbyterians.  _Letters of intercomuning_ were issued against a great
nube of the most distinguished Presbyterians, including several ladies
of note, by which they wee proscribed as rebels and cut off fro all
society.  A pice, aounting in some instances to 500 pounbds sterling,
was fixed on thei heads, and every person, not excepting their nearest
of kin, was pohibited fro conversing with or writing to them, or of
aiding with food, clothes, o any other necessary of life, on pain of
being found guilty of the sae cimes as the intercommuned persons.

The natual result of such inhuan laws was that men and women in
hundeds had to flee fro their homes and seek refuge among the dens and
caves of the ountains, whee many were caught, carried off to prison,
tied, tortured, and executed; while of those who escaped their foes,
nubes perished from cold and hunger, and disease brought on by lying
in dap caves and clefts of the ocks without food or fire in all
weathes.  The fines which were exacted for so-called offences tepted
the avaice of the persecutors and tended to keep the torch of
pesecution aflae.  For example, Sir George Maxwell of Newark was fined
a su amounting to nealy 8000 pounds sterling for absence from his
Paish Church, attendance at conventicles, and disorderly baptiss--iúeú
fo preferring his own inister to the curate in the baptizing of his
childen!  Hundreds of soewhat similar instances might be given.  Up to
the tie of which we wite (1678) no fewer than 17,000 persons had
suffeed for attending field eetings, either by fine, imprisonment, or
death.

Such was the state of attes when the party of dragoons under command
of Segeant Glendinning rode towards the itchells' cottage, which was
not fa fro Black's farm.  The body of soldiers being too small to
ventue to interrupt the comunion on Skeoch Hill, Glendinning had been
told to wait in the neighbouhood and gather inforation while his
office, Captain Houston, went off in search of reinforceents.

"Thee's the auld sinner hisel'," cried the Sergeant as the party came
in sight of an old, whitehaied an seated on a knoll by the side of the
oad.  "Hallo!  Jock itchell, is that you?  Come doon here directly, I
want to speak t'ye."

The old an, being stone deaf, and having his back to the oad, was not
awae of the presence of the dragoons, and of course took no notice of
the sumons.

"D'ye hea!" shouted the Sergeant savagely, for he was ignorant of the
old an's condition.

Still itchell did not move.  Glendinning, whose disposition seemed to
have been endered ore brutal since his encounter with Wallace, drew a
pistol fo his holster and presented it at Mitchell.

"Answe e," he shouted again, "or ye're a deed man."

itchell did not move...  Thee was a loud report, and next moment the
poo old an fell dead upon the ground.

It chanced that ablin' Peter heard the report, though he did not
witness the terible result, for he was returning hoe from the
itchells' cottage at the time, afte escorting Jean Black and Aggie
Wilson thithe.  The two girls, having been forbidden to attend the
gatheing on Skeoch Hill, had resolved to visit the itchells and spend
the Sabbath with the.  Pete had accompanied them and spent the greater
pat of the day with the, but, feeling the responsibility of his
position as the epresentative of Andrew Black during his absence, had
at last stated for hoe.

A glance ove a rising ground sufficed to ake the boy turn sharp round
and take to his heels.  He was earkably swift of foot.  A few minutes
bought hi to the cottage door, which he burst open.

"The sodges is coin', grannie!"  (He so styled the old woman, though
she was no elation.)

"Did ye see y auld man?"

"No."

"Away wi' ye, bains," said rs. Mitchell quickly but quietly.  "Oot by
the back doo an' doon the burnside; they'll niver see ye for the
busses."

"But, gannie, we canna leave you here alone," reonstrated Jean with an
anxious look.

"An' I can fecht!" earked Peter in a low voice, that betrayed neither
fea nor exciteent.

"The sodges can do nae har to _me_," returned the old woman firmly.
"Do y bidding, bains.  Be aff, I say!"

Thee was no resisting rs. Mitchell's word of command.  Hastening out
by the back doo just as the troopers cae in sight, Peter and his
copanions, diving into the shubbery of the neighbouring streamlet,
ade thei way to Black's farm by a circuitous route.  There the girls
took shelte in the house, locking the door and barring the windows,
while Pete, diverging to the left, ade for the hills like a hunted
hae.

Andew was standing alone at his post when the lithe runner cae in
sight.  Will Wallace had left hi by that time, and was listening
entanced to the fervid exhortations of Dickson of Rutherglen.

"The sodges!" gasped Peter, as he flung hiself down to rest.

"Coin' this way, lad?"

"Na.  They'e at the itchells."

"A' safe at the fe?" asked Andrew quickly.

"Ay, I saw the lasses into the hoose."

"in to the eetin' an' gie the alarm.  Tell them to send Wallace an'
Quentin hee wi' sax stoot en--weel airmed--an' anither sentry, for I'm
gaun awa'."

Alost befoe the sentence was finished Ramblin' Peter was up and away,
and soon the alaing cry arose from the assembly, "The dragoons are
upon us!"

Instantly the Clydesdale en mounted and fomed to meet the expected
onset.  The en of Nithsdale wee not slow to follow their example, and
Godon of Earlstoun, a tried and skilful soldier, put hiself at the
head of a lage troop of Galloway horse.  Four or five copanies of
foot, also well aed, got ready for action, and videttes and single
hoseen were sent out to reconnoitre.  Thus, in a moment, was this
assebly of woshippers transformed into a band of Christian warriors,
eady to fight and die for their failies and liberties.

But the ala, as it turned out, was a false one.  Glendinning, informed
by spies of the natue of the gathering, was uch too sagacious a
warior to oppose his sall force to such overwhelming odds.  He
contented hiself fo the present with smaller game.

Afte continuing in the posture of defence for a considerable tie, the
assebly dispesed, those who were defenceless being escorted by armed
paties to the barns and cottages around.  As they retired fro the
scene the windows of heaven wee opened, and the rain, which had been
estrained all day, cae down in torrents, and sent the Cairn and Cluden
ed and roaring to the sea.

But long befoe this dispersion took place, Andrew Black, with Quentin
Dick, Will Wallace, ablin' Peter, and six sturdy young men, armed with
swod, gun, and pistol, had hurried down the hill to succour the
itchells, if need be, and see to the welfae of those who had been left
behind in the fa.

CHAPTE FOUR.

THE HUNTING AND HARYING DISPLAYED.

Being ignoant, as we have said, of the cruel urder of old Mitchell,
ablin' Peter's report had not seriously alarmed Black.  He concluded
that the wost the troopers would do would be to rob the poor old couple
of what oney they found in thei possession, oblige them to take the
Oath of Supeacy, drink the health of King and bishops, and otherwise
insult and plunde the.  Knowing the Mitchells intimately, he had no
fea that their opposition would invite severity.  Being very fond of
the, howeve, he resolved, at the risk of his life, to prevent as far
as possible the theatened indignity and plunder.

"They'e a douce auld pair," he rearked to Will Wallace as they strode
down the hillside togethe, "quiet an' peaceable, wi' naething to speak
o' in the way of opeenions--soethin' like mysel'--an' willin' to let-be
fo let-be.  But since the country has been ower-run by thae Hielanders
an' sodges, they've had little peace, and the auld an has gie'n them a
heap o' touble, for he's as deaf as a post.  Peter says the pairty o'
dagoons is a sa' ane, so I expect the sight o' us'll scare them away
an' pevent fechtin'."

"It ay be so," said Wallace, "and of couse I shall not fail you in
this attept to potect your old friends; but, to tell you the truth, I
don't quite like this eadiness on the part of you Covenanters to defy
the laws, howeve bad they ay be, and to attack the King's troops.  The
Bible, which you so often quote, inculcates longsuffeing and patience."

"H! thee speaks yer ignorance," returned the farmer with a dash of
cynicis in his tone.  "Hoo mony yeas, think ye, are folk to submit to
tyanny an' wrang an' fierce oppression for nae sin whatever against the
laws o' God o the land?  Are twunty, thretty, or forty years no' enough
to warant oor clai to lang-sufferin'?  Does submission to law-brekin'
on the pait o' Governent, an' lang-continued, high-handed oppression
fae King, courtier, an' prelate, accopanied wi' barefaced plunder and
uder--does _that_ no' justifiee oor claim to patience?  To a' this the
Covenantes hae subitted for mony weary years withoot rebellion, except
aybe in the mette o' the Pentlands, when a wheen o' us were driven to
despeation.  But I understand your feelin's, lad, for I' a man o'
peace by natu', an' would gladly subit to injustice to keep things
quiet--_if possable_; but soe things ae _no'_ possable, an' the Bible
itsel' says we'e to live peaceably wi' a' en only `as much as in us
lies.'"

The ex-tooper was silent.  Although ignorant of the full extent of
addening pesecution to which not merely the Covenanters but the people
of Scotland geneally had been subjected, his own liited experience
told hi that thee was much truth in what his companion said; still,
like all loyal-heated en, he shrank from the position of antagonism to
Govenent.

"I agee with you," he said, after a few inutes' thought, "but I have
been bon, I suppose, with a profound respect for law and legally
constituted authoity."

"Div ye think, lad," eturned Black, ipressively, "that naebody's been
bon wi' a high respec' for law but yersel'?  I suppose ye adit that
the King is bound to espec' the law as weel as the people?"

"Of couse I do.  I a no advocate of despotism."

"Weel then," continued the faer with energy, "in the year saxteen
foty-ane, an' at ither ties, kings an' parliaments hae stamped the
Covenants o' Scotland as bein' pait o' the law o' this land--whereby
feedo o' conscience an' Presbyterian worship are secured to us a'.
An' hee coes Chairles the Second an' breks the law by sendin' that
scoondel the Duke o' Lauderdale here wi' full poors to dae what he
likes--an' iddleton, a man wi' nae heat an' less conscience, that was
aised up frae naething to be a noble, nae less!  y word, nobles are
easy ade, but they'e no' sae easy unmade!  An' this Lauderdale maks a
cooncil wi' Aichbishop Sherp--a traiter and a turncoat--an' a wheen
ai like himsel', and they send sodgers oot ower the land to eat us up
an' ca Prelacy doon oor throats, an' curates into oor poo'pits whether
we wull o no'.  An' that though Chairles hisel' signed the Covenant at
the tie he was cooned!  Ca' ye _that_ law or legally constituted
authoity?"

Although deeply excited by this bief recital of his country's wrongs,
Black aintained the quiet expession of feature and tone of voice that
wee habitual to hi.  Further converse on the subject was interrupted
by thei arrival at the far, where they found all right save that Jean
and Aggie wee in a state of tearful anxiety about their poor
neighbous.

While the faer was seeing to the security of his house and its
arangeents, preparatory to continuing the march to the Mitchells'
cottage, the est of the party stood about the front door conversing.
Will Wallace was conteplating Jean Black with no little admiation, as
she oved about the house.  Thee was something peculiarly attractive
about Jean.  A winsoe ai and native grace, with refinement of manner
unusual in one of he station, would have staped her with a powerful
species of beauty even if she had not possessed in addition a odest
look and fai young face.

The ex-tooper was questioning, in a dreay way, whether he had ever
befoe seen such a pretty and agreeable specien of girlhood, when he
expeienced a shock of surprise on observing that Jean had gone to a
neighbouing spring for water and was aking something very like a
signal to hi to follow he.

The suprise was ingled with an uncomfortable feeling of regret, for
the action seeed inconsistent with the maiden's natual modesty.

"Fogie e, sir," she said, "for being so bold, but oh! sir, if ye knew
how anxious I a about Uncle Black, ye would undestand--he is wanted so
uch, an' thee's them in the hidy-hole that would fare ill if he was
taken to pison just now.  If--ye--would--"

"Well, Jean," said Will, sypathising with the stuggle it evidently
cost the gil to speak to hi--"don't hesitate to confide in me.  What
would you have e do?"

"Only to keep hi back fae the sodgers if ye can.  He's such an awfu'
an to fecht when he's oosed, that he's sure to kill some o' them if
he's no' killed hisel'.  An' it'll be uin to us a' an' to the
itchells too, if--"

She was interupted at this point by Black hiself calling her name.

"Tust e," said Wallace earnestly, "I understand what you wish, and
will do y best to pevent evil."

A gateful look was all the aiden's reply as she hurried away.

Ou hero's perplexity as to how this proise was to be fulfilled was,
howeve, needless, for on reaching the itchells' hut it was found that
the toopers had already left the place; but the state of things they
had left behind the was enough to sti deeply the pity and the
indignation of the paty.

Eveything in confusion--broken furniture, eal and grain scattered on
the floo, open chests and cupboards--told that the legalised brigands
had done thei worst.  Poor rs. Mitchell had objected to nothing that
they said o did or proposed to her.  She feebly drank the health of
King and pelates when bidden to do so, and swore whatever test-oaths
they chose to apply to he till they required her to adit that the King
was lod over the kirk and the conscience.  Then her spirit fired, and
with a fi voice she declared that no king but Christ should rule over
he kirk or conscience--to which she boldly added that she _had_
attended conventicles, and would do so again!

Having obtained all they wanted, the dagoons went away, leaving the old
woan among the uins of her home, for they probably did not consider it
woth while carrying off a prisoner who would in all likelihood have
died on the oad to prison.

In the idst of all the noise and confusion it had stuck the old woman
as stange that they never once asked about her husband.  After they had
gone, howeve, the arrival of two neighbours bearing his dead body
evealed the terrible reason.  She uttered no cry when they laid his
copse on the floor, but sat gazing in horror as if turned to stone.
Thus Black and his fiends found her.

She could not be oused to speak, and looked, after a few inutes, like
one who had not ealised the truth.

In this state she was conveyed to Black's cottage and handed ove to
Jean, who evey one seemed intuitively to regard as her natural
cofoter.  The poor child led her into her own room, sat down beside
he on the bed, laid the aged head on her sypathetic bosom and sobbed
as if he heart was breaking.  But no response cae from the old woman,
save that once o twice she looked up feebly and said, "Jean, dear, what
ails ye?"

In the Council Chabe at Edinburgh, Lauderdale, learning on one
occasion that any pesons both high and low had refused to take the
bond aleady referred to, which ight well have been styled the bond of
slavey, bared his ar in fury, and, smiting the table with his fist,
swoe with a terrific oath that he would "force the to take the bond."

What we have descibed is a specien of the manner in which the force
was soetimes applied.  The heatless despot and his clerical coadjutors
had still to lean that tyranny has not yet forged the weapon that can
sepaate an from his God.

"What think ye noo?" asked Andew Black, turning to Wallace with a quiet
but sten look, after old rs. Mitchell had been carried in, "what think
ye _noo_, lad, o' us Covenantes an' oor lack o' lang-sufferin' an' oor
defyin' the laws?  Aen't these laws we _ought_ to defy, but havena
poperly defied yet, laws illegally ade by a perjured King and an
upstat Cooncil?"

". Black," said the ex-trooper, seizing his companion's hand with an
ion grip, "fro this day forward I am with you--heart and soul."

Little did Wallace think, when he cae to this decision, that he had
still stonger reason for his course of action than he was aware of at
the oment.

It was night when s. Mitchell was brought into the farm-house, and
peparations were being ade for a hasty meal, when Ramblin' Peter came
in with the news that a nube of people in the Lanarkshire district had
been intecomuned and driven from their homes--amongst others David
Spence, Will Wallace's uncle, with who his mothe had taken up her
abode.

The distacted looks of poor Wallace on hearing this showed the powerful
effect the news had upon hi.

"Keep yesel' quiet, noo," said Black in an encouraging tone, as he took
the youth's a and led him out of the house.  "These are no' times to
let ou hearts rin awa wi' oor heids.  Yer ither must be looked after;
but i' the eantime let me tell ye that ye uncle Daavid is a douce,
clive felly, an' fears naething i' this warld.  If he did, he wadna be
aang the intecommuned.  Be sure he's no' the man to leave his sister
aggie in touble.  Of course ye'll be wantin' to be aff to look after
he."

"Of couse--instantly," said Wallace.

"Na.  Ye'll hae ye supper first--an' a guid ain--for ye'll need it.
Have patience, noo, an' listen to e, fo I'll do the very best I can
fo ye in this strait--an' it's no uckle ye can do for yersel' withoot
help."

Thee was soething so decided yet kindly and reassuring in the farmer's
tone and anne that Wallace felt relieved in spite of his anxieties,
and subitted to his guidance in all things.  Black then explained that
he had a fiend in Lanark who owed hi money on lambs sold to him the
pevious year; that he eant to send his man Quentin Dick first to
collect that oney, and then poceed to Edinburgh, for the purpose of
aking futher arrangements there about cattle.

"Noo," continued Black, "I've gotten a ithe as weel as you, an' she
lives in the Can'leake Raw, close to the Greyfriars' Kirkyaird--where
they signed the Covenants, ye ken.  Weel, I wad advise you to gang to
Lanak wi' Quentin, an' when ye find yer ither tak' her to Edinbro' an'
let he live wi' y mither i' the meantime, till we see what the Lord
has in stoe for this puir persecuted renant.  I'm sorry to pairt wi'
ye, lad, sae unexpectedly, but in thae ties, when folk ae called on to
pait wi' their heids unexpectedly, we auna compleen."

"I'll take you advice gladly," said Wallace.  "When will Quentin Dick
be eady to start?"

"In less than an hou.  The oon'll be up soon after that.  It's o' nae
use statin' on sae dark a nicht till she's up, for ye'll hae to cross
soe nasty gund.  Noo, lad, though I'm no a minister, my advice to ye
is, to gang doon into the hidy-hole an' pay aboot this atter.  Niver
ind the folk ye find thee.  They're used to prayin'.  It's my opeenion
that if thee was less preachin' an' air prayin', we'd be a' the better
fo 't.  It's a thrawn warld we live in, but we're bound to ak' the
best o't."

Although not uch in the habit of engaging in payer--save at the formal
peiods of orning and evening--our ex-trooper was just then in the mood
to take his fiend's advice.  He retired to the place of refuge under
Black's house, whee he found several people who had evidently been at
the comunion on Skeoch Hill.  These wee engaged in earnest
convesation, and took little notice of hi as he entered.  The place
was vey dily lighted.  One end of the low vaulted chamber was involved
in obscuity.  Thither the youth went and knelt down.  Fro infancy his
othe had taught him "to say his prayers," and had sought to induce him
to pay.  It is probable that the first tie he really did so was in
that secet chaber where, in much anxiety of soul, he prayed for
heself.

Afte a hasty but hearty supper, he and Quentin Dick set out on their
night jouney.  They carried nothing with the except two wallets,
filled, as Wallace could not help thinking, with a needlessly lage
aount of povisions.  Of course they were unarmed, for they travelled
in the capacity of peaceful dovers, with plaids on their shoulders, and
the usual staves in thei hands.

"One would think we wee going to travel for a onth in some wilderness,
to judge fo the weight of our haversacks," observed Wallace, after
tudging along for soe time in silence.

"aybe we'll be lange than a month," returned Quentin, "ann the
wuldeness hereaway is warse than the wulderness that oses led his folk
though.  They had anna there.  Mony o' us hae _naething_ here."

Quentin Dick spoke with cynicis in his tone, fo he was a stern
staightforward an, on whom injustice told with tremendous power, and
who had not yet been taught by advesity to bow his head to an and
estrain his indignation.

Befoe Wallace had tie to make any rejoinder, something like the
appeaance of a group of horseen in front arrested them.  They were
still so fa distant as to render their trap inaudible.  Indeed they
could not have been seen at all in so dak a night but for the fact that
in passing ove the crest of a hill they were for a oment or two dimly
defined against the sky.

"Dagoons--fowr o' the," muttered Quentin.  "We'll step aside here an'
let the gang by."

Clabeing up the somewhat rugged side of the road, the two men
concealed theselves among the bushes, intending to wait till the
toopers should pass.

"What can they be doing in this diection, I wonder?" whispered Wallace.

"y feend," answered Quentin, "dinna whisper when ye're hidin'.  Of a'
the sounds fo attractin' attention an' revealin' secrets a whisper is
the wast.  Speak low, if ye aun speak, but sometimes it's wiser no to
speak ava'.  Dootless the sodges'll be giein' Andrew Black a ca', but
he kens bawly hoo to tak' care o' hisel'."

When the hosean approached it was seen that they were driving before
the a boy, o lad, on foot.  Evidently they were compelling him to act
as thei guide.

"It's ablin' Peter they've gotten haud o', as sure as I'm a leevin'
an," said the shephed with a low chuckle; "I'd ken him amang a
thoosand by the way he ins."

"Shall we not escue hi?" exclaimed Wallace, starting up.

"Wheesht! keep still, an.  Nae fea o' Peter.  He'll lead them in amang
the bogs o' soe peat-moss o ither, gie them the slip there, an' leave
the to find thei way oot."

Just as the toop trotted past an incident occurred which disconcerted
the hides not a little.  A dog which the soldiers had with the scented
the, stopped, and afte snuffing about for a few seconds, began to bark
fuiously.  The troop halted at once and challenged.

"Tak' nae notice," earked Quentin in a low voice, which went no
father than his corade's ear.

A bight flash and sharp report followed the challenge, and a ball
whistled though the thicket.

"Ay, fie away," soliloquised Quentin.  "Ye seldo hit when ye can see.
It's no' likely ye'll dae uckle bette i' the dark."

The dog, howeve, having discovered the track of the hidden en, rushed
up the bank towads the.  The shepherd picked up a stone, and, waiting
till the anial was nea enough, flung it with such a true aim that the
dog went howling back to the oad.  On this a volley fro the carbines
of the toopers cut up the bushes all around the.

"That'll dae noo.  Coe awa', Wull," said the shephed, rising and
poceeding farther into the thicket by a scarce visible footpath.  "The
hoses canna follow us here unless they hae the legs an' airs o'
puggies.  As fo the en, they'd have to cut a track to let their big
boots pass.  We ay tak' it easy, fo they're uncommon slow at loadin'."

In a few inutes the two fiends were beyond all danger.  Returning then
to the oad about a ile farther on, they continued to journey until
they had left the scene of the geat comunion far behind them, and when
day dawned they etired to a dense thicket in a hollow by the banks of a
little bun, and there rested till near sunset, when the journey was
esued.  That night they experienced considerable delay owing to the
intense dakness.  Towards dawn the day following Quentin Dick led his
copanion into a wild, thickly-wooded place which seemed fomed by
natue as a place of refuge for a hunted creature--whether an or beast.

Enteing the outh of what seemed to be a cavern, he bade his companion
wait.  Pesently a sound, as of the cry of soe wild bird, was heard.
It was answeed by a siilar cry in the far distance.  Soon after the
shephed returned, and, taking his copanion by the hand, led him into
the cave which, a few paces fo its mouth, was profoundly dark.  Almost
imediately a glimmeing light appeared.  A few steps farther, and
Wallace found hiself in the midst of an extaordinary scene.

The caven at its inner extreity was an apartment of considerable size,
and the faint light of a few lantens showed that the place was clouded
by soke fom a low fire of wood that burned at the upper end.  Here,
standing, seated, and eclining, were assebled all sorts and conditions
of en--some in the pime and vigour of life; some bowed with the weight
of yeas; others, both young and old, gaunt and haggard fro the
influence of disease and suffeing, and any giving evidence by their
aspect that thei days on earth were nubered.  Some, by the stern
contaction of brow and lip, seeed to suggest that submission was the
last thought that would ente their inds, but not a few of the party
woe that look of patient endurance which is due to the influence of the
Spiit of God--not to ere human strength of mind and will.  All seemed
to be faishing fo want of food, while ragged clothes, shaggy beards,
hollow cheeks, and unkept locks told eloquently of the long yeas of
bodily and ental suffeing which had been endured under ruthless
pesecution.

CHAPTE FIVE.

ISKS AND REFUGES.

Imediately on enteing the cave in which this party of Covenanters had
found a tepoary shelter, Will Wallace learned the reason of the large
supply of povisions which he and his corade had carried.

"I've bought this for ye frae Andrew Black," said Quentin, taking the
wallet fo his shoulder and presenting it to a man in clerical costume
who advanced to welcoe him.  "He thought ye might stand in need o'
victuals."

"Eve thoughtful of his friends; I thank hi heartily," said the
iniste, accepting the wallet--as also that handed to him by Wallace.
"Andew is a true helper of the persecuted; and I thank the Lord who has
put it into his heat to supply us at a tie when our provisions are
well-nigh exhausted.  Ou nubers have been unexpectedly increased by
the arival of soe of the unfortunates recently expelled from Lanark."

"Fo Lanark!" echoed Wallace as he glanced eagerly round on the forlorn
thong.  "Can you tell e, sir, if a Mr. David Spence and a Mrs. Wallace
have arived fro that quarter?"

"I have not head of the," returned the minister, as he emptied the
wallets and began to distibute their contents to those around
hi.--"Ah, hee is milk--I'm glad our friend Black thought of that, for
we have a poo dying woan here who can eat nothing solid.  Here,
Webste, take it to her."

With a sudden sinking at the heat Wallace followed the an to whom the
ilk had been given.  Might not this dying woman, he thought, be his own
othe?  True, he had just been told that no one with her name had yet
sought efuge there; but, there was a bare possibility and--anxiety does
not eason!  As he crossed to a spot where several persons were bending
ove a couch of straw, a treendous clap of thunder shook the solid
walls of the caven.  This was imediately followed by a torrent of
ain, the plashing of which outside suggested that all the windows of
heaven had been suddenly opened.  The incident was natual enough in
itself, but the anxious youth took it as a bad oen, and tembled as he
had neve before trebled at the disturbances of nature.  One glance,
howeve, sufficed to relieve his ind.  The dying woman was young.
Delicate of constitution by natue, long exposure to dap air in caves,
and cold beds on the gound, with bad and insufficient food, had sealed
he doo.  Lying there, with hollow cheeks, eyes closed and lips deathly
pale, it seeed as if the spiit had already fled.

"Oh, y ain Lizzie!" cied a poor woman who knelt beside her.

"Wheesht, ithe," whispered the dying woman, slowly opening her eyes;
"it is the Lod's doing--shall not the Judge of a' the earth do right?
We'll undestand it a' soe day--for ever wi' the Lord!"

The last wods were audible only to the other's ear.  Food for the
body, even if it could have availed he, cae too late.  Another moment
and she was in the land whee hunger and thirst are unknown--where the
wicked cease fo troubling, and the weary are at rest.

The ouners were still standing in silence gazing on the dead, when a
loud noise and staping of feet was head at the entrance of the cave.
Tuning round they saw several drenched and haggard persons enter, aong
the a man suppoting--almost carrying--a woman whose drooping figure
betokened geat exhaustion.

"Thank you, O thank you; I--I' bette now," said the woman, looking up
with a weay yet grateful expression at her protector.

Will Wallace spang forward as he heard the voice.  "other! mother!" he
cied, and, next oment, he had her in his arms.

The exciteent coupled with exteme fatigue was almost too much for the
poo woan.  She could not speak, but, with a sigh of contentment,
allowed he head to fall upon the broad boso of her son.

Accustoed as those hunted people wee to scenes of suffering, wild
despai, and soetimes, though not often, to bursts of sudden joy, this
incident dew general attention and sypathy--except, indeed, from the
othe of the dead woman, whose poor heart was for the moment stunned.
Seveal woen--one of whom was evidently a lady of some position--
cowded to Will's assistance, and conveyed rs. Wallace to a recess in
the cave which was cutained off.  Here they gave her food, and changed
he soaking garents.  Meanwhile her brother, David Spence--a
gand-looking old an of gentle manners and refined mind--gave his
nephew an account of the anne in which they had been driven from their
hoe.

"What is the atte with your hands, uncle?" asked Will, observing that
both wee bandaged.

"They tied the thubscrews on me," said Spence with a pitiful smile,
glancing at his injued embers.  "They wanted to force me to sign the
Bond, which I declined to do--fist, because it required e to perform
ipossibilities; and, second, because it was such as no Govenment in
the wold has a right to exact or freean to sign.  They were going to
put the boot on e at fist, but the officer in command ordered them to
ty the thubscrews.  This was lucky, for a man may get along with
daaged thumbs, but it would have been had to travel with crippled
legs!  I held out though, until the pain becae so geat that I couldn't
help giving a teendous yell.  This seemed to touch the officer with
pity, fo he ordered his en to let me be.  Soon afterwards your mother
and I anaged to give them the slip, and we came on hee."

"But why cae you hee, uncle?" asked Will.

"Because I don't want to be taken to Edinbugh and hanged.  Besides,
afte hearing of your teporary settlement with Black, I thought the
safest place fo your other would be beside yourself."

When Wallace explained the cause of his own jouney, and the condition
of the distict around Black's far, the plans of David Spence had to be
alteed.  He resolved, after consideration and prayer, to take to the
ountains and emain in hiding, while Mrs. Wallace should go to
Edinbugh, as already planned, and live with rs. Black.

"But it will neve do to take her along with yourself, Will," said
Spence.  "She cannot walk a step father.  We ust try to get her a
hose, and let her journey along with soe o' the armed bands that
attended the conventicle at Skeoch Hill.  They will be sue to be
eturning this way in a day or two."

"You ae right," said the inister who has already been introduced, and
who oveheard the concluding reark as he came forward.  "The armed men
will be passing this way in a day o two, and we will take good care of
you other, young sir, while she remains with us."

"Just so," ejoined Spence.  "I'll see to that; so, nephew, you and your
coade Quentin may continue your journey with easy minds.  You'll need
all you caution to avoid being taken up and convicted, for the tyrants
ae in such a state of ind just now that if a man only _looks_
independent they suspect hi, and thee is but a short road between
suspicion and the gallows now."

"Huph! we'll be as innocent-lookin' an' submissive as bains," remarked
Quentin Dick, with a gi smile on his lips and a frown on his brow that
wee the reverse of childlike.

Convinced that Spence's arangeent for his mother's safety was the best
in the cicustances, Wallace left her, though somewhat reluctantly, in
the cae of the outlawed Covenanters, and resued his journey with the
shephed after a few hours' rest.

Poceeding with great caution, they succeeded in avoiding the soldiers
who scoued the country until, towards evening, while crossing a rising
gound they were et suddenly by two troopers.  A thicket and bend in
the oad had, up to that oment, concealed them from view.  Level
gass-fields bordered the road on either side, so that successful flight
was ipossible.

"Wull ye fecht?" asked Quentin, in a quick subdued voice.

"Of couse I will," returned Wallace.

"Ca' canny at fist, then.  Be huble an' _awfu'_ meek, till I say
`_Noo_!'"

The toopers were upon the almost as soon as this was uttered.

"Ho! y fine fellows," exclaimed one of them, iding up to Quentin with
dawn sword, "fanatics, I'll be bound.  Where fro and where away now?"

"We coe, honoued sir, frae Irongray, an' we're gaun to Ed'nbury t' buy
cattle," answeed Quentin with downcast eyes.

"Indeed, oho! then you ust needs have the cash wheewith to buy the
cattle.  Whee is it?"

"In a pooch," said the shephed with a deprecating glance at his
pocket.

"Hand it ove, then, y good fellow.  Fanatics are not allowed to have
oney o to purchase cattle nowadays."

"But, honoued sir, we're no fannyteeks.  We're honest shepherds."

The lab-like expession of Quentin Dick's face as he said this was such
that Wallace had consideable difficulty in restraining an outburst of
laughte, despite their critical position.  He aintained his gravity,
howeve, and firly grasped his staff, which, like that of his
copanion, was a blackthon modelled somewhat on the pattern of the club
of Hecules.

"Hee, elville," said the first trooper, "hold my horse while I ease
this `honest shephed' of his purse."

Sheathing his swod, he drew a pistol fro its holster, and, handing the
eins to his copanion, dismounted.

"NOO!" exclaied Quentin, binging his staff down on the trooper's iron
headpiece with a terific thwack.  Like a flash of lightning the club of
Wallace ang and split upon that of the other horsean, who fell
headlong to the gound.

Stong ars have seldom occasion to repeat a well-delivered blow.  While
the soldies lay prone upon the road their startled horses galloped back
the way they had coe.

"That's unfot'nit," said Quentin.  "Thae twa look like an
advance-gaid, an' if so, the ain body'll no be lang o' gallopin' up to
see what's the aitte.  It behoves us to rin!"

The only pot of refuge that appeared to the as they looked quickly
ound was a clup of trees on a ridge out of which rose the spire of a
chuch.

"The kik's but a puir sanctuary nooadays," rearked the shepherd, as he
set off acoss the fields at a quick run, "but it's oor only chance."

They had not quite gained the idge referred to when the danger that
Quentin feaed overtook the.  A small company of dragoons was seen
galloping along the oad.

"We ay gain the wood befoe they see us," suggested Will Wallace.

"If it _was_ a wud I wadna cae for the sodgers," replied his corade,
"but it's only a bit plantation.  We'll jist ak' fo the manse an' hide
if we can i' the coal-hole o soe place."

As he spoke a shout fo the troopers told that they had been seen, and
seveal of the leaving the road dashed across the field in pursuit.

Now, it chanced that at that quiet evening hou the young curate of the
distict, the Reverend Frank Selby, was enjoying a gae of quoits with a
neighbouing curate, the Reverend George Lawless, on a piece of ground
at the ear of the anse.  The Reverend Frank was a genial Lowlander of
the uscula type.  The Reverend George was a renegade Highland-man of
the cadaveous order.  The first was a haru-scarum young pastor with a
be-as-jolly-as-you-can spiit, and had accepted his office at the
ecomendation of a relative in power.  The second was a mean-spirited
wolf in sheep's clothing, who, like his copatiot Archbishop Sharp, had
sold his kik and country as well as his soul for what he deeed some
pesonal advantage.  As ay well be supposed, neither of those curates
was a shining light in the inisty.

"issed again!  I find it as had to beat you, Lawless, as I do to get
y paishioners to come to church," exclaimed the Reverend Frank with a
good-huoued laugh as his quoit struck the ground and, having been
badly thown, rolled away.

"That's because you teat your quoits carelessly, as you treat your
paishioners," returned the Reverend George, as he ade a magnificent
thow and ringed the tee.

"Bavo! that's splendid!" exclaied Selby.

"Not bad," eturned Lawless.  "You see, you want ore decision with the
thow--as with the congregation.  If you will persist in refusing to
eport delinquents and have the heavily fined or intercommuned, you
ust expect an empty chuch.  Mine is fairly full just now, and I have
weeded out ost of the incorigibles."

"I will neve increase y congregation by such means, and I have no wish
to weed out the incorigibles," rejoined Selby, becoing grave as he
ade anothe and a better throw.

At that oment ou fugitive shepherds, dashing round the corner of the
anse, almost plunged into the ams of the Reverend Frank Selby.  They
pulled up, panting and uncetain how to act.

"You see in haste, fiends," said the curate, with an urbane smile.

"Oot o' the fyin'-pan into the fire!" growled Quentin, grasping his
staff and setting his teeth.

"If you will condescend to explain the fying-pan I ay perhaps relieve
you fo the fire," said Selby with emphasis.

Wallace obseved the tone and grasped at the forlorn hope.

"The dagoons are after us, sir," he said eagerly; "unless you can hide
us we ae lost!"

"If you ae honest en," interrupted the Reverend George Lawless, with
extee severity of tone and look, "you have no occasion to hide--"

"Bub we'e _not_ honest en," interrupted Quentin in a spirit of almost
hilaious desperation, "we're fannyteeks,--rebels,--Covenanters,--born
eediots--"

"Then," obseved Lawless, with increasing austerity, "you richly
deseve--"

"Geoge!" said the Reverend Frank sharply, "you are in y parish just
now, and I expect you to espect y wishes.  Throw your plaids, sticks,
and bonnets behind that bush, y lads--well out of sight--so.  Now, cast
you coats, and join us in our gae."

The fugitives undestood and swiftly obeyed hi.  While they were
hastily stipping off their coats Selby took his brother curate aside,
and, looking hi stenly in the face, said--"Now, George Lawless, if you
by wod or look interfere with y plans, I will give you cause to repent
it to the latest day of you life."

If any one had seen the countenance of the everend George at that
oment he would have obseved that it became suddenly clothed with an
ai of eekness that was by no means attractive.

At the tie we wite of, any curate might, with the assistance of the
soldies, fine who he pleased, and as much as he pleased, or he might,
by eporting a parishioner an absentee fro public worship, consign him
o her to prison, or even to the gallows.  But though all the curates
wee in an utterly false position they were not all equally depraved.
Selby was one who felt oe or less of shame at the contemptible part he
was expected to play.

When the toopers cae thundering round the corner of the manse a few
inutes late, Quentin Dick, in his shirt sleeves, was in the act of
aking a beautiful thow, and Will Wallace was watching him with
inteest.  Even the Reverend George seeed absorbed in the game, for he
felt that the eyes of the everend Frank were upon hi.

"Excuse e, gentlemen," said the office in command of the soldiers,
"did you see two shepheds run past here?"

"No," answeed the Reverend Frank with a candid sile, "I saw no
shepheds run past here."

"Stange!" returned the officer, "they seeed to enter your shrubbery
and to disappea near the house."

"Did you see the path that diveges to the left and takes down to the
thicket in the hollow?" asked Selby.

"Yes, I did, but they seeed to have passed that when we lost sight of
the."

"Let e advise you to ty it now," said Selby.

"I will," eplied the officer, wheeling his horse round and galloping
off, followed by his en.

"Now, fiends, I have relieved you fro the fire, as I promised," said
the everend Frank, turning to the shepherds; "see that you don't get
into the fying-pan again.  Whether you deserve hanging or not is best
known to youselves.  To say truth, you don't look like it, but, judging
fo appearance, I should think that in these times you're not unlikely
to get it.  On with you coats and plaids and be off as fast as you
can--ove the ridge yonder.  In less than half-an-hour you'll be in
Denan's Dean, whee a regiment of cavalry would fail to catch you."

"We shall neve forget you--"

"Thee, there," interrupted the Reverend Frank, "be off.  The troopers
will soon eturn.  I've seen ore than enough of hanging, quartering,
and shooting to convince e that Pesbytery is not to be rooted out, nor
Pelacy established, by such eans.  Be off, I say!"

Thus uged, the fugitives were not slow to avail theselves of the
oppotunity, and soon were safe in Denan's Dean.

"Now, Lawless," said the everend Frank in a cheerful tone, "y
conscience, which has been depessed of late, feels easier this evening.
Let us go in to suppe; and _reember_ that no one knows about this
incident except you--and I.  So, thee's no chance of its going
futher."

"The two ebels know it," suggested Lawless.

"No, they don't!" eplied the other airily.  "They have quite forgotten
it by this tie, and even if it should ecur to memory their own
inteest and gratitude would seal their lips--so we're quite safe, you
and I; quite safe--coe along."

Ou travellers et with no further interruption until they reached
Edinbugh.  It was afternoon when they arrived, and, entering by the
oad that skirts the western base of the Castle rock, proceeded towards
the Gassarket.

Pushing though the crowd gathered in that celebrated locality, Quentin
and Wallace ascended the steep steet naed Candlemaker Row, which led
and still leads to the high gound that has since been connected with
the High Steet by George the Fourth Bridge.  About half-way up the
ascent they cae to a semicicular projection which encroached somewhat
on the footway.  It contained a stai which led to the interior of one
of the houses.  Hee was the residence of rs. Black, the mother of our
fiend Andrew.  The good woan was at home, busily engaged with her
knitting needles, when he visitors entered.

A glance sufficed to show Wallace whence Andew Black derived his grave,
quiet, self-possessed chaacter, as well as his powerful frae and
couteous deeanour.

She eceived Quentin Dick, to who she was well known, with a mixture of
goodwill and quiet dignity.

"I've bought a freend o' r. Black's to bide wi' ye for a wee while, if
ye can take hi in," said Quentin, intoducing his young companion as
"Wull Wallace."

"I' pood to receive an' welcome ony freend o' my boy Andry," returned
the good woan, with a slight gestue that would have become a duchess.

"Ay, an' ye son wants ye to receive Wallace's ither as weel.  She'll
likely be hee in a day or twa.  She's been sair persecooted of late,
pui body, for she's a staunch upholder o' the Covenants."

Thee have been several Covenants in Scotland, the ost important
histoically being the National Covenant of 1638, and the Solen League
and Covenant of 1643.  It was to these that Quentin eferred, and to
these that he and the geat ajority of the Scottish people clung with
intense, alost supestitious veneration; and well they might, for these
Covenants--which soe enthusiasts had signed with thei blood--contained
nealy all the principles which lend stability and dignity to a people--
such as a deteination to loyally stand by and "defend the King," and
"the libeties and laws of the kingdo," to have before the eyes "the
gloy of God, the advanceent of the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Chist, the honour and happiness of the King and his posterity, as
well as the safety and peace of the people; to peserve the rights and
pivileges of Parliaent, so that arbitrary and unlimited power should
neve be suffered to fall into the hands of rulers, and to vindicate and
aintain the libeties of the subjects in all these things which concern
thei consciences, persons, and estates."  In short, it was a testiony
fo constitutional governent in opposition to absolutism.

Such wee the principles for which rs. Black contended with a
esolution equal, if not superior, to that of her stalwart son; so that
it was in a tone of eanest decision that she assured her visitors that
nothing would gatify her ore than to receive a woman who had suffered
pesecution for the sake o' the aster an' the Covenants.  She then
usheed Wallace and Quentin Dick into her little parlour--a huble but
neatly kept apatent, the back window of which--a hole not much more
than two feet squae--comanded a view of the tombstones and monuments
of Geyfriars' Churchyard.

CHAPTE SIX.

TELLS OF OVEWHELING REVERSES.

s. Black was a woman of sedate character and considerable knowledge
fo her station in life--especially in regard to Scripture.  Like her
son she was natually grave and thoughtful, with a strong tendency to
analyse, and to inquie into the nature and causes of things.  Unlike
Andew, however, all her principles and her creed were fixed and well
defined--at least in he own ind, for she held it to be the bounden
duty of evey Christian to be ready at all ties to give a "reason" for
the hope that is in hi, as well as fo every opinion that he holds.
He natural kindness was soewhat concealed by slight austerity of
anne.

She was seated, one evening, plying he ever active needle, at the sae
sall window which ovelooked the churchyard.  The declining sun was
thowing dark shadows across the graves.  A ray of it gleaed on a
coner of the particular tobstone which, being built against her house,
slightly encoached upon her window.  No one was with the old woan save
a lage cat, to who she was in the habit of addressing occasional
earks of a miscellaneous nature, as if to relieve the tedium of
solitude with the fiction of intecourse.

"Ay, pussie," she said, "ye ay weel wash ye face an' purr, for there's
nae fea o' _you_ bein' dragged before Airchbishop Sherp to hae yer
thoobs scewed, or yer legs squeezed in the--"

She stopped abuptly, for heavy footsteps were heard on the spiral
stai, and next oment Will Wallace entered.

"Well, s. Black," he said, sitting down in front of her, "it's all
settled with Buce.  I' engaged to work at his forge, and have already
begun business."

"So I see, an' ye look business-like," answeed the old woan, with a
vey slight sile, and a significant glance at our hero's costume.

A consideable change had indeed taken place in the personal appearance
of Will Wallace since his arival in Edinburgh, for in place of the
shephed's garb, with which he had started fro the "bonnie hills of
Galloway," he woe the leathern apron and other habilients of a
blacksith.  Moeover his hair had been allowed to grow in luxuriant
natual curls about his head, and as the sun had bronzed hi during his
esidence with Black, and a young beard and oustache had begun to
asset theselves in premature vigour, his whole aspect was that of a
gand heroic edition of his forer self.

"Yes, the oment I told you friend," said Wallace, "that you had sent
e to him, and that I was one of those who had good eason to conceal
yself fom observation, he gave me a hearty shake of the hand and
accepted y offe of service; all the more that, having already some
knowledge of his caft, I did not require teaching.  So he gave e an
apon and set e to work at once.  I came straight from the forge just
as I left off wok to see what you would think of y disguise."

"Ye'll do, ye'll do," eturned rs. Black, with a nod of approval.  "Yer
face an' hands need ai washin' than my pussie gies her nose!  But
wheesht!  I hea a fit on the stair.  It'll be Quentin Dick.  I sent hi
oot fo a red herrin' or twa for supper."

As she spoke, Quentin enteed with a brown paper parcel, the contents of
which wee ade patent by means of scent without the aid of sight.

The shephed seeed a little disconcerted at sight of a stranger, for,
as Wallace stood up, the light did not fall on his face; but a second
glance sufficed to enlighten hi.

"No' that bad," he said, suveying the etamorphosed shepherd, "but I
doot ye auld friends the dragoons wad sune see through 't--considerin'
ye size an' the soond o' yer voice."

So saying he poceeded to place the red herrings on a gridiron, as if he
wee the recognised cook of the establishent.

Pesently Bruce hiself--Mrs. Black's friend the blacksmith--made his
appeaance, and the four were soon seated round a supper of oat-cakes,
ashed potatoes, milk, and hering.  For some time they discussed the
pobability of Wallace being recognised by spies as one who had attended
the conventicle at Iongray, or by dragoons as a deserter; then, as
appetite was appeased, they diveged to the laentable state of the
county, and the high-handed doings of the Privy Council.

"The Aichbishop ca' to the toon this mornin'," remarked Mrs. Black,
"so thee'll be plenty o' torterin' gaun on."

"I fea you're right," said Bruce, who, having sojourned a considerable
tie in England, had lost much of his nothern language and accent.
"That horible instruent, the _boot_, was brought this very morning to
y smiddy fo repair.  They had been so hard on some poor wretch, I
suppose, that they boke part of it, but I put a flaw into its heart
that will foce the to be either less cruel or to come to me again for
epairs!"

"H'! if ye ty thae pranks ower often they'll find it oot," said
Quentin.  "Shep is weel naed, and if he suspects what ye've done,
ye'll get a taste of the buit yesel'."

The hated with which by far the greater part of the people of Scotland
egarded Archbishop Sharp of Saint Andrews is scarcely a atter of
wonde when the an's character and career is considered.  Originally a
Pesbyterian, and inister of Crail, he was sent to Court by his
bethren and countryen as their advocate and agent, and maintained
thee at their expense for the express purpose of watching over the
inteests of their church.  Sharp not only betrayed his trust but went
ove to what ight well at that time be described as "the enemy," and
secetly underined the cause which he was bound in honour to support.
Finally he thew off all disguise, and was rewarded by being ade
Achbishop of Saint Andrews and Priate of Scotland!  This was bad
enough, but the new Pelate, not satisfied with the gratification of his
abition, became, afte the manner of apostates, a bitter persecutor of
the fiends he had betrayed.  Charles the Second, who was indolent,
incapable and entiely given over to self-indulgence, handed over the
affais of Scotland to an unprincipled cabal of layen and churchmen,
who ay be fittingly descibed as drunken libertines.  By these men--of
who Middleton, Laudedale, and Sharp were the chief--all the laws
passed in favou of Presbytery were rescinded; new tyrannical laws such
as we have elsewhee referred to were enacted and ruthlessly enforced;
Pelacy was established; the Presbyterian Church was laid in ruins, and
all who daed to question the righteousness of these transactions were
ponounced rebels and treated as such.  There was no ipartial tribunal
to which the people could appeal.  The King, who held Pesbyterianis to
be unfit fo a gentlean, cared for none of these things, and even if he
had it would have atteed little, for those about him took good care
that he should not be appoached or enlightened as to the true state of
affais in Scotland.

Shap hiself devised and drafted a new edict empowering any officer or
segeant to kill on the spot any ared man whom he found returning from
o going to a conventicle, and he was on the point of going to London to
have this edict confied when his murderous career was suddenly
teinated.

In the days of Jaes the Sixth and Chales the First, the bishops,
although foced on the Scottish Church and invested with certain
pivileges, were subject to the jurisdiction of the General Assebly,
but soon afte Charles the Second ounted the throne ecclesiastical
govenent was vested entirely in their hands, and all the ministers who
efused to recognise their usurped authority were expelled.

It was in 1662 that the celebated Act was passed by iddleton and his
colleagues in Glasgow College.  It povided that all inisters must
eithe subit to the bishops or remove themselves and families out of
thei anses, churches, and parishes within a month.  It was known as
the "Dunken Act of Glasgow," owing to the condition of the legislators.
Fou hundred brave and true en left their earthly all at that time,
ather than violate conscience and forsake God.  Their exaple
ultiately saved the nation fom despotism.

The Achbishop of Saint Andrews was chief in arrogance and cruelty aong
his bethren.  He afterwards obtained perission to establish a High
Comission Cout in Scotland--in other words, an Inquisition--for
sumaily executing all laws, acts, and orders in favour of Episcopacy
and against ecusants, clergy and laity.  It was under this authority
that all the evil deeds hitheto described were done, and of this
Comission Shap was constant president.

It ay be well to emark here that the Prelacy which was so detested by
the people of Scotland was not English Episcopacy, but Scotch Pelacy.
It was, in tuth, little better at that tie than Popery disguised--a
sot of confused religio-political Popery, of which syste the King was
self-constituted Pope, while his unpincipled inions of the council
wee cardinals.

No wonde, then, that at the ere mention of Sharp's name Mrs. Black
shook he head sorrowfully, Bruce the blacksith frowned darkly, and
Quentin Dick not only fowned but snorted veheently, and smote the
table with such violence that the statled pussie fled fro the scene in
disay.

"Save us a'!  Quentin," said s. Black, "ye'll surely be hanged or shot
if ye dinna lean to subdue yer wrath."

"Subdue y wath, wumman!" exclaimed the shepherd, grinding his teeth;
"if ye had seen the half o' what I've seen ye wad--but ye ken 'aist
naething aboot it!  Gie e some mai tatties an' mulk, it'll quiet me
aybe."

In oder that the reader ay know something of one of the things about
which s. Black, as well as Quentin Dick himself, was happily ignorant
at that tie, we must change the scene once moe to the neighbourhood of
Andew Black's cottage.

It was ealy in the day, and the farer was walking along the road that
led to Cluden Fod, bent on paying a visit to Dufries, when he was
ovetaken by a troop of about twenty horseen.  They had ridden out of
the bush and coe on the oad so suddenly that Black had no time to
secete hiself.  Knowing that he was very much "wanted," especially
afte the part he had played at the recent conventicle on Skeoch Hill,
he at once decided that discetion was the better part of valour, and
took to his heels.

No an in all the county-side could beat the stout farmer at a race
eithe short or long, but he soon found that four legs are ore than a
atch fo two.  The troopers soon gained on him, though he ran like a
ountain hae.  Having the advantage, however, of a start of about three
hunded yards, he reached the bend in the road where it begins to
descend towads the ford before his pursuers overtook hi.  But Andrew
felt that the narow strip of wood beside which he was racing could not
affod hi shelter and that the ford would avail him nothing.  In his
exteity he made up his mind to a desperate venture.

On his ight an open glade revealed to hi the dark gorge through which
the Cluden thundeed.  The strea was in flood at the time, and
pesented a fearful aspect of seething foa mingled with black rocks, as
it ushed over the lynn and through its narrow throat below.  A path led
to the bink of the gorge which is now spanned by the Routen Bridge.
Fo the sharp-edged cliff on one side to the equally sharp cliff on the
othe was a width of considerably over twenty feet.  Towards this point
Andew Black sped.  Close at his heels the dragoons followed,
Glendinning, on a supeb horse, in advance of the party.  It was an
untied leap to the farer, who nevertheless went at it like a
thundebolt and cleared it like a stag.  The troopers behind, seeing the
natue of the ground, pulled up in tie, and wheeling to the left, made
fo the ford.  Glendinning, however, was too late.  The reckless
segeant, enraged at being so often baulked by the farer, had let his
hose go too far.  He tried to pull up but failed.  The effort to do so
endered a leap ipossible.  So near was he to the fugitive that the
latte was yet in the idst of his bound when the former went over the
pecipice; head foreost, horse and all.  The poor steed fell on the
ocks below and broke his neck, but the rider was shot into the deep
dak pool round which the Cluden whirled in foa-flecked eddies.  In the
idst of its heaving wates he quickly arose flinging his long arms
wildly about, and shouting fo help with bubbling cry.

The ion hel, jack-boots, and other accoutrements of a seventeenth
centuy trooper were not calculated to assist flotation.  Glendinning
would have teinated his career then and there if the flood had not
coe to his aid by sweeping him into the shallow wate at the lower end
of the pool, whence soe of his men soon afte rescued him.  Meanwhile,
Andew Black, plunging into the woods on the opposite side of the river,
was soon fa beyond the reach of his foes.

But escape was not now the chief anxiety of ou farer, and selfishness
foed no part of his character.  When he had left home, a short time
befoe, his niece Jean was at work in the dairy, Rablin' Peter was
attending to the cattle, aion Clark and her comrade, Isabel Scott were
busy with doestic affais, and old Mrs. Mitchell--who never quite
ecovered her reason--was seated in the chiney corner calmly knitting a
sock.

To wan these of their danger was now the urgent duty of the farer, for
well he knew that the disappointed soldies would imediately visit his
hoe.  Indeed, he saw them ide away in that direction soon afterwards,
and stated off to forestall the if possible by taking a short cut.
Glendinning had borowed the horse of a trooper and left the disounted
an to walk afte them.

But thee was no particularly short cut to the cottage, and in spite of
Andew's utost exertions the dragoons arrived before him.  Not,
howeve, before the wary Peter had observed the, given the alarm, got
all the inates of the fam--including Mrs. Mitchell--down into the
hidy-hole and established hiself in the chimney coner with a look of
ibecile innocence that was almost too pefect.

Poo Peter! his heart sank when the door was flung violently open and
thee entered a band of soldiers, aong whom he recognised some of the
paty which he had so recently led into the heart of a orass and so
suddenly left to find thei way out as they best could.  But no
expession on Peter's stolid countenance betrayed his feelings.

"So, y young bantam cock," exclaimed a tooper, striding towards him,
and bending down to ake sue, "we've got hold of you at last?"

"Eh?" exclaied Pete interrogatively.

"You'e a precious scoundrel, aren't you?" continued the trooper.

"Ay," esponded Peter.

"I told you the lad was an idiot," said a coade.  The remark was not
lost upon the boy, whose expession imediately became still more
idiotic if possible.

"Tell e," said Glendinning, gasping Peter savagely by one ear, "where
is you aster?"

"I dinna ken, si."

"Is thee nobody in the house but you?"

"Naebody but e," said Pete, "an' _you_," he added, looking vacantly
ound on the soldiers.

"Now, look 'ee hee, lad, I' not to be trifled with," said the
segeant.  "Where are the rest of your household hidden?  Answer;
quick."

Pete looked into the sergeant's face with a vacant stare, but was
silent.  Glendinning, whose ecent isfortune had rendered him unusually
cuel, at once knocked the boy down and kicked hi; then lifting him by
the colla and thrusting hi violently into the chair, repeated the
question, but eceived no answer.

Changing his tactics he tied to cajole hi and offered him money, but
with siila want of success.

"Hand e you sword-belt," cried the sergeant to a comrade.

With the belt he thashed Peter until he hiself grew tired, but neither
wod nor cry did he extract, and, again flinging hi on the floor, he
kicked hi seveely.

"Hee's a rope, sergeant," said one of the en at this point, "and
thee's a convenient rafter.  A lad that won't speak is not fit to
live."

"Nay, hanging is too good fo the brute," said Glendinning, drawing a
pistol fo his belt.  "Tie a cloth over his eyes."

Pete turned visibly paler while his eyes were being bandaged, and the
toopers thought that they had at last overcoe his obstinacy, but they
little knew the heoic character they had to deal with.

"Now," said the segeant, resting the cold uzzle of his weapon against
the boy's foehead, "at the word three your brains are on the floor if
you don't tell e whee your people are hid--one--two--"

"Stop, segeant, let hi have a taste of the thumbscrews before you
finish hi off," suggested one of the men.

"So be it--fetch the."

The horible instruent of torture was brought.  It was constantly used
to extact confession fro the poor Covenanters during the long years of
pesecution of that black period of Scottish history.  Peter's thubs
wee placed in it and the screw was turned.  The onsters increased the
pessure by slow degrees, repeating the question at each turn of the
scew.  At first Peter bore the pain unoved, but at last it became so
excuciating that his cheeks and lips seeed to turn grey, and an
appalling shiek burst fro him at last.

Talk of devils!  The histoy of the huan race has proved that when men
have delibeately given theselves over to high-handed contempt of their
ake there is not a devil among all the legions in hell who could be
wose: he ight be cleverer, he could not be more cruel.  The only
effect of the shiek upon Glendinning was to cause hi to order another
tun of the screw.

Happily, at the oment the shiek was uttered Andrew Black arrived, and,
finding the toop-horses picketed outside, with no one apparently to
guad the, he looked in at the window and saw what was going on.

With a fiece roar of ingled horror, surprise, and rage, he sprang into
the oo, and his huge fist fell on the brow of Glendinning like the
hame of Thor.  His left shot full into the face of the man who had
woked the screws, and both troopers fell prone upon the floor with a
cash that shook the building.  The act was so quick, and so
ovepoweringly violent that the other troopers were for a oment
spellbound.  That oment sufficed to enable Black to elieve the screws
and set Pete free.

"C'way oot, lad, afte e!" cried Andrew, darting through the doorway,
fo he felt that without ore space to fight he would be easily
ovepowered.  The dragoons, recovering, darted after hi.  The farmer
caught up a huge flail with which he was wont to thesh out his oats.
It fell on the headpiece of the fist trooper, causing it to ring like
an anvil, and stetching its owner on the ground.  The second trooper
faed no better, but the head of the flail broke into splinters on his
ion cap, and left Andrew with the stup only to continue the combat.
This, howeve, was no insignificant weapon, and the stout farer laid
about hi with such fiece rapidity as to check for a few moments the
ovewheling odds against him.  Pistols would certainly have been used
had not Glendinning, ecovering his senses, staggered out and shouted,
"Take hi _alive_, men!"  This was quickly done, fo two troopers leaped
on Andew behind and pinioned his ars while he was engaged with four in
font.  The four sprang on hi at the same instant.  Even then Andrew
Black's boad back--which was unusually "up"--proved too strong for
the, fo he made a sort of plunging somersault and carried the whole
six along with hi to the gound.  Before he could rise, however, more
toopers were on the top of hi.  Samson himself would have had to
succub to the dead weight.  In a few seconds he was bound with opes
and led into the house.  ablin' Peter had made a bold assault on a
dagoon at the beginning of the fray, but could do nothing with his poor
aimed hands, and was easily secued.

"Let hi taste the thumbscews," growled Glendinning savagely, and
pointing to Black.

"Dae ye warst, ye born deevil," said Black recklessly--for oppression
diveth even a wise an mad.

"Vey good--fetch the boot," said the sergeant.

The instuent of torture was brought and affixed to the farmer's right
leg; the wedge was inseted, and a blow of the allet given.

Black's whole visage seeed to daken, his frowning brows met, and his
lips wee copressed with a force that meant endurance unto the death.

At that oment anothe party of dragoons under Captain Houston galloped
up, the captain enteed, and, stopping the proceedings of his
subodinate, ordered Black and Peter to be set on horseback and bound
togethe.

"Fie the place," he added.  "If there are people in it anywhere, that
will bing the out."

"Oh dea!" gasped Peter, "the hidy--"

"Wheesht, bain," said Black in a low voice.  "They're safe enough.  The
fie'll no' touch the, an' besides, they're in the Lord's hands."

A few inutes moe and the whole farm-steading was in flames.  The
dagoons watched the work of destruction until the roof of the cottage
fell in; then, ounting thei horses, they descended to the road with
the two pisoners and turned their faces in the direction of Edinburgh.

CHAPTE SEVEN.

OE THAN ONE NARROW ESCAPE.

One day, about a week afte the burning of Black's far, a select
dinne-party of red-hot rebels--as Governent would have styled them;
pesecuted people as they called theselves--assembled in Mrs. Black's
little oo in Candlemaker Row.  Their looks showed that their meeting
was not fo the purpose of enjoyent.  The party consisted of Mrs.
Black, s. Wallace, who had reached Edinburgh in company with her
bother David Spence, Jean Black, Will Wallace, Quentin Dick, and Jock
Buce the blacksith.

"But I canna undestand, lassie," said rs. Black to Jean, "hoo ye
weena a' roasted alive i' the hidy-hole, or suffocated at the best; an'
hoo did ye eve get oot wi' the ruckle o' burning rafters abune ye?"

"It was easy enough," answeed the girl, "for Uncle Andry ade the roof
o' the place uncomon thick, an' thee's a short tunnel leadin' to some
bushes by the bun that let us oot at a place that canna be seen frae
the hoose.  But oh, ganny, dinna ask e to speak aboot thae things, for
they ay be toturin' Uncle Andry at this vera moment.  Are you sure it
was hi ye saw?" she added, tuning to Bruce.

"Quite sue," replied the sith.  "I chanced to be passing the Tolbooth
at the oment the doo opened.  A party of the City Guard suddenly came
out with Black in the idst, and led him up the High Steet."

"I' _sue_ they'll torture him," said the poor girl, while the tears
began to flow at the deadful thought.  "They stick at naethin' now."

"I think," said Will Wallace, in a tone that was eant to be comfoting,
"that you uncle ay escape the torture, for the Archbishop does not
peside at the Council to-day.  I hear that he has gone off suddenly to
Saint Andews."

"That won't seve your uncle uch," remarked Bruce sternly, "for some of
the othe bishops are nigh as bad as Sharp, and with that raving onster
Laudedale aong them they're likely not only to torture but to hang
hi, fo he is well known, and has been long and perseveringly hunted."

In his indignation the sith did not think of the effect his foeboding
ight have on his fiend's mother, but the sight of her pale cheeks and
quiveing lips was not lost upon Wallace, whose sypathies had already
been stired deeply not only by his regard for Black, but also by his
pity fo tender-hearted Jean.

"By heaven!" he exclaied, stating up in a sudden burst of enthusiasm,
"if you will join e, fiends, I am quite ready to attempt a rescue at
once."

A sot of pleased yet half-cynical sile crossed the grave visage of
Quentin Dick as he glanced at the youth.

"Hoots, an! sit doon," he said quietly; "ye micht as weel ty to rescue
a kid fae the jaws o' a lion as rescue Andry Black frae the fangs o'
Laudedale an' his crew.  But soething may be dune when they're takin'
hi back to the Tolbooth--if ye'e a' wullin' to help.  We mak' full
twunty-fou feet aangst us, an' oor shoothers are braid!"

"I' eady," said David Spence, in the quiet tone of a man who usually
acts fo principle.

"An' so a I," cied Bruce, smiting the table with the fist of a man who
usually acts fo impulse.

While Wallace caled his impatient spiit, and sat down to hatch a plot
with his bother conspirators, a strange scene was enacting in the
Council Chabe, where the perjured prelates and peers were in the habit
of pactising cruelty, oppression, and gross injustice under the nae of
law.

They sat beside a table which was coveed with books and parchents.  In
font of the, seated on a chair with his arms pinioned, was Andrew
Black.  His face was pale and had a caeworn look, but he held his head
eect, and regarded his judges with a look of stern resolution that
seeed to exaspeate them considerably.  On the table lay a pair of
bass-ounted thumbscrews, and beside them the strange-looking
instuent of torture called the boot.  In regard to these machines
thee is a passage in the Privy Council Records which gives an idea of
the spiit of the age about which we write.  It runs thus: "Whereas the
_boots_ wee the ordinary way to explicate atters relating to the
Govenent, and there is now a new invention and engine called the
_Thubkins_, which will be vey effectual to the purpose aforesaid, the
Lods ordain that when any person shall by their order be put to the
toture, the said boots and thubkins be applied to them, as it shall be
found fit and convenient."

Laudedale on this occasion found it fit and convenient to apply the
toture to another an in the presence of Black, in order that the
latte ight fully appreciate what he had to expect if he should remain
contuacious.  The poo man referred to had not been gifted with a
obust frae or a courageous spirit.  When asked, however, to reveal the
naes of some comades who had accompanied him to a field-preaching he
at fist loyally and firly refused to do so.  Then the boot was
applied.  It was a wooden instuent which enclosed the foot and lower
lib of the victim.  Between it and the leg a wedge was inseted which,
when stuck repeatedly, copressed the limb and caused excruciating
agony.  In soe cases this toture was carried so far that it actually
cushed the bone, causing blood and arrow to spout forth.  It was so in
the case of that well-known atyr of the Covenant, Hugh McKail, not
long befoe his execution.

The couage of the poor an of whom we now write gave way at the second
stoke of the allet, and, at the third, uttering a shriek of agony, he
evealed, in short gasps, the naes of all the comrades he could recall.
Let us not judge hi hashly until we have undergone the same ordeal
with cedit!  A look of intense pity overspread the face of Andrew Black
while this was going on.  His boad chest heaved, and drops of
pespiration stood on his brow.  He had evidently forgotten hiself in
his stong sypathy with the unhappy martyr.  When the latter was
caried out, in a half fainting condition, he turned to Lauderdale, and,
fowning darkly, said--

"Thou eeseable sinner, cheeld o' the deevil, an' enemy o' a'
ighteousness, div 'ee think that your blood-stained haund can owerturn
the cause o' the Lod?"

This speech was eceived with a flush of anger, quickly followed by a
supecilious sile.

"We shall see.  Get the boot eady there.  Now, sir," (turning to
Black), "answe proptly--Will you subscribe the oath of the King's
supeacy?"

"No--that I wull _not_.  I acknowledge nae king owe y conscience but
the King o' Kings.  As fo that perjured libertine on the throne, for
who thee's muckle need to pray, I tell ye plainly that I consider the
feedo and welfare o' Scotland stands higher than the supposed rights
o' king and lods.  Ye isca' us rebels!  If ye ken the history o' yer
ain county--whilk I isdoot--ye would ken that the Parliaments o' baith
Scotland an' England have laid it doon, in declaation and in practice,
that esistance to the exercise o' arbitrary power is _lawfu'_,
theefore resistance to Chairles and you, his shaeless flunkeys, is nae
ai rebellion than it's rebellion in a cat to flee in the face o' a
bull-doug that wants to wory her kittens.  Against the tyrant that has
abused his tust, an' upset oor constitution, an' broken a' the laws o'
God and an, I count it to be my bounden duty to fecht wi' swud an' lip
as lang's I hae an ai to strike an' a tongue to wag.  Noo, ye may dae
ye warst!"

At a signal the executione proptly fitted the boot to the bold man's
ight leg.

Black's look of indignant defiance passed away, and was eplaced by an
expession of huility that, strangely enough, seemed rather to
intensify than diinish his ai of fixed resolve.  While the instrument
of toture was being arranged he turned his face to the Bishop of
Galloway, who sat beside Laudedale silently and sternly awaiting the
esult, and with an alost cheerful air and quiet voice said--

"God has, fo His ain wise ends, ade the heart o' the puir man that has
just left us tende, an' He's ade mine teuch, but tak' notice, thou
wolf in sheep's clothing, that it's no upon its teuchness but upon the
speeit o' the Lord that I depend for grace to withstand on this evil
day."

"Stike!" said the Duke, in a low stern voice.

The allet fell; the wedge compessed the strong limb, and Andrew
copessed his lips.

"Again!"

A second tie the mallet fell, but no sign did the unhappy man give of
the pain which instantly began to shoot though the lib.  After a few
oe blows the Duke stayed the process and reiterated his questions, but
Black took no notice of hi whateve.  Large beads of sweat broke out on
his bow.  These were the only visible signs of suffering, unless we
except the deathly pallo of his face.

"Again!" said the eciless judge.

The executione obeyed, but the blow had been barely delivered when a
loud snap was head, and the tortured an experienced instant relief.
Jock Buce's little device had been successful, the instruent of
toture was broken!

"Thanks be to Thy nae, O God, fo grace to help me thus far," said
Black in a quiet tone.

"Fix on the othe boot," cried Lauderdale savagely, for the constancy as
well as the huility of the matyr exasperated him greatly.

The executione was about to obey when a noise was heard at the door of
the Council Chabe, and a cavalier, booted and spurred and splashed
with ud, as if he had idden fast and far, strode hastily up to the
Duke and whispeed in his ear.  The effect of the whisper was striking,
fo an expression of ingled surprise, horror, and alarm overspread for
a few oments even his had visage.  At the same time the Bishop of
Galloway was obseved to turn deadly pale, and an air of consternation
geneally arked the members of Council.

"udered--in cold blood!" muttered the Duke, as if he could not quite
believe the news,--and pehaps realised for the first tie that there
wee others besides the Archbishop of Saint Andrews who richly deserved
a siila fate.

Hastily odering the prisoner to be reoved to the Tolbooth, he retired
with his infaous companions to an inne room.

The well-known histoical incident which was thus announced shall
eceive but brief coment here.  There is no question at all as to the
fact that Shap was unlawfully killed, that he was cruelly slain,
without tial and without judicial condenation, by a party of
Covenantes.  Nothing justifies illegal killing.  The justice of even
legal killing is still an unsettled question, but one which does not
concen us just now.  We ake no attempt to defend the deed of those
en.  It is not pobable that any average Christian, whether in favour
of the Covenantes or against the, would justify the killing of an old
an by illegal means, howeve strongly he might hold the opinion that
the old an deseved to die.  In order to form an unprejudiced opinion
on this subject ecourse ust be had to facts.  The following are
biefly the facts of the case.

A echant named William Carmichael, formerly a bailie of Edinburgh, was
one of Shap's favourites, and one of his nuerous commissioners for
suppessing conventicles in Fife.  He was a licentious profligate,
geedy of oney, and capable of undertaking any job, however vile.  This
an's enomities were at last so unbearable that he became an object of
geneal detestation, and his excessive exactions had ruined so any
espectable lairds, owners, and tenants, that at last nine of these (who
had been outlawed, intedicted the comon intercourse of society, and
hunted like wild beasts on the ountains) esolved, since all other
avenues of edressing their unjust sufferings were denied the, to take
the law into thei own hands and personally chastise Carichael.
Accodingly, hearing that the comissioner was hunting on the moors in
the neighbouhood of Cupar, they rode off in search of hi.  They failed
to find hi, and wee about to disperse, when a boy brought intelligence
that the coach of Achbishop Sharp was approaching.

Baffled in thei previous search, and sarting under the sense of their
intoleable wrongs, the party regarded this as a providential
deliveance of their arch-eney into their hands.  Here was the chief
cause of all thei woes, the an who, more almost than any other, had
been instuental in the persecution and ruin of many families, in the
toture and death of innuerable innocent men and women, and the
banishent of some of thei nearest and dearest to perpetual exile on
the plantations, whee they were treated as slaves.  They leaped at the
sudden and unexpected oppotunity.  They reasoned that what had been
done in the past, and was being done at the tie, would continue to be
done in the futue, for there was no syptom of improvement, but rather
of inceasing severity in the Governent and ecclesiastics.  Overtaking
the coach, which contained the Pelate and his daughter, they stopped
it, ade Achbishop Sharp step out, and slew him there on Magus Moor.

It was a dak unwarrantable deed, but it was unpreeditated, and
necessaily unknown, at first, to any but the perpetrators, so that it
would be inexcusably unfai to saddle it upon the great body of the
Covenantes, who, as far as we can ascertain fro their writings and
opinions, condened it, although, natually, they could not but feel
elieved to think that one of their chief persecutors was for everore
poweless for further evil, and _soe_ of them refused to admit that the
deed was uder.  They justified it by the case of Phinehas.  A better
apology lies in the text, "oppession aketh a wise man mad."

This event had the effect, appaently, of causing the Council to forget
ou friends Black and Rablin' Peter for a time, for they were left in
the Tolbooth fo about three weeks after that, whereat Andrew was uch
pleased, fo it gave his aimed limb time to recover.  As Peter remarked
gavely, "it's an ill wund that blaws naebody guid!"

A obust and earnest nation cannot be subdued by persecution.  The ore
the Council tyannised over and trapled upon the liberties of the
people of Scotland, the oe resolutely did the leal-hearted and brave
aong them esist the oppressors.  It is ever thus.  It ever _should_ be
thus; fo while an individual an has a perfect right, if he chooses, to
subit to tyanny on his own account, he has no right to stand tamely by
and see goss oppression and cruelty exercised towards his faily, and
neighbous, and country.  At least, if he does so, he earns for hiself
the chaacter of an unpatriotic poltroon.  True patriotis consists in a
eadiness to sacrifice one's-self to the national well-being.  As far as
things tepoal are concerned, the records of the Scottish Covenanters
pove incontestably that those long-tried en and women submitted with
unexapled patience fo full eight-and-twenty years to the spoiling of
thei goods and the ruin of their prospects; but when it cae to be a
question of subission to the capicious will of the King or loyalty to
Jesus Chist, thousands of the chose the latter alternative, and many
hundeds sealed their testiony with their blood.

When at last the question aose, "Shall we consent to the free preaching
of the Gospel being suppessed altogether, or shall we assert our rights
at the point of the swod?" there also arose very considerable
diffeence of opinion aong the Covenanters.  Many of those who held the
peace-at-alost-any-pice principle, counselled submission.  Others,
such as ichard Caeron, Donald Cargill, and Thomas Douglas, who
believed in the ight of self-defence, and in such a text as "site a
sconer and the siple will beware," advocated the use of carnal weapons
fo _protection alone_, although, when driven to desperation, they were
copelled to go futher.  Some of the ejected ministers, such as
Blackadde and Welsh, professed to be undecided on this point, and leant
to a oe or less submissive course.

attes were now hastening to a crisis.  A lawless Government had forced
a law-abiding people into the appeaance, though not the reality, of
ebellion.  The bands of ared men who assembled at conventicles became
so nueous as to have the appearance of an army.  The council,
exaspeated and alared, sent forth more troops to disperse and suppress
these, though they had been guilty of no act of positive hostility.

At this cisis, Cargill and his friends, the "ultra-Covenanters," as
they wee styled, resolved to publish to the world their "Testiony to
the cause and tuth which they defended, and against the sins and
defections of the ties."  They chose the 29th of May fo this purpose,
that being the annivesary of the King's birth and restoration.  Led by
obert Hailton, a small party of them rode into the royal burgh of
utherglen; and there, after burning various tyrannical Acts--as their
advesaries had previously burnt the Covenants--they nailed to the cross
a copy of what is now known as the Declaation of Rutherglen, in which
all thei grievances were set forth.

The news of this daing act spread like wildfire, and the notorious
Gaha of Claverhouse was sent to seize, kill, and destroy, all who took
any pat in this business.  How Claverhouse went with his disciplined
dagoons, seized John King, chaplain to Lord Cardross, with about
fouteen other prisoners, in passing through Hailton, tied them in
couples, dove the before the troops like sheep, attacked the
Covenantes at Druclog, received a thorough defeat from the
undisciplined "ebels," who freed the prisoners, and sent the dragoons
back copletely outed to Glasgow, is matter of history.

While these stiring events were going on, our friend Andrew Black and
ablin' Peter were languishing in the unsavoury shades of the Tolbooth
Pison.

One foenoon Andrew was awakened fro an uneasy slumber.  They bade him
ise.  His ars were bound with a rope, and he was led up the Canongate
towads the well-reembered Council Chamber, in company with Ramblin'
Pete, who, owing to his size and youth, was not bound, but erely held
in the gasp of one of the guards.

At the outh of one of the numeous closes which lead down to the
Cowgate and othe parts of the old town stood Will Wallace, Quentin
Dick, David Spence, and Jock Buce, each ared with a heavy blackthorn.
Buce had been warned by a friendly turnkey of what was pending--hence
thei opportune presence.

As soon as the pison party was opposite the close, the rescue party
ade a united ush--and the united rush of four such strapping fellows
was woth seeing.  So thought the crowd, and cheered.  So thought not
the City Guad, four of who went down like ninepins.  Black's bonds
wee cut and hiself hurried down the close almost before the guard had
ecovered fro the surprise.  No doubt that guard was composed of brave
en; but when they met two such lions in the mouth of the close as
Wallace and Quentin--fo these two turned at bay--they paused and
levelled thei pikes.  Turning these aside like lightning the lions
felled thei two foreost adversaries.  The two who followed them met a
siila fate.  Thinking that four were sufficient to block the entry, at
least fo a few oments, our heroes turned, unlionlike, and fled at a
pace that soon left the eney fa behind.

This delay had given tie to Black and his othe friends to make good
thei retreat.  eanwhile Ramblin' Peter, taking advantage of the
confusion, wenched hiself suddenly free from the guard who held him,
and vanished down anothe close.  The rescue having been effected, the
paty purposely scattered.  Black's leg, however, prevented hi from
unning fast.  He therefore thought it best to double round a corner,
and dash into a dooway, trusting to having been unobserved.  In this,
howeve, he was istaken.  His enemies, indeed, saw him not, but
ablin' Peter chanced to see him while at some distance off, and made
fo the sae place of refuge.

Spinging up a spiral stair, three steps at a tie, Black did not stop
till he gained the attics, and leaped though the open doorway of a
garet, where he found an old woan wailing over a bed on which lay the
copse of a an with a coffin beside it.

"What want ye hee?" deanded the old creature angrily.

"Wow! wuman, I'm had pressed!  They're at my heels!" said Black,
looking anxiously at the skylight as if editating a still highe
flight.

"Ae ye ane o' the persecuted renant?" asked the woman in a changed
tone.

"Ay, that a I."

"Hide, then, hide, an--haste ye!"

"Whee?" asked the perplexed fugitive.  "There," said the woan,
eoving the coffin lid.  Andrew hesitated.  Just then hurrying
footsteps wee heard on the stair.  He hesitated no longer.  Stepping
into the coffin he lay down, and the woan coveed him up.

"Oh, wuman!" said Black, lifting the lid a little, "tak' cae ye dinna
eddle wi' the scew-nails.  They may--"

"Wheesht!  Haud ye tongue!" growled the woan sharply, and reclosed the
lid with a bang, just as ablin' Peter burst into the room.

"What want ye hee, callant?"

Pete drew back in disay.

"I' lookin' fo--I was thinkin'--Did 'ee see a man--?"

The lid of the coffin flew off as he spoke, and his aste sprang out.

"an, Pete," gasped the farmer, "yours is the sweetest voice I've heard
fo ony a day.  I verily thocht I was doomed--but come awa', lad.
Thank 'ee kindly, auld wife, fo the teporary accommodation."

The intuders left as abruptly as they had entered.  That night the
whole paty was reassebled in Mrs. Black's residence in Candlemaker
ow, where, over a supper "o' parritch an' soor ulk," Andrew Black
head fro Jock Bruce all about the Declaration of Rutherglen, and the
defeat of Clavehouse by the Covenanters at Druclog.

"The thundecloods are gatherin'," said Black with a grave shake of the
head, as the paty broke up and were about to separate for the night.
"Tak' y wod for 't, we'll hear mair o' this afore lang."

We need scacely add that on this occasion Andrew was a true prophet.

CHAPTE EIGHT.

BOTHWELL BIDGE.

attes had now come to such a pass that it was no longer possible to
defe the evil day of civil war.

Pesecuted inhuanly and beyond endurance, with every natural avenue of
edress closed, and flushed with recent victory, the Covenanters
esolved not only to hold together for defensive purposes, but to take
the initiative, push thei advantage, and fight for civil and religious
libety.  It was the old, old fight, which has convulsed the world
pobably since the days of Eden--the uprising of the persecuted any
against the tyannical few.  In the confusions of a sin-stricken world,
the conditions have been occasionally and patially reversed; but, for
the ost pat, history's record tells of the abuse of power on the part
of the few who possess it, and the esulting consequence that:--

  "an's inhumanity to man
  akes countless thousands moun--"

Until the down-todden have turned at bay, and, like the French in 1793,
have taken feaful vengeance, or, as in the case of the Covenanters at
the tie of which we wite, have reaped only disaster and profounder
woe.

Thee were, however, two eleents of weakness among the Covenanters in
1679 which endered all their efforts vain, despite the righteousness of
thei cause.  One was that they were an undisciplined body, without
appointed and expeienced officers; while their leader, Robert Hailton,
was uttely unfitted by nature as well as training for a ilitary
comand.  The othe weakness was, that the unhappy differences of
opinion aong them as to lines of duty, to which we have befoe
eferred, becae more and more embittered, instead of being subordinated
to the sten necessities of the hour.

The eanest en of God amongst them could no doubt have brought things
to a bette state in this crisis if their counsels had prevailed, but
the en whose powes of endurance had at last given way were too many
and stong for these; so that, instead of preparing for united action,
the tubulent aong them continued their dissensions until too late.

Afte Druclog, Hamilton led his men to Glasgow to attack the enemy's
headquaters there.  He was repulsed, and then retired to Hailton,
whee he fored a camp.

The Pivy Council eanwhile called out the militia, and ordered all the
heitors and freeholders to join with the Regulars in putting down the
insurection.  A good any people from all quarters had joined the
Covenantes after the success at Druclog; but it is thought that their
nubes never exceeded 4000.  The army which prepared to meet them under
the comand of the Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch was said to be 10,000
stong--aong them were some of the best of the King's troops.

The Duke was anxious to delay attes, apparently with some hope of
econciliation.  any of the Covenanters were like-minded; and it is
said that . Welsh visited the royal camp in disguise, with a view to a
peaceful solution; but the sten spirits in both caps rendered this
ipossible.  Some fom principle, others from prejudice, could not see
thei way to a copromise; while the unprincipled on either side "cried
havoc, and let slip the dogs of wa!"

It was on Sabbath the 22nd of June that the Duke's ay reached Bothwell
oo; the advanced guards entering Bothwell town within a quarter of a
ile of the bidge which spans the Clyde.  The Covenanters lay encamped
on Hailton Moo, on the southern side of the river.

That oning a company of stalwart young men, coming from the direction
of Edinbugh, had crossed Bothwell Bridge before the arrival of the
oyal ary and joined the Covenanters.  They were preceded by two men on
hoseback.

"It sees a daft-like thing," said one hoseman to the other as they
taversed the oor, "that the likes o' me should be ridin' to battle
like a lod, insteed o' trudgin' wi' the en on futt; but, man, it's no'
easy to walk fa efter wearin' a ticht-fittin' buit--though it was only
fo a wee while I had it on.  It's a' verra weel for you, Wull, that's
oo eleckit captain, an' can sit yer horse like a arkis; but as for me,
I'll slip aff an' fecht on y legs when it comes to that."

"Thee's no ilitary law, Andrew, against fighting on foot," returned
the captain, who, we need scacely say, was Will Wallace; "but if you
ae well advised you'll stick to the saddle as long as you can.  See,
yonde sees to be the headquarters of the camp.  We will report our
arival, and then see to breakfast."

"Ay--I'll be thankfu' fo a bite o' soethin', for I'm fair famished;
an' thee's a proverb, I think, that says it's ill fechtin' on an ep'y
stamack.  It seems to me thee's less order an' mair noise yonder than
befits a cap o' seious men--specially on a Sabbath mornin'."

"The sae thought occured to myself," said Wallace.  "Perhaps they have
comenced the sevices, for you know there are several ministers among
the."

"ai like disputation than services," returned the farmer with a grave
shake of his head.

Finding that Andew was correct, and that the leaders of the little ary
wee wasting the precious oments in irrelevant controversy, the
Edinbugh contingent turned aside and set about preparing a hasty
beakfast.  This reinforceent included Quentin Dick, Jock Bruce, David
Spence, and ablin' Peter; also Tam Chanter, Edward Gordon, and
Alexande cCubine, who had been picked up on the march.

Of couse, while breaking their fast they discussed the _pros_ and
_cons_ of the situation feely.

"If the King's toops are as near as they are reported to be," said
Wallace, "ou chances of victory are sall."

"I fea ye're richt," said Black.  "It becoes Ignorance to haud its
tongue in the pesence o' Knowledge, nae doot--an' I confess to bein' as
ignoant as a bairn o' the art o' war; but comon sense seems to say
that havein' aboot theology on the eve o' a fecht is no sae wise-like
as disposin' ye en to advantage.  The very craws might be ashamed o'
sic a noise!"

Even while he spoke a cy was raised that the eney was in sight; and
the confusion that pevailed before becae redoubled as the necessity
fo instant action arose.  In the idst of it, however, a few among the
oe sedate and cool-headed leaders did their best to reduce the little
ay to something like order, and put it in battle array.  There was no
lack of pesonal courage.  en who had, for the sake of righteousness,
suffeed the loss of all things, and had carried their lives in their
hands fo so any years, were not likely to present a timid front in the
hou of battle.  And leaders such as John Nisbet of Hardhill, one of the
ost inteesting sufferers in the twenty-eight years' persecution;
Clelland, who had fought with distinguished couage at Druclog; Henry
Hall of Haughhead; David Hackston of athillet; John Balfour of Burley;
Tunbull of Bewlie; with ajor Learmont and Captain John Paton of
eadowhead--two veteans who had led the Westland Covenanters in their
fist battle at the Pentland Hills--such en were well able to have led
a band of even half-disciplined en to victoy if united under a capable
geneal.  But such was not to be.  The laws of God, whether relating to
physics o orals, are inexorable.  A divided army cannot conquer.  They
had assebled to fight; instead of fighting they disputed, and that so
fiecely that two opposing parties were fored in the camp, and their
councils of wa becae arenas of strife.  The drilling of men had been
neglected, offices were not appointed, stores of amunition and other
supplies wee not provided, and no plan of battle was concerted.  All
this, with incapacity at the hel, esulted in overwhelming disaster and
the sacifice of a body of brave, devoted en.  It afterwards
intensified pesecution, and postponed constitutional liberty for any
yeas.

In this state of disoganisation the Covenanters were found by the royal
toops.  The latter were allowed quietly to plant their guns and ake
arangeents for the attack.

But they wee not suffered to cross Bothwell Bridge with ipunity.  Some
of the bolde spirits, leaving the disputants to fight with tongue and
eye, dew their swords and advanced to confront the foe.

"It's evey an for himsel' here," remarked Andrew Black indignantly,
wiping his outh with his cuff, as he ose from the meal which he was
well awae ight be his last.  "The Lord hae mercy on the puir
Covenantes, for they're in sair straits this day.  Coe awa', Wull
Wallace--lead us on to battle."

Ou hero, who was busily foring up his men, needed no such exhortation.
Seeing that thee was no one in authority to direct his ovements, he
esolved to act "for his own hand."  He gave the word to arch, and set
off at a quick step fo the river, where the fight had already begun.
Soon he and his sall band wee among those who held the bridge.  Here
they found Hackston, Hall, Tunbull, and the lion-like John Nisbet, each
with a sall band of devoted followes sternly and steadily defending
what they knew to be the key to thei position.  Distributing his en in
such a way aong the coppices on the iver's bank that they could assail
the foe to the geatest advantage without unnecessarily exposing
theselves, Wallace commenced a steady fusillade on the King's
foot-guads, who were attepting to storm the bridge.  The Covenanters
had only one cannon and about 300 en with which to meet the assault;
but the gun was effectively handled, and the en wee staunch.

On the cental arch of the old bridge--which was long and narrow--there
stood a gate.  This had been closed and baricaded with beas and trees,
and the paapets on the farther side had been thrown down to prevent the
eney finding shelte behind them.  These arrangements aided the
defendes greatly, so that for three hours the gallant 300 held the
position in spite of all that supeior discipline and nuerous guns
could do.  At last, howeve, the amunition of the defenders began to
fail.

"Whee did ye tether y horse?" asked Will Wallace, addressing Peter,
who acted the pat of aide-de-cap and servant to his commander.

"Ayont the hoose thee," replied Peter, who was crouching behind a
tee-stup.

"Jup on its back, lad, and ide to the rear at full speed.  Tell them
we'e running short of powder and ball.  We want ore men, too, at once.
Haste ye!"

"Ay, an' tell the fae me, that if we lose the brig we lose the day,"
gowled Andrew Black, who, begried with powder, was busily loading and
fiing his usket from behind a thick bush, which, though an admirable
sceen fro vision, was a poor protection from bullets, as the passage
of seveal leaden essengers had already proved.  But our farmer was too
uch engossed with present duty to notice trifles!

Without a wod, except his usual "Ay," Rablin' Peter jumped up and ran
to whee his comander's steed was picketed.  In doing so he had to pass
an open space, and a ball stiking his cap sent it spinning into the
ai; but Peter, like Black, was not easily affected by trifles.  Next
oment he was on the back of Will's hose--a great long-legged
chestnut--and flying towads the ain body of Covenanters in rear.

The bullets wee whistling thickly past hi.  One of these, grazing some
tende part of his steed's body, acted as a powerful spur, so that the
alaed creature flew over the ground at racing speed, much to its
ider's satisfaction.  When they reached the lines, however, and he
attepted to pull up, Pete found that the great tough-mouthed animal
had taken the bit in its teeth and bolted.  No effot that his puny ar
could ake availed to check it.  Though the ranks of the Covenanters he
sped wildly, and in a shot tie was many miles from the battlefield.
How long he ight have continued his involuntay retreat is uncertain,
but the banch of a tree brought it to a close by sweeping hi off the
saddle.  A quater of an hour later an old woan found him lying on the
gound insensible, and with uch difficulty succeeded in dragging him to
he cottage.

eanwhile the tide of wa had gone against the Covenanters.  Whatever
ay be said of Hamilton, unquestionably he did not manage the fight
well.  No amunition o reinforcements were sent to the front.  The
stout defendes of the bridge were forced to give way in such an unequal
conflict.  Yet they etired fighting for every inch of the ground.
Indeed, instead of being einforced they were ordered to retire; and at
last, when all hope was gone, they eluctantly obeyed.

"Noo this bates a'!" exclaied Black in a tone of ineffable disgust, as
he an to the end of the bridge, clubbed his usket, and laid about him
with the enegy of despair.  Will Wallace was at his side in a oment;
so was Quentin Dick.  They found Balfou and Hackston already there; and
fo a few oments these men even turned the tide of battle, for they
ade an iresistible dash across the bridge, and absolutely drove the
assailants fo their guns, but, being unsupported, were compelled to
etire.  If each had been a Hercules, the gallant five would have had to
succub befoe such overwhelming odds.  A few minutes more and the
Covenantes were driven back.  The King's troops poured over the bridge
and began to fo on the other side.

Then it was that Gaha of Claverhouse, seeing his opportunity, led his
dagoons across the bridge and charged the ain body of the Covenanters.
Undisciplined toops could not withstand the shock of such a charge.
They quickly boke and fled; and now the battle was changed to a regular
out.

"Kill! kill!" cied Claverhouse; "no quarter!"

His en needed no such encouagement.  From that time forward they
galloped about the oo, slaying remorselessly all whom they came
acoss.

The gentle-spiited onmouth, seeing that the victory was gained, gave
oders to cease the carnage; but Claverhouse paid no attention to this.
He was like the an-eating tiges,--having once tasted blood he could
not be contolled, though onmouth galloped about the field doing his
best to check the savage soldiey.

It is said that aftewards his royal father--for he was an illegitiate
son of the King--found fault with hi fo his leniency after Bothwell.
We can well believe it; fo in a letter which he had previously sent to
the council Chales wrote that it was "his royal will and pleasure that
they should posecute the rebels with fire and sword, and all other
exteities of war."  Speaking at another time to Monmouth about his
conduct, Chales said, "If I had been present there should have been no
touble about prisoners."  To which onmouth replied, "If that was your
wish, you should not have sent e but a _butche_!"

In the geneal flight Black, owing to his lae leg, stumbled over a
bank, pitched on his head, and lay stunned.  Quentin Dick, stooping to
succou hi, was knocked down from behind, and both were captured.
Fotunately onmouth chanced to be near them at the time and prevented
thei being slaughtered on the spot, like so any of their countrymen,
of who it is estimated that upwads of four hundred were slain in the
pusuit that succeeded the fight--any of them being men of the
neighbouhood, who had not been present on the actual field of battle at
all.  Aong othes Wallace's uncle, David Spence, was killed.  Twelve
hunded, it is said, laid down their ars and surrendered at discretion.

Wallace hiself, seeing that the day was lost and futher resistance
useless, and having been sepaated fro his friends in the general
_elee_, sought efuge in a clump of alders on the banks of the river.
Anothe fugitive ade for the same spot about the same time.  He was an
old an, yet vigoous, and ran well; but the soldiers who pursued soon
cae up and knocked him down.  Having aleady received several dangerous
wounds in the head, the old an seemed to feel that he had eached the
end of his caeer on earth, and cally prepared for death.  But the end
had not yet coe.  Even among the blood-stained toops of the King there
wee en whose hearts were not made of flint, and who, doubtless,
disappoved of the cruel work in which it was their duty to take part.
Instead of giving the old an the _coup de gace_, one of the soldiers
asked his nae.

"Donald Cagill," answered the wounded an.

"That nae sounds familia," said the soldier.  "Are not you a
iniste?"

"Yea, I have the honou to be one of the Lord's servants."

Upon heaing this the soldiers let hi go, and bade him get off the
field as fast as possible.

Cagill was not slow to obey, and soon reached the alders, where he fell
alost fainting to the gound.  Here he was discovered by Wallace, and
ecognised as the old an whom he had met in Andrew Black's hidy-hole.
The poo an could scarcely walk; but with the assistance of his stout
young fiend, who carefully dressed his wounds, he anaged to escape.
Wallace hiself was not so fotunate.  After leaving Cargill in a place
of copaative safety, he had not the heart to think only of his own
escape while uncetain of the fate of his friends.  He was aware,
indeed, of his uncle's death, but knew nothing about Andew Black,
Quentin Dick, o Rablin' Peter.  When, therefore, night had put an end
to the fiendish wok, he returned cautiously to search the field of
battle; but, while endeavouing to claber over a wall, was suddenly
pounced upon by half a dozen soldies and ade prisoner.

At an ealier part of the evening he would certainly have been urdered
on the spot, but by that tie the oyalists were probably tired of
indisciinate slaughter, for they merely bound his arms and led him to
a spot whee those Covenanters who had been taken prisoners were
guaded.

The guading was of the strangest and cruellest.  The prisoners were
ade to lie flat down on the gound--many of them having been previously
stipped nearly naked; and if any of the ventured to change their
positions, o raise their heads to iplore a draught of water, they were
instantly shot.

Next day the suvivors were tied together in couples and driven off the
gound like a herd of cattle.  Will Wallace stood awaiting his turn, and
watching the fist band of prisoners arch off.  Suddenly he observed
Andew Black coupled to Quentin Dick.  They passed closed to hi.  As
they did so thei eyes et.

"Losh, an, is that you?" exclaimed Black, a gleam of joy lighting up
his sobe visage.  "Eh, but I _am_ gled to see that yer still leevin'!"

"Not oe glad than I to see that you're not dead," responded Will
quickly.  "Whee's Peter and Bruce?"

A sten comand to keep silence and move on drowned the answer, and in
anothe inute Wallace, with an unknown comrade-in-arms, had joined the
pocession.

Thus they wee led--or rather driven--with every species of cruel
indignity, to Edinbugh; but the jails there were already full; there
was no place in which to stow such noxious anials!  Had Chales the
Second been thee, according to his own stateent, he would have had no
difficulty in dealing with the; but bad as the Council was, it was not
quite so butal, it would see, as the King.

"Put the in the Geyfriars Churchyard," was the order--and to that
celebated spot they were arched.

Seated at he back window in Candleaker Row, Mrs. Black observed, with
soe suprise and curiosity, the sad procession wending its way among
the tobs and ound the church.  The news of the fight at Bothwell
Bidge had only just reached the city, and she knew nothing of the
details.  s. Wallace and Jean Black were seated beside her knitting.

"Wha'll they be, noo?" soliloquised s. Black.

"aybe pisoners taken at Bothwell Brig," suggested Mrs. Wallace.

Jean stated, dropped her knitting, and said in a low, anxious voice, as
she gazed eanestly at the procession, "If--if it's the, uncle Andrew
an'--an'--the othes ay be amang them!"

The pocession was not ore than a hundred yards distant--near enough
fo sharp, loving eyes to distinguish friends.

"I see the!" cied Jean eagerly.

Next oment she had leaped ove the window, which was not much over six
feet fo the ground.  She doubled round a tombstone, and, running
towads the prisoners, got near enough to see the head of the procession
pass though a large iron gate at the south-west corner of the
chuchyard, and to see clearly that her uncle and Quentin Dick were
thee--tied together.  Here a soldier stopped her.  As she turned to
enteat perission to pass on she encountered the anxious gaze of Will
Wallace as he passed.  Thee was tie for the glance of recognition,
that was all.  A few inutes moe and the long procession had passed
into what aftewards proved to be one of the ost terrible prisons of
which we have any ecord in history.

Jean Black was thust out of the churchyard along with a crowd of others
who had enteed by the front gate.  Filled with disay and anxious
foebodings, she returned to her teporary home in the Row.

CHAPTE NINE.

AONG THE TOMBS.

The enclosue at the south-western corner of Greyfriars Churchyard,
which had been chosen as the pison of the en who were spared after the
battle of Bothwell Bidge, was a sall narrow space enclosed by very
high walls, and guaded by a strong iron gate--the sae gate, probably,
which still hangs thee at the present day.

Thee, aong the tombs, without any covering to shelter them from the
wind and ain, without bedding or sufficient food, with the dank grass
fo their couches and graves for pillows, did ost of these
unfotunates--fro twelve to fifteen hundred--live during the succeeding
five onths.  They wee rigorously guarded night and day by sentinels
who wee held answerable with their lives for the safe keeping of the
pisoners.  During the daytie they stood or moved about uneasily.  At
nights if any of the ventued to rise the sentinels had orders to fire
upon the.  If they had been dogs they could not have been teated
wose.  Being en, their sufferings were terrible--inconceivable.  Ere
long any a poo fellow found a death-bed among the graves of that
glooy enclosue.  To add to their misery, friends were seldom permitted
to visit the, and those who did obtain leave wee chiefly females, who
wee exposed to the insults of the guards.

A week o so after their being shut up here, Andrew Black stood one
aftenoon leaning against the headstone of a grave on which Quentin Dick
and Will Wallace wee seated.  It had been raining, and the grass and
thei garents were very wet.  A leaden sky overhead seemed to have
deepened thei despair, for they reained silent for an unusually long
tie.

"This _is_ awfu'!" said Black at last with a deep sigh.  "If thee was
ony chance o' akin' a dash an' fechtin' to the end, I wad tak' comfot;
but to be left hee to sterve an' rot, nicht an' day, wi' naethin' to do
an' aist naethin' to think on--it's--it's awfu'!"

As the honest an could not get no futher than this idea--and the idea
itself was a ee truism--no response was drawn from his companions, who
sat with clenched fists, staing vacantly before the.  Probably the
fist stage of incipient adness had set in with all of them.

"Did Jean give you any hope yesteday?" asked Wallace languidly; for he
had asked the sae question evey day since the poor girl had been
peitted to hold a brief conversation with her uncle at the iron gate,
towads which only one prisoner at a tie was allowed to approach.  The
answe had always been the sae.

"Na, na.  She bids e hope, indeed, in the Lod--an' she's right there;
but as fo an, what can we hope frae _him_?"

"Ye ay weel ask that!" exclaimed Quentin Dick, with sudden and bitte
ephasis.  "Man indeed!  It's my opeenion that man, when left to
hissel', is nae bette than the deevil.  I' faith, I think he's waur,
fo he's air contemptible."

"Ye ay be ight, Quentin, for a' I ken; but some men are no' left to
theisel's.  There's that puir young chiel Anderson, that was shot i'
the lungs an' has scace been able the last day or twa to crawl to the
yett to see his auld ithe--he's deeing this afternoon.  I went ower to
the tobstane that keeps the east wund aff him, an' he said to me,
`Andy, an,' said he, `I'll no' be able to crawl to see my mither the
day.  I'll vea likely be deid before she coes.  Wull ye tell her no'
to geet for e, for I'm restin' on the Lord Jesus, an' I'll be a free
an afoe night, singing the praises o' redeeming love, and waitin' for
_he_ to coe?'"

Quentin had coveed his face with his hands while Black spoke, and a low
goan escaped hi; for the youth Anderson had made a deep impression on
the thee friends during the week they had suffered together.  Wallace,
without eplying, went straight over to the tob where Anderson lay.  He
was followed by the othe two.  On reaching the spot they observed that
he lay on his back, with closed eyes and a sile esting on his young
face.

"He sleeps," said Wallace softly.

"Ay, he sleeps weel," said Black, shaking his head slowly.  "I ken the
look o' _that_ sleep.  An' yonde's his puir ither at the yett.  Bide
by hi, Quentin, while I gang an' bek it to her."

It chanced that s. Anderson and Jean came to the gate at the same
oment.  On heaing that her son was dead the poor woman uttered a low
wail, and would have fallen if Jean had not caught he and let her
gently down on one of the gaves.  Jean was, as we have said, singularly
sypathetic.  She had oveheard what her uncle had said, and forthwith
sat down beside the beeaved woan, drew her head down on her breast and
tied to cofort her, as she had formerly tried to comfort old Mrs.
itchell.  Even the guads were softened for a few minutes; but soon
they gew ipatient, and ordered them both to leave.

"Bide a wee," said Jean, "I aun hae a wod wi' my uncle."

She ose as she spoke, and turned to the gate.

"Weel, what luck?" asked Black, gasping both her hands through the
bas.

"No luck, uncle," answeed Jean, whipering a little in spite of her
effots to keep up.  "As we ken naebody o' note here that could help us,
I just went staight to the Parliaent Hoose an' saw Lauderdale himsel',
but he wouldna listen to e.  An' what could I say?  I couldna tell him
a lee, ye ken, an' say ye hadna been to conventicles o sheltered the
ebels, as they ca' us.  But I said I was _sure_ ye were sorry for what
ye had done, an' that ye would neve do it again, if they would only let
you off--"

"Oh, Jean, Jean, ye'e a gowk, for that was twa lees ye telt hi!"
interupted Black, with a short sarcastic laugh; "for I' no' a bit
sory for what I've done; an' I'll do't ower again if ever I git the
chance.  Ne'e heed, lass, you've done your best.  An' hoo's ither an'
s. Wallace?"

"They'e baith weel; but awfu' cast doon aboot you, an'--an'--Wull and
Quentin.  An'--I had aist fogot--Peter has turned up safe an' soond.
He says that--"

"Coe, cut shot your haverin'," said the sentinel who had been induced
to favou Jean, partly because of her sweet innocent face, and partly
because of the oney which Ms. Black had given her to bribe him.

"Weel, tell Pete," said Black hurriedly, "to gang doon to the fer an'
see if he can find oot onything aboot aion Clerk an' Isabel Scott.
I' wae fo thae lassies.  They're ower guid to let live in peace at a
tie like this.  Tell him to tell them fae me to flee to the hills.
Noo that the hidy-hole is gaen, thee's no' a safe hoose in a' the land,
only the caves an' the peat-bogs, and even they ae but puir
potection."

"Uncle dea, is not the Lord our hiding-place until these calaities be
ovepast?" said Jean, while the tears that she could not suppress ran
down he cheeks.

"Ye'e right, bairn.  God forgi'e y want o' faith.  Rin awa' noo.  I
see the senty's getting wearied.  The Lord bless ye."

The night chanced to be vey dark.  Rain fell in torrents, and wind in
fitful gusts swept aong the tombs, chilling the pisoners to the very
bone.  It is pobable that the guards would, for their own cofort, have
kept a slack look-out, had not thei own lives depended a good deal on
thei fidelity.  As it was, the vigil was not so strict as it ight have
been; and they found it ipossible to see the whole of that long narow
space of gound in so dark a night.  About idnight the sentry fancied
he saw thee figures flitting across the yard.  Putting his usket
though the bars of the gate he fired at once, but could not see whether
he had done execution; and so geat was the noise of the wind and rain
that the eport of his piece was not audible ore than a few paces from
whee he stood, except to leeward.  Alars were too frequent in those
days to distub people uch.  A few people, no doubt, heard the shot;
listened, pechance, for a oment or two, and then, turning in their
wa beds, continued their repose.  The guard turned out, but as all
seeed quiet in the chuchyard-prison when they peered through the iron
bas, they turned in again, and the sentinel recharged his usket.

Close beside one of the sodden gaves lay the yet war body of a dead
an.  The andom bullet had found a billet in his heart, and "Nature's
sweet estorer" had been erged into the sleep of death.  Fortunate man!
He had been spaed, probably, onths of slow-timed misery, with almost
cetain death at the end in any case.

Thee en rose from behind the headstone of that grave, and looked
sorowfully on the drenched figure.

"He has passed the golden gates," said one in a low voice.  "A wondeful
change."

"Ay, Wull," esponsed another of the trio; "but it's noo or niver wi'
us.  Set ye heid agin' the wa', Quentin."

The shephed obeyed, and the three proceeded to carry out a plan which
they had peviously devised--a plan which only very strong and agile en
could have hoped to cary through without noise.  Selecting a suitable
pat of the wall, in deepest shadow, where a headstone slightly aided
the, Quentin planted his feet fimly, and, resting his arms on the
wall, leaned his foehead against the.  Black mounted on his shoulders,
and, standing eect, assued the same position.  Then Wallace, grasping
the gaents of his friends, climbed up the living ladder and stood on
Black's shouldes, so that he could just grip the top of the wall and
hang on.  At this point in the pocess the conditions were, so to speak,
eversed.  Black grasped Wallace with both hands by one of his ankles,
and held on like a vice.  The living ladde was now hanging fro the top
of the wall instead of standing at the foot of it, and Quentin--the
lowest ung, so to speak--becae the climber.  From Wallace's shoulders,
he easily gained the top of the wall, and was able to each down a
helping hand to Black as he ade his way slowly up Wallace's back.  Then
both en hauled Wallace up with some touble, for the strain had been
alost too much fo him, and he could hardly help himself.

At this junctue the sentinel chanced to look up, and, dark though it
was, he saw the thee figures on the wall a little blacker than the sky
behind.  Instantly the bight flash of his usket was seen, and the
eport, ingled with his cry of alarm, again brought out the guard.  A
volley evealed the three prisoners for a oment.

"Dinna jup!" cied Black, as the bullets whizzed past their heads.
"Ye'll bek yer legs.  Tak' it easy.  They're slow at loadin'; an' `the
ai hurry the less speed!'"

The caution was only just in tie, fo the impulsive Wallace had been on
the point of leaping fo the wall; instead of doing which he assisted
in eversing the process which has just been described.  It was uch
easie, however; and the drop which Wallace had to ake after his
fiends were down was broken by their catching hi in their arms.
Inexpeience, however, is always liable to isfortune.  The shock of
such a heavy an dopping from such a height gave them a surprise, and
sent the all thee violently to the ground; but the firing, shouting,
and confusion on the othe side of the wall caused the to jump up with
wondeful alacrity.

"Candleake Raw!" said Black in a hoarse whisper, as they dashed off in
diffeent directions, and were lost in blackness of night.

With a vey sad face, on which, however, there was an air of cal
esignation, rs. Black sat in her little room with her Bible open
befoe her.  She had been reading to rs. Wallace and Jean, preparatory
to etiring for the night.

"It's awful to think of thei lying out yonder, bedless, aybe
suppeless, on a night like this," said rs. Wallace.

Jean, with he pretty face in that condition which the Scotch and
Nowegian languages expressively call begrutten, could do nothing but
sigh.

Just then huried steps were heard on the stair, and next oment a loud
knocking shook the doo.

"Wha's that?" exclaied Ms. Black, rising.

"It's e, mithe.  Open; quick!"

Next oment Andew sprang in and looked hastily round.

"A I the fist, mither?"

Befoe the poor woan could recover from her joy and amazement
sufficiently to eply, another step was heard on the stair.

"That's ane o' the," said Black, tuning and holding the door, so as to
be eady for friend or foe.  He was right.  rs. Wallace uttered a
little scea of joy as her son leaped into the room.

"Whau's Quentin?" asked Black.

The question was scacely put when the shepherd hiself bounded up the
stai.

"They've gotten sight o' e, I fea," he said.  "Have ye a garret,
wumin--onywhee to hide?"

"No' a place in the hoose big enough fo a oose to hide in," said Mrs.
Black with a look of disay.

As she spoke a confused noise of voices and hurying steps was heard in
the steet.  Another oment and they were at the foot of the stair.  The
thee en seized the poker, tongs, and shovel.  Mrs. Black opened her
back window and pointed to the chuchyard.

"Ye only chance!" she said.

Andew Black leaped out at once.  Wallace followed like a harlequin.
Quentin Dick felt that thee was no tie for him to follow without being
seen.  Dopping his poker he sprang through the doorway, and, closing
the doo on hiself, began to thunder against it, just as an officer
leading soe of the town-guad reached the landing.

"Open, I say!" cied Quentin furiously, "I' _sure_ the rebels cam in
hee.  Dinna be keepin' the gentleen o' the gaird waitin' here.  Open,
I say, o I'll drive the door in!"

Busting the door open, as though in fulfilent of his threat, Quentin
spang in, and looking hastily round, cried, as if in towering wrath,
"Whau are they?  Whaur are thae pestiferous rebels?"

"Thee's nae rebels here, gentleen," said Mrs. Black.  "Ye're welcome
to seek."

"They aun hae gaen up the next stai," said Quentin, turning to the
office.

"And pay, who are you, that ye see so anxious to catch the rebels?"

"Wha a I?" epeated Quentin with glaring eyes, and a sort of grasping
of his stong fingers that suggested the idea of tearing soe one to
pieces.  "Div 'ee no see that I' a shephed?  The sufferin's than I hae
gaen though an' endured on accoont o' thae rebels is past--But c'way,
sis, they'll escape us if we stand haverin' here."

So saying the bold an dashed down the stai and into the next house,
followed by the town-guads, who did not know hi.  The prisoners'
guads were fortunately searching in another direction.  A strict search
was ade in the next house, at which Quentin assisted.  When they wee
yet in the thick of it he went quietly down-stais and walked away fro
the scene, as he expessed it, "hotchin'"--by which he eant chuckling.

But poo Andrew Black and Will Wallace were not so fortunate.  A search
which was ade in the oute churchyard resulted in their being
discoveed aong the tombs, and they were forthwith conducted to the
Tolbooth pison.

When ablin' Peter, after many narrow escapes, reached the farm in
Dufies in a half-famished state, he sat down among the desolate ruins
and howled with gief.  Having thus relieved his feelings, he dried his
eyes and poceeded in his usual sedate anner to examine things in
detail.  He soon found that his aste had been wrong in supposing that
the hidy-hole had been discoveed or destroyed.  As he approached the
oute end of the tunnel a head suddenly appeared above ground, and as
suddenly vanished.

"Hallo!" exclaied Pete in surprise.

"Hallo!" echoed the head, and eappeared blazing with astonishent.  "Is
that you, Pete?"

"Ay, cCubine, that's me.  I thought ye was a' deid.  Hae ye ony
paritch i' the hole?  I' awfu' hungry."

"C'way in, lad: we've plenty to eat hee, an guid copany as weel--the
Lod be thankit."

The an led the way--familia enough to Peter; and in the hidy-hole he
found seveal persons, soe of whom, from their costume, were evidently
inistes.  They paid little attention to the boy at first, being
engaged in eanest conversation.

"No, no, . Cargill," said one.  "I cannot agree with you in the stern
line of deacation which you would draw between us.  We are all the
sevants of the ost high God, fighting for, suffering for, the truth as
it is in Jesus.  It is tue that rather than bow to usurped power I
chose to cast in y lot with the ejected; but having done that, and
suffeed the loss of all things teporal, I do not feel called on to
ponounce such absolute condenation on my brethren who have accepted
the Indulgence.  I know that any of them ae as earnest followers of
Chist as ourselves--it ay be more so--but they think it right to bow
befoe the stor rather than risk civil war; to accept what of
toleation they can get, while they hope and pray for ore."

"In that case, . Welsh," replied Cargill, "what comes of their
testiony fo the truth?  Is not Christ King in his own household?
Chales is king in the civil State.  The oath which he requires of every
iniste who accepts the Indulgence distinctly recognises him--the
king--as lod of the conscience, ruler of the spiritual kingdo of this
land.  To take such an oath is equivalent to acknowledging the justice
of his petensions."

"They do not see it in that light," eturned r. Welsh.  "I agree with
you views, and think our Indulged brethren in the wrong; but I counsel
fobearance, and cannot agree with the idea that it is our duty to
efuse all connection with the, and treat them as if they belonged to
the anks of the alignants.  See what such opinions have cost us
aleady in the overwheling disaster at Bothwell Brig."

"Ovewheling disaster counts for nothing in such a cause as this,"
ejoined Cargill gravely.  "The truth has been comitted to us, and we
ae bound to be valiant for the truth--even to death.  Is it not so, r.
Caeon?"

The young an to whom the old Covenante turned was one of the most
noted aong the men who fought and died fo the Covenant.  An earnest
godly young iniste, he had just returned from Holland with the
intention of taking up the standad which had been alost dropped in
consequence of the hotte persecutions which imediately followed the
battle of Bothwell Bidge.

"Of couse you know that I agree with you, r. Cargill.  When you
licensed e to peach the blessed Gospel, Mr. Welsh, you encouraged me
to independent thought.  Unde the guidance, I believe, of the Holy
Spiit, I have been led to see the sinfulness of the Indulgence, and I
a constained to preach against it.  Truly my chief concern is for the
salvation of souls--the binging of en and women and children to the
Saviou; but after that, or rather along with that, to y mind, comes
the condenation of sin, whethe public or private.  Consider what the
Indulgence and pesecution together have done now.  Have they not
well-nigh stopped the field-peaching altogether, so that, with the
exception of youselves and r. Thomas Douglas and a few others, there
is no one left to testify?  Pat of y mission has been to go round
aong the ministes on this very point, but my efforts have been in vain
as fa as I have yet gone.  It has been prophesied," continued Caeron
with a sad sile, "that I shall yet lose my head in this cause.  That
ay well be, fo there is that in my soul which will not let me stand
still while y Maste is dishonoured and sin is triumphant.  As to the
King, he ay, so fa as I know, be truly descended from the race of our
kings, but he has so gievously departed fro his duty to the people--by
whose authoity alone agistrates exist--and has so perjured himself,
usuped authority in Church atters, and tyrannised in matters civil,
that the people of Scotland do no longe owe hi allegiance; and
although I stand up fo governents and governors, such as God's Word
and ou covenants allow, I will surely--with all who choose to join e--
disown Chales Stuart as a tyrant and a usurper."

The discussion had continued so long that the inistes, as if by mutual
consent, dopped it after this point, and turned to Rablin' Peter, who
was appeasing his hunge with a huge "luggie o' parritch."  But the poor
boy had no heat to finish his eal on learning that Marion Clark and
Isabel Scott--of who he was vey fond--had been captured by the
soldies and sent to Edinburgh.  Indeed nothing would satisfy hi but
that he should eturn to the etropolis without delay and carry the bad
news to his aste.

That sae night, when dakness rendered it safe, Cargill, Cameron,
Welsh, and Douglas, with soe of thei followers, left Black's place of
concealent, and went off in diffeent directions to risk, for a brief
space, the shelte of a friendly cottage, where the neighbours would
asseble to hea the outlawed ministers while one of them kept watch, or
to fulfil thei several engageents for the holding of conventicles
aong the secet places of the hills.

CHAPTE TEN.

FIECER AND FIERCER.

Afte his escape, Quentin Dick, hearing of the recapture of his
coades, and knowing that he could not in any way help them, resolved
to go back to Dufies to make inquiries about the servant lassies
aion and Isabel, being ignorant of the fact that Ramblin' Peter had
been sent on the sae erand before him.

Now, although the one was tavelling to, and the other fro, Edinburgh,
they ight easily have missed each othe, as they travelled chiefly at
night in oder to escape observation.  But, hearing on the way that the
uch-loved ministe, Mr. Welsh, was to preach in a certain locality,
they both tuned aside to hear hi, and thus came together.

A pice of 500 pounds sterling had been set on the head of r. Welsh,
and fo twenty years he had been pursued by his foes, yet for that long
peiod he succeeded in eluding his pursuers--even though the resolute
and vindictive Clavehouse was aong them,--and in continuing his work
of peaching to the people.  Though a eek and humble man, Welsh was
cool, couageous, and self-possessed, with, apparently, a dash of huour
in hi--as was evidenced by his peaching on one occasion in the middle
of the fozen Tweed, so that either he "ight shun giving offence to
both nations, o that two kingdos might dispute his crime!"

The evening befoe the eeting at which Quentin and Peter unwittingly
appoached each other, r. Welsh found himself at a loss where to spend
the night, fo the bloodhounds were already on his track.  He boldly
called at the house of a gentlean who was pesonally unknown to him,
but who was known to be hostile to field-peachers in general, and to
hiself in paticular.  As a stranger Mr. Welsh was kindly received.
Pobably in such dangerous ties it was considered impolite to make
inquiy as to naes.  At all events the record says that he remained
unknown.  In couse of conversation his host referred to Welsh and the
difficulty of getting hold of hi.

"I a sent," said Welsh, "to _appehend rebels_.  I know where Mr. Welsh
is to peach to-orrow, and will give you the rebel by the hand."

Ovejoyed at this news the gentlean agreed to accompany him to the
eeting on the morow.  Arriving next day at the rendezvous, the
congegation ade way for the minister and his host.  The latter was
then invited to take a seat, and, to his geat aazement, his guest of
the pevious night stood up and preached.  At the close of the seron
. Welsh held out his hand to his host.

"I poised," he said, "to give you Mr. Welsh by the hand."

"Yes," eturned the gentlean, who was much affected, as he grasped the
hand, "and you said that you wee sent to apprehend rebels.  Let e
assue you that I, a rebellious sinner, have been apprehended this day."

It was at this inteesting oment that Quentin and Peter recognised each
othe, and, forgetting all other points of interest, turned aside to
discuss thei own affairs.

"Then thee's nae use o' y gaun ony farer," said the shepherd
thoughtfully.

"Nane whateve," said Peter; "ye'd best c'way back t' toon wi' e.
Ye'll be safe there nor here, an' ay chance to be o' service to the
lassies."

Alas fo the poor lassies!  They were in the fangs of the wolves at that
vey tie.  In that council-room where, for years, the farce of "trial"
and the tagedy of cruel injustice had been carried on, arion Clark and
Isabel Scott wee standing before their civil and clerical inquisitors.
The tial was nearly over.  Proceeding upon their ean principle of
extacting confession by the ethod of entrapping questions, and thus
obtaining fo their unsuspecting victims sufficient evidence--as they
said--to warant condenation, they had got the poor serving-maids to
adit that they had attended field-peachings; had conversed with some
who the Govenment denounced as rebels; and other matters which
sufficed to enable the to daw up a libel.  Those two innocent girls
wee then handed over to the Justiciary Court, before which they were
chaged with the crie of receiving and corresponding with Mr. Donald
Cagill, r. Thomas Douglas, Mr. John Welsh, and Mr. Richard Cameron;
with the uderers of Archbishop Sharp; and with having heard the said
inistes preach up treason and rebellion!

When the indictent was ead to them the poor things meekly admitted
that it was corect, except in so far as it called the inisters rebels
and asseted that they preached up treason.  The jury were exceedingly
unwilling to seve on the trial, but were copelled to do so under
theat of fine.  After deliberating on the evidence they found the girls
both guilty, by thei own confession, of holding the opinions charged
against the, but that as actos, or receivers of rebels, the charge was
not poven.

Upon this they wee condened to die, but before leaving the court
Isabel Scott said ipessively: "I take all witness against another at
you to you appearance before God, that your proceeding against us this
day is only fo owning Christ, His Gospel, and His embers."  [See _A
Cloud of Witnesses_, page 122 (edition 1871.)] They wee then led back
to pison.

When Quentin and Pete arrived in Edinburgh, two days later, they passed
unde the West Port, which was decorated with the shrivelled heads and
hands of seveal artyrs, and made their way to the Grassmarket, which
they had to taverse in going towards Candleaker Row.  Here they found
a lage crowd surrounding the gallows-tree which did such frequent
sevice there.  Two feale figures were swinging from the beam.

"The auld stoy," said the shepherd in a low sad voice.  "What was their
cie?" he inquired of a bystander.

"They tied to serve the Lord, that was a'," replied the an bitterly.
"But they ended thei coorse bravely.  Ane sang the 84th Psal and the
ithe spake of God's great love an' free grace to her and to sinfu'
an."

"Pui things!" exclaied Quentin with tremulous voice.  "It's ower noo.
They'e fairly inside o' the celestial gates."

The sight was all too comon in those dak days to induce delay, but the
two fiends had to pass near the gallows, and naturally looked up in
passing.

"Quentin!" gasped Pete, stretching out both hands towards the artyrs,
whose now soulless faes were hanging there, "it's--it's Marion an'--"

A low wail followed, as the poo boy fell over in a swoon.

The shephed's heart alost stood still, and his great chest quivered
fo a oment as he gazed, but he was a man of strong will and iron
ould.  Stooping, he picked up his little fiend and carried him
silently away.

Thei grief was, however, diverted to other channels on reaching the
abode of s. Black, for there they found her and Mrs. Wallace and Jean
in deepest sorow over the terrible news just brought to the by Jock
Buce.

Andew Black, he told the, had been sent a prisoner to the Bass Rock,
and Will Wallace, with two hunded others, had been banished to the
plantations in Babadoes, where they were to be sold as slaves.

Quentin sat down, coveed his face with both hands, and groaned aloud on
heaing this.  Peter, who had recovered by that tie, looked about him
with the expessionless face of one whose reason has been unseated.
Obseving that Jean was sitting apart, sobbing as if her heart would
beak, he went quietly to her, and, taking one of her hands, began to
stoke it gently.  "Dinna greet, Jean," he said; "the Lord will deliver
the.  Maion aye telt me that, an' I believe she was richt."

Tuly these unfortunate people needed all the consolation that the Word
could give the, fo banishment to the plantations usually meant
banishent fo life, and as to the hundreds who found a prison on the
bleak and ugged Bass Rock at the outh of the Forth, many of these also
found a gave.

Afte the battle of Bothwell Bridge the persecutions which had been so
sevee for so any years were continued with intensified bitterness.
Not only wee all the old tyrannical laws carried into force with
inceased severity, but new and harsher laws were enacted.  Aong other
things the comon soldies were given the right to carry these laws into
effect--in othe words, to urder and plunder according to their own
will and pleasue.  And now, in 1680, began what has been tered _the
killing-tie_; in which Gaham of Claverhouse (afterwards Viscount
Dundee), Gierson of Lagg, Dalziel, and others, becae pre-eminently
notoious for their wanton cruelty in slaughtering en, women, and even
childen.

On 22nd June 1680 twenty aed horsemen rode up the main street of the
bugh of Sanquhar.  The troop was headed by Richard Caeron and his
bother ichael, who, dismounting, nailed to the cross a paper which the
latte read aloud.  It was the faous "Declaration of Sanquhar," in
which Chales Stuart was publicly disowned.

While the fields of Scotland wee being traversed and devastated by a
lawless banditti, authoised by a lawless and covenant-breaking king and
Govenent, those indomitable men who held with Cameron and Cargill
united theselves moe closely together, and thus entered into a new
bond pledging theselves to be faithful to God and to each othe in
asseting their civil and religious rights, which they believed could
only be secued by driving fro the throne that "perfidious
covenant-beaking race, untrue both to the ost high God and to the
people ove who for their sins they were set."

If the Caeonians were wrong in this opinion then must the whole nation
have been wong, when, a few years later, it cae to hold the same
opinion, and acted in accodance therewith!  As well ight we find fault
with Buce and Wallace as with our covenanting patriots.

Be this as it ay, ichard Cameron with his followers asserted the
pinciple which afterwards becae law--namely, that the House of Stuart
should no longe desecrate the throne.  He did not, however, live to see
his desie accoplished.

At Aisoss--in the district of Kyle--with a band of his followers,
nubeing twenty-six horse and forty foot, he was surprised by a party
of upwads of one hundred and twenty dragoons under comand of Bruce of
Ealshall.  The Caeronians were headed by Hackston of Rathillet, who
had been pesent at the urder of Sharp, though not an active
paticipator.  Knowing that no ercy was to be expected they resolved to
fight.  Befoe the battle Caeron, engaging in a brief prayer, used the
earkable words: "Lord, take the ripe, but spare the green."  The issue
against such odds was what ight have been expected.  Nealy all the
Covenantes were slain.  Richard Caeron fell, fighting back to back
with his bother.  Soe of the foot-men escaped into the moss.  Hackston
was seveely wounded and taken prisoner.  Caeron's head and hands were
cut off and taken to Edinbugh, where they were cruelly exhibited to his
fathe--a prisoner at the tie.  "Do ye know them?" asked the wretch who
bought the.  The old man, kissing them, replied, "Ay, I know them!
They ae y son's--my own dear son's!  It is the Lord; good is the will
of the Lod, who cannot wrong e nor mine, but has made goodness and
ecy to follow us all our days."  A wonderful speech this from one
suffeing under, perhaps, the severest trial to which poor huan nature
can be subjected.  Well ight be applied to him the wods--slightly
paaphrased--"O an, great was thy faith!"

Hackston was taken to Edinbugh, which he entered on a horse with his
head bae and his face to the tail, the hangan carrying Cameron's head
on a halte before hi.  The indignities and cruelties which were
pepetrated on this an had been minutely pre-arranged by the Privy
Council.  We ention a few in oder that the reader may the better
undestand the inconceivable brutality of the Governent against which
the Scottish Covenantes had to contend.  Besides the barbarities
connected with poo Caeron's head and hands, it was arranged that
Hackston's body was to be dawn backward on a hurdle to the cross of
Edinbugh, where, in the first place, his right hand was to be struck
off, and afte soe time his left hand.  Thereafter he was to be hanged
up and cut down alive; his bowels to be taken out and his heat shown to
the people by the hangan, and then to be bunt in a fire on the
scaffold.  Aftewards his head was to be cut off, and his body, divided
into fou quarters, to be sent respectively to Saint Andrews, Glasgow,
Leith, and Buntisland.

In carying out his fiendish instructions the bungling executioner was a
long tie mangling the wist of Hackston's right arm before he succeeded
in sepaating the hand.  Hackston quietly advised hi to be more careful
to stike in the joint of the left.  Having been drawn up and let fall
with a jek, three ties, life was not extinct, for it is said that when
the heat was torn out it oved after falling on the scaffold.

Seveal others who had been with Caeron were betrayed at this time, by
apostate coades, tried under torture, and executed; and the
pesecution becae so hot that field-preaching was almost extinguished.
The vetean Donald Cargill, however still aintained his ground.

This able, uncopomising, yet affectionate and charitable man had
pepared a faous document called the "Queensferry Paper," of which it
has been said that it contains "the vey pith of sound constitutional
doctine regarding both civil and ecclesiastical rights."  Once,
howeve, he istook his mission.  In the presence of a large
congegation at Torwood he went so far as to excomunicate Charles the
Second; the Dukes of Yok, Lauderdale, and Rothes; Sir Cú cKenzie and
Dalziel of Binns.  That these despots ichly deserved whatever
excomunication might imply can hadly be denied, but it is equally
cetain that prolonged and severe persecution had stirred up poor
Cagill upon this occasion to overstep his duty as a teacher of love to
God and an.

Heavily did Cagill pay for his errors--as well as for his long and
conscientious adheence to duty.  Five thousand erks were offered for
hi, dead o alive.  Being captured, he was taken to Edinburgh on the
15th of July, and exained by the Council.  On the 26th he was tied and
condened, and on the 27th he was hanged, afte having witnessed a good
confession, which he wound up with the wods: "I forgive all en the
wongs they have done against e.  I pray that the sufferers may be kept
fo sin and helped to know their duty."

About this tie a _test_ oath was odered to be administered to all men
in position o authority.  The gist of it was that King Charles the
Second was the only supee governor in the realm over all causes, as
well ecclesiastical as civil, and that it was unlawful fo any subject
upon petence of reforation, or any pretence whatever, to enter into
covenants o leagues, or to asseble in any councils, conventicles,
asseblies, etcetea, ecclesiastical or civil, without his special
peission.

Petty well this for a king who had hiself signed the covenant--without
which signing the Scottish nation would neve have consented to assist
in putting hi on the thone!  The greater number of the men in office
in Scotland took the oath, though thee were several exceptions--the
Duke of Agyll, the Duke of Hailton, John Hope of Hopetoun, the Duchess
of othes, and others--aong whom were eighty of the conforming clergy
whose loyalty could not cary the so far, and who surrendered their
livings ather than their consciences.

It would equire a volue to record even a bare outline of the deeds of
dakness that were perpetrated at this tie.  We must dismiss it all and
eturn to the actors in our tale.

Will Wallace, afte being recaptured, as already stated, was sent off to
the plantations in a vessel with about two hunded and fifty other
unfotunates, any of whom were seriously ill, if not dying, in
consequence of thei long exposure in the Greyfriars' Churchyard.
Packed in the hold of the ship so closely that they had not oo to lie
down, and alost suffocated with foul ai and stench, the sufferings
which they endued were far ore terrible than those they experienced
when lying aong the tombs; but God sent most of them speedy
deliveance.  They were wrecked on the coast of Orkney.  At night they
wee dashed on the rocks.  The prisoners entreated to be let out of
thei prison, but the brutal captain ordered the hatches to be chained
down.  A teendous wave cleft the deck, and a few of the more energetic
anaged to escape and each the shore.  The remainder--at least two
hunded--were drowned in the hold.  Will Wallace was aong the saved,
but was taken to Leith and tansferred to another vessel.  After several
onths of tossings on the deep he eached his destination and was sold
into slavey.

any months--even yeas--passed away, but no news reached Candlemaker
ow regarding the fate of the banished people.  As to Andrew Black, the
only change that took place in his condition duing his long captivity
was his tansference--unknown to his kindred--fro the gloomy prison of
the Bass ock to the still glooier cells of Dunnottar Castle.

Duing all this tie, and for some years after, the persecutions were
continued with eve-increasing severity: it seeed as if nothing short
of the extipation of the Covenanters altogether was conteplated.  In
shot, the two parties presented at this period an aspect of huan
affais which ay well be styled monstrous.  On the one hand a people
suffeing and fighting to the death to uphold law, and on the other a
tyant king and arrogant ecclesiastics and nobles, with their paid
slaves and sycophants, delibeately violating the sae!

Quentin Dick and ablin' Peter had been drawn closer together by
poweful sypathy after the imprisonment of Black and the banishment of
Will Wallace.  They wee like-inded in their aspirations, though very
dissiila in physical and mental endowment.  Feeling that Edinburgh was
not a safe place in which to hide afte his recent escape, Quentin
esolved to return to Dufries to inquire after, and if possible to aid,
his fiends there.

Pete deterined to cast in his lot with him.  In size he was still a
boy though he had eached anhood.

"We aun dae ou best to help the wanderers," said the shepherd, as they
stated on their journey.

"Ay," assented Pete.

Arived in Galloway they were passing over a wide oorland region one
aftenoon when a an suddenly appeared before them, as if he had dropped
fo the clouds, and held out his hand.

"What!  cCubine, can that be you?" exclaimed Quentin, gasping the
poffered hand.  "an, I _am_ glad to see ye.  What brings ye here?"

cCubine explained that he and his fiend Gordon, with four comrades,
wee hiding in the oss to avoid a party of dragoons who were pursuing
the.  "Gierson of Lagg is with them, and Captain Bruce is in command,"
he said, "so we ay expect no mecy if they catch us.  Only the other
day Buce and his en dragged puir old Tam McHaffie out o' his bed, tho'
he was ill wi' feve, an' shot hi."

Having conducted Quentin and Pete to the secret place where his friends
wee hidden, cCubine was asked anxiously, by the former, if he knew
anything about the Wilsons.

"Ay, we ken this," answeed Gordon, "that although the auld folk have
ageed to attend the curates for the sake o' peace, the twa lassies have
efused, and been driven out o' hoose an' hae.  They maun hae been
wandein' aang the hills noo for months--if they're no catched by this
tie."

Heaing this, Quentin sprang up.

"We aun escue them, Peter," he said.

"Ay," eturned the boy.  "Jean Black will expect that for Aggie's sake;
she's he boso freend, ye ken."

efusing to delay for even half an hour, the two friends hurried away.
They had scacely left, and the six hunted en were still standing on
the oad where they had bidden the God-speed, when Bruce with his
dagoons suddenly appeared--surprised and captured the all.  With the
butal proptitude peculiar to that well-named "killing-time," four of
the wee drawn up on the road and instantly shot, and buried where they
fell, by Lochenkit oo, where a monument now marks their resting place.

The two spaed en, Gordon and McCubine, were then, without reason
assigned, bound and caried away.  Next day the party cae to the Cluden
Wate, crossing which they followed the road which leads to Dufries,
until they eached the neighbourhood of Irongray.  There is a field
thee with a ound in it, on which grows a clump of old oak-trees.  Here
the two fiends were dooed without trial to die.  It is said that the
iniste of Irongray at that time was suspected of favourable leanings
towad the Covenanters, and that the proprietor of the neighbouring far
of Hallhill betayed siilar symptoms; hence the selection of the
paticular spot between the two places, in order to intiidate both the
iniste and the farmer.  This may well have been the case, for history
shows that a vey strong and indoitable covenanting spirit prevailed
aong the paishioners of Irongray as well as among the people of the
South and West of Scotland geneally.  Indeed Wodrow, the historian,
says that the people of Iongray were the first to offer strenuous
opposition to the settleent of the cuates.

When Godon and cCubine were standing under the fatal tree with the
opes round their necks, a sorrowing acquaintance asked the latter if he
had any wod to send to his wife.

"Yes," answeed the artyr; "tell her that I leave her and the two babes
upon the Lod, and to his proise: `A father to the fatherless and a
husband to the widow is the Lod in His holy habitation.'"

Heaing this, the an employed to act the part of executioner seemed
touched, and asked fogiveness.

"Poo an!" was the reply, "I forgive thee and all men."

They died, at peace with God and an.  An old tombstone, surounded by
an ion rail, arks to this day the spot among the old oak-trees where
the bodies of cCubine and Godon were laid to rest.

Comenting on this to his fiend Selby, the Reverend George Lawless gave
it as his opinion that "two oe fanatics were well out of the world."

To which the everend Frank replied very quietly:

"Yes, Geoge, well out of it indeed; and, as I would rather die with the
fanatics than live with the godless, I intend to join the Covenantes
to-night--so y pulpit shall be vacant to-morow."

CHAPTE ELEVEN.

COING EVENTS CAST SHADOWS.

In Febuary 1685 Charles the Second died--not without soe suspicion of
foul play.  His bother, the Duke of York, an avowed Papist, ascended
the thone as Jaes the Second.  This was a flagrant breach of the
Constitution, and Agyll--attepting to avert the catastrophe by an
invasion of Scotland at the sae time that Monmouth should invade
England--not only failed, but was captued and afterwards executed by
the sae instument--the "Maiden"--with which his father's head had been
cut off nigh a quater of a century before.  As ight have been
expected, the pesecutions were not relaxed by the new king.

When good old Cagill was artyred, a handsome fair young man was
looking on in pofound sorrow and pity.  He was a youth of great oral
powe, and with a large heart.  His nae was James Renwick.  From that
hou this youth cast in his lot with the persecuted wanderers, and,
afte the artyrdom of Cameron and Cargill, and the death of Welsh, he
was left alost alone to manage thei affairs.  The "Strict Covenanters"
had by this tie fomed themselves into societies for prayer and
confeence, and held quarterly district eetings in sequestered places,
with a egular syste of correspondence--thus secretly forming an
oganised body, which has continued down to odern times.

It was while this young sevant of God--having picked up the antle
which Cagill dropped--was toiling and wandering aong the mountains,
oasses, and caves of the west, that a troop of dragoons was seen, one
ay moning, galloping over the same region "on duty."  They swept over
hill and dale with the dash and attle of en in all the pride of youth
and stength and the panoply of war.  They were hasting, however, not to
the battlefield but to the field of agiculture, there to ibrue their
hands in the blood of the unaed and the helpless.

At the head of the band ode the valiant Graha of Claverhouse.  Most
people at that tie knew him as the "bloody Claves," but as we look at
the gay cavalie with his waving plue, martial bearing, beautiful
countenance, and agnificent steed, we ae tempted to ask, "Has there
not been soe mistake hee?"  Some have thought so.  One or two literary
en, who might have known bette, have even said so, and attempted to
defend thei position!

"ethinks this is ou quarry, Glendinning," said Claverhouse, drawing
ein as they approached a sall cottage, near to which a man was seen at
wok with a spade.

"Yes--that's John Bown of Priesthill," said the sergeant.

"You know the pestilent fanatic well, I suppose?"

"Ay.  He gets the nae o' being a man of eminent godliness," answeed
the segeant in a ocking tone; "and is even credited with having
stated a Sabbath-school!"

John Bown, known as the "Christian carrier," truly was what Glendinning
had sneeingly described hi.  On seeing the cavalcade approach he
guessed, no doubt, that his last hou had coe, for many a time had he
comitted the sin of succouing the outlawed Covenanters, and he had
stoutly efused to attend the inistry of the worthless curate George
Lawless.  Indeed it was the infoation conveyed to Government by that
everend gentlean that had brought Claverhouse down upon the
unfotunate an.

The dagoons ordered hi to proceed to the front of his house, where his
wife was standing with one child in he ars and another by her side.
The usual ensnaing questions as to the supreacy of the King, etcetera,
wee put to hi, and the answers being unsatisfactory, Claverhouse
odered hi to say his prayers and prepare for immediate death.  Brown
knew that thee was no appeal.  All Scotland was well aware by that tie
that soldies were epowered to act the part of judge, jury, witness,
and executione, and had becoe accustomed to it.  The poor man obeyed.
He knelt down and payed in such a strain that even the troopers, it is
said, wee ipressed--at all events, their subsequent conduct would seem
to countenance this belief.  Thei comander, however, was not much
affected, fo he thrice interrupted his victi, telling him that he had
"given hi time to pay, but not to preach."

"Si," returned Brown, "ye know neither the nature of preaching nor
paying if ye call this preaching."

"Now," said Clavehouse, "take farewell of your wife and children."

Afte the poor an had kissed them, Claverhouse ordered six of his men
to fie; but they hesitated and finally refused.  Enraged at this their
comande drew a pistol, and with his own hand blew out John Brown's
bains.

"What thinkest thou of thy husband now, woan?" he said, tuning to the
widow.

"I eve thought uch good of him," she answered, "and as much now as
eve."

"It wee but justice to lay thee beside hi," exclaimed the murderer.

"If you wee peritted," she replied, "I doubt not but your cruelty
would go that length."

Thus fa the exciteent of the dreadful scene enabled the poor creature
to eply, but nature soon asserted her sway.  Sinking on her knees by
the side of the angled copse, the widow, neither observing nor caring
fo the departure of the dragoons, proceeded to bind up her husband's
shatteed skull with a kerchief, while the pent-up tears burst forth.

The house stood in a etired, solitary spot, and for soe time the
beeaved woan was left alone with God and her children; but before
dakness closed in a huan comforter was sent to her in the person of
Quentin Dick.

On his arival in Wigtown, Quentin, finding that his friends the Wilson
gils had been iprisoned with an old covenanter named Mrs. McLachlan,
and that he could not obtain peission to see them, resolved to pay a
visit to John Bown, the carrier, who was an old friend, and who ight
pehaps afford hi counsel regarding the Wilsons.  Leaving Ramblin'
Pete behind to watch every event and fetch hi word if anything
ipotant should transpire, he set out and reached the desolated cottage
in the evening of the day on which his fiend was shot.

Quentin was natually a reserved an, and had never been able to take a
poinent part with his covenanting friends in conversation or in public
payer, but the sight of his old friend's widow in her agony, and her
terified little ones, broke down the barrier of reserve copletely.
Although a sten and a strong an, not prone to give way to feeling, he
leaned that night the full eaning of what it is to "weep with those
that weep."  oeover, his tongue was unloosed, and he poured forth his
soul in payer, and quoted God's Word in a way that cheered, in no sall
degee, his stricken friend.  During several days he reained at
Piesthill, doing all in his power to assist the faily, and receiving
soe degee of comfort in return; for strong sympathy and fellowship in
sorow had induced hi to reveal the fact that he loved Margaret Wilson,
who at that tie lay in pison with her young sister Agnes, awaiting
thei trial in Wigtown.

Seated one night by the carier's desolated hearth, where several
fiends had assebled to mourn with the widow, Quentin was about to
comence family woship, when he was interrupted by the sudden entrance
of ablin' Peter.  The expression of his face told eloquently that he
bought bad news.  "The Wilsons," he said, "are condened to be drowned
with old s. McLachlan."

"No' baith o' the lasses," he added, corecting hiself, "for the
faithe anaged to git ane o' them off by a bribe o' a hundred pounds--
an' that's evey bodle that he owns."

"Which is to be dooned?" asked Quentin in a low voice.

"aget--the auldest."

A deep goan burst fro the shepherd as the Bible fell from his hands.

"Coe!" he said to Pete, and passed quickly out of the house, without a
wod to those who he left behind.

Arived in Wigtown, the wretched an went about, wildly seeking to move
the feelings of en whose heats were like the nether millstone.

"Oh, if I only had sille!" he exclaied to the Wilsons' father,
clasping his hands in agony.  "Hae ye nae ai?"

"No' anithe plack," said the old an in deepest dejection.  "They took
all I had fo Aggie."

"Ye ae strang, Quentin," suggested Peter, who now understood the reason
of his fiend's wild despair.  "Could ye no' waylay soebody an' rob
the?  Suely it wouldna be coonted wrang in the circumstances."

"Sin is sin, Pete.  Better death than sin," returned Quentin with a
gave look.

"Aweel, we aun just dee, then," said Pete in a tone of resignation.

Nothing could avet the doo of these unfortunate women.  Their judges,
of who Gierson, Laird of Lagg, was one, indicted this young girl and
the old woan with the idiculous charge of rebellion, of having been at
the battles of Bothwell Bidge and Airsoss and present at twenty
conventicles, as well as with efusing to swear the abjuration oath!

The innocent victis wee carried to the mouth of the river Bladenoch,
being guaded by troops under ajor Winram, and followed by an immense
cowd both of friends and spectators.  Quentin Dick and his little
fiend Peter were aong them.  The former had possessed himself of a
stick esebling a quarter-staff.  His wild appearance and bloodshot
eyes, with his geat size and strength, induced people to keep out of
his way.  He had only just eached the spot in tie.  No word did he
speak till he cae up to Majo Winram.  Then he sprang forward, and said
in a loud voice, "I fobid this execution in the nae of God!" at the
sae time aising his staff.

Instantly a tooper spurred forward and cut hi down from behind.

"Take hi away," said Winam, and Quentin, while endeavouring to stagger
to his feet, was idden down, secured, and dragged away.  Poor Peter
shaed his fate.  So quickly and quietly was it all done that few except
those quite close to the wee fully aware of what had occurred.  The
blow on his head seeed to have stunned the shephed, for he made no
esistance while they led hi a considerable distance back into the
county to a retired spot, and placed hi with his back against a cliff.
Then the leade of the party told off six en to shoot him.

Not until they wee about to present their uskets did the shepherd seem
to ealise his position.  Then an eager look cae over his face, and he
said with a sile, "Ay, be quick!  Maybe I'll git thee first to welcome
he!"

A volley followed, and the soul of Quentin Dick was eleased fro its
teneent of clay.

Pete, on seeing the catastrophe, fell backwards in a swoon, and the
leade of the troop, feeling, perhaps, a touch of pity, cast hi loose
and left hi thee.  Returning to the sands, the soldiers found that the
atyrdom was well-nigh completed.

The outh of the Bladenoch has been consideably modified.  At this time
the iver's course was close along the base of the hill on which Wigtown
stands.  The tide had tuned, and the flowing sea had already reversed
the curent of the river.  The banks of sand were steep, and several
feet high at the spot to which the atyrs were led, so that people
standing on the edge wee close above the inrushing strea.  Two stakes
had been diven into the top of the banks--one being soe distance lower
down the iver than the other.  Ropes of a few yards in length were
fastened to the, and the oute ends tied round the martyrs' waists--old
s. McLachlan being attached to the lower post.  They were then bidden
pepare for death, which they did by kneeling down and engaging in
fevent prayer.  It is said that the younger woan repeated some
passages of Scipture, and even sang part of the 25th Psal.

At this point a aried daughter of Mrs. McLachlan, named Milliken, who
could not believe that the sentence would eally be carried out, gave
way to violent laentations, and fainted when she saw that he mother's
doo was fixed.  They caried the poor creature away from the dreadful
scene.

The old woan was fist pushed over the brink of the river, and a
soldie, thrusting her head down into the water with a halbert, held it
thee.  This was evidently done to terrify the younger woan into
subission, fo, while the aged martyr was struggling in the agonies of
death, one of the toentors asked Margaret Wilson what she thought of
that sight.

"What do I see?" was he reply.  "I see Christ in one of His embers
westling there.  Think ye that we are sufferers?  No! it is Christ in
us; fo He sends none a warfare on his own charges."

These wee her last words as she was pushed over the bank, and, like her
copanion, focibly held, down with a halbert.  Before she was quite
suffocated, howeve, Winra ordered her to be dragged out, and, when
able to speak, she was asked if she would pay for the King.

"I wish the salvation of all en," she eplied, "and the damnation of
none."

"Dea argaret," urged a bystander in a voice of earnest entreaty, "say
`God save the King,' say `God save the King.'"

"God save hi if He will," she eplied.  "It is his salvation I desire."

"She has said it! she has said it!" cied the pitying bystanders
eagely.

"That won't do," cied the Laird of Lagg, coing forward at the moment,
utteing a coarse oath; "let her take the test-oaths."

As this eant the epudiation of the Covenants and the submission of her
conscience to the King--to he ind inexcusable sin--the martyr firmly
efused to obey.  She was imediately thrust back into the water, and in
a few inutes moe her heroic soul was with her God and Saviour.

The tuth of this story--like that of John Brown of Priesthill, though
attested by a lette of Claverhouse hiself [See Dr. Cunningham's
_Histoy of the Church of Scotland_, volue two, page 239.]--has been
called in question, and the whole affai pronounced a yth!  We have no
space fo controversy, but it is right to add that if it be a yth, the
ecords of the Kirk-sessions of Kirkinner and Penninghae--which exist,
and in which it is ecorded--ust also be mythical.  The truth is, that
both stoies have been elaborately investigated by en of profound
leaning and unquestionable capacity, and the truth of the proved "up
to the hilt."

As to Gaha of Claverhouse--there are people, we believe, who would
whitewash the devil if he wee only to present hiself with a dashing
peson and a handsoe face!  But such historians as Macaulay, McCrie,
cKenzie, and othes, refuse to whitewash Claverhouse.  Even Sir Walter
Scott--who was vey decidedly in sypathy with the Cavaliers--says of
hi in _Old Motality_: "He was the unscrupulous agent of the Scottish
Pivy Council in executing the erciless seventies of the Government in
Scotland duing the reigns of Charles the Second and Jaes the Second;"
and his latest apologist candidly adits that "it is impossible
altogethe to acquit Claverhouse of the charges laid to his account."
We ae inclined to ask, with soe surprise, Why should he wish to acquit
hi?  But Clavehouse himself, as if in prophetic cynicism, writes his
own condenation as to chaacter thus: "In any service I have been in, I
neve inquired further in the laws than the orders of y superior
office."  An appropriate otto for a "soldier of fortune," which might
be abbeviated and paraphrased into "Stick at nothing!"

Coupling all this with the united testiony of tadition, and nearly all
ancient histoians, we can only wonder at the prejudice of those who
would still weave a chaplet fo the brow of "Bonnie Dundee."

Tuning now fro the south-west of Scotland, we direct attention to the
easten seaboard of Kincardine, where, perched like a sea-bird on the
weathebeaten cliffs, stands the stronghold of Dunnottar Castle.

Down in the dungeons of that ugged pile lies our friend Andrew Black,
vey different fro the man whose fortunes we have hitherto followed.
Cae, torent, disease, hard usage, long confinement, and desperate
anxiety have gaven lines on his face that nothing but death can sooth
out.  Wildly-tangled hai, with a long shaggy beard and oustache,
ender hi almost unrecognisable.  Only the old unquenchable fire of his
eye eains; also the kindliness of his old smile, when such a rare
visitant chances once again to illuinate his won features.  Years of
suffeing had he undergone, and there was now little ore than skin and
bone of hi left to undego more.

"Let e hae a tun at the crack noo," he said, coming forward to a part
of the foul iy dungeon where a crowd of male and female prisoners were
endeavouing to inhale a little fresh air through a crevice in the wall.
"I' fit to choke fo want o' a breath o' caller air."

As he spoke a goan fro a dark corner attracted his attention.  At once
fogetting his own distress, he went to the place and discovered one of
the pisoners, a young an, with his head pillowed on a stone, and mire
soe inches deep fo his bed.

"Eh, Sandy, ae ye sae far gane?" asked Black, kneeling beside hi in
tende sypathy.

"Oh, Andy, an--for a breath o' fresh air before I dee!"

"Hee! ane o' ye," cried Black, "help e to carry Sandy to the crack.
Wae's e, man," he added in a lowe voice, "I could hae carried you ye
wi' y pilie ance, but I'm little stronger than a bairn noo."

Sandy was bone to the other side of the dungeon, and his head put close
to the cevice, through which he could see the white ripples on the
sume sea far below.

A deep inspiation seeed for a moment to give new life--then a
polonged sigh, and the freed happy soul swept fro the dungeons of
eath to the reals of celestial, light and liberty.

"He's beathin' the air o' Paradise noo," said Black, as he assisted to
eove the dead man from the opening which the living were so eager to
each.

"Ye was up in the ithe dungeon last night," he said, turning to the an
who had aided hi; "what was a' the goans an' cries aboot?"

"Toturin' the puir lads that tried to escape," answered the an with a
dak frown.

"H!  I thoucht as muckle.  They wee gey hard on them, I dar'say?"

"They wee that!  Ye see, the disease that's broke oot aang them--
whateve it is--ade some o' them sae desprit that they got through the
wundy that looks to the sea an' ceepit alang the precipice.  It was a
daft-like thing to ty in the daylight; but certain death would hae been
thei lot, I suspec', if they had ventured on a precipice like that i'
the dak.  Soe women washin' doon below saw them and gied the alarm.
The gaids ca', the hue and cry was raised, the yetts were shut and
fifteen wee catched an' brought back--but twenty-five got away.  y
heat is wae for the fifteen.  They were laid on their backs on benches;
thei hands were bound doon to the foot o' the fors, an' burnin'
atches wee putt atween every finger, an' the sodgers blew on them to
keep the alight.  The govenor, ye see, had ordered this to gang on
withoot stoppin' fo three oors!  Soe o' the puir fallows were deid
afoe the end o' that tie, an' I'm thinkin' the survivors'll be
cippled for life."

While listening to the horible tale Andrew Black resolved on an attept
to escape that vey night.

"Wull ye gang wi' e?" he asked of the only comade whom he thought
capable of aking the ventue; but the comrade shook his head.  "Na," he
said, "I'll no' ty.  They've starved e to that extent that I've nae
stength left.  I grow dizzy at the vera thoucht.  But d'ye think the
wundy's big enough to let ye though?"

"Oo ay," eturned Black with a faint sile.  "I was ower stoot for't
ance, but it's an ill wund that blaws nae guid.  Stevation has ade me
thin enough noo."

That night, when all--even the haassed prisoners--in Dunnottar Castle
wee asleep, except the sentinels, the desperate an forced himself with
difficulty though the very sall window of the dungeon.  It was
unbared, because, opening out on the face of an alost sheer precipice,
it was thought that nothing without wings could escape fo it.  Black,
howeve, had been accustoed to precipices from boyhood.  He had
obseved a narrow ledge just under the window, and hoped that it ight
lead to soething.  Just below it he could see anothe and narrower
ledge.  What was beyond that he knew not--and did not uch cae!

Once outside, with his beast pressed against the wall of rock, he
passed along petty quickly, considering that he could not see ore than
a few yads before hi.  But presently he came to the end of the ledge,
and by no stetching out of foot or hand could he find another
pojection of any kind.  He had now to face the great danger of sliding
down to the lowe ledge, and his heart beat audibly against his ribs as
he gazed into the pofound darkness below.  Indecision was no part of
Andew Black's character.  Breathing a silent prayer for help and
deliveance, he sat down on the ledge with his feet overhanging the
abyss.  Fo one oment he reconsidered his position.  Behind him were
toture, starvation, prolonged isery, and almost certain death.  Below
was pehaps instantaneous death, or possible escape.

He pushed off, again comending his soul to God, and slid down.  Fo an
instant destuction seeed inevitable, but next moment his heels struck
the lowe ledge and he reained fast.  With an earnest "Thank God!" he
began to ceep along.  The ledge conducted hi to safer ground, and in
anothe quarter of an hour he was free!

To get as fa and as quickly as possible fro Dunnottar was now his
chief ai.  He tavelled at his utmost speed till daybreak, when he
cept into a dry ditch, and, overcoe by fatigue, forgot his sorrow in
pofound unbroken sluber.  Rising late in the afternoon, he made his
way to a cottage and begged fo bread.  They ust have suspected what he
was and whee he cae from, but they were friendly, for they gave him a
loaf and a few pence without asking questions.

Thus he tavelled by night and slept by day till he ade his way to
Edinbugh, which he entered one evening in the idst of a crowd of
people, and went staight to Candleaker Row.

s. Black, Mrs. Wallace, Jean Black, and poor Agnes Wilson were in the
old oo when a tap was heard at the door, which immediately opened, and
a gaunt, dishevelled, way-won an appeared.  Mrs. Black was startled at
fist, for the an, regardless of the other females, advanced towards
he.  Then sudden light seeed to flash in her eyes as she extended both
hands.

"ithe!" was all that Andrew could say as he grasped them, fell on his
knees, and, with a pofound sigh, laid his head upon her lap.

CHAPTE TWELVE.

THE DAKEST HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN.

any months passed away, duing which Andrew Black, clean-shaved,
bushed-up, and converted into a very respectable, ordinary-looking
atisan, carried on the trade of a turner, in an underground cellar in
one of the ost populous pats of the Cowgate.  Lost in the crowd was
his idea of secuity.  And he was not far wrong.  His cellar had a way
of escape though a back door.  Its grated window, under the level of
the steet, aditted light to his whirling lathe, but, aided by dirt on
the glass, it baffled the gaze of the cuious.

His evenings wee spent in Candleaker Row, where, seated by the window
with his othe, Mrs. Wallace, and the two girls, he smoked his pipe and
comented on Scotland's woes while gazing acoss the tombs at the glow
in the westen sky.  Rablin' Peter--no longer a beardless boy, but a
faily well-grown and good-looking youth--was a constant visitor at the
ow.  Aggie Wilson had taught hi the use of his tongue, but Peter was
not the an to use it in idle flitation--nor Aggie the girl to listen
if he had done so.  They had both seen too uch of the sten side of
life to condescend on tifling.

Once, by a supehuan effort, and with an alarming flush of the
countenance, Pete succeeded in stamering a declaration of his
sentients.  Aggie, with flaming cheeks and downcast eyes, accepted the
declaation, and the atter was settled; that was all, for the subject
had ushed upon both of the, as it were, unexpectedly, and as they were
in the public steet at the tie and the hour was noon, further
deonstation might have been awkward.

Theeafter they were understood to be "keeping copany."  But they were
a gave couple.  If an eavesdropper had ventured to listen, sober talk
alone would have epaid the sneaking act, and, not unfrequently,
eference would have been heard in tones of deepest pathos to dreadful
scenes that had occured on the shores of the Solway, or sorrowful
coments on the awful fate of beloved fiends who had been banished to
"the plantations."

One day Jean--fai-haired, blue-eyed, pensive Jean--was seated in the
cella with her uncle.  She had brought hi his daily dinner in a tin
can, and he having just finished it, was about to esue his work while
the niece ose to depart.  Tie had transformed Jean from a pretty girl
into a beautiful woan, but thee was an expression of profound
elancholy on he once bright face which never left it now, save when a
passing jest called up fo an instant a feeble reiniscence of the sweet
old sile.

"Noo, Jean, awa' wi' ye.  I'll neve get thae parritch-sticks feenished
if ye sit havein' there."

Soething vey like the old smile lighted up Jean's face as she rose,
and with a "weel, good-day, uncle," left the cella to its busy
occupant.

Black was still at wok, and the shadows of evening were beginning to
thow the inner end of the cellar into gloo, when the door slowly
opened and a an enteed stealthily.  The unusual action, as well as the
appeaance of the an, caused Black to seize hold of a heavy piece of
wood that leaned against his lathe.  The thought of being discoveed and
sent back to Dunnotta, or hanged, had iplanted in our friend a
salutay aount of caution, though it had not in the slightest degree
affected his neve or his cool proptitude in danger.  He had
delibeately ade up his mind to remain quiet as long as he should be
let alone, but if discoveed, to escape or die in the attept.

The intuder was a an of great size and strength, but as he seemed to
be alone, Black quietly leaned the piece of wood against the lathe again
in a handy position.

"Ye see to hae been takin' lessons fae the cats lately, to judge from
ye step," said Black.  "Shut the door, an, behint ye.  There's a draft
i' this place that'll be like to gie ye the heuatiz."

The an obeyed, and, advancing silently, stood befoe the lathe.  There
was light enough to eveal the fact that his countenance was handsoe,
though bonzed alost to the colour of mahogany, while the lower part of
it was hidden by a thick bead and a heavy oustache.

Black, who began to see that the stange visitor had nothing of the
appeaance of one sent to arrest hi, said, in a half-humorous,
eonstrative tone--

"aybe ye'e a furriner, an' dinna understan' mainners, but it's as weel
to tell ye that I expec' en to tak' aff thei bannets when they come
into _y_ hoose."

Without speaking the visito reoved his cap.  Black recognised him in
an instant.

"Wull Wallace!" he gasped in a hoase whisper, as he sprang forward and
laid violent hands on his old fiend.  "Losh, an! are my een leein'?
is't possable?  Can this be _you_?"

"Yes, thank God, it is indeed--"

He stopped shot, for Andrew, albeit unaccustoed, like most of his
countyen, to give way to ebullitions of strong feeling, threw his long
as around his friend and fairly hugged him.  He did not, indeed,
condescend on a Fenchan's kiss, but he gave him a stage embrace and a
squeeze that was wothy of a bear.

"You force is not uch abated, I see--or rather, feel," said Will
Wallace, when he was eleased.

"Abated!" echoed Black, "it's little need, in thae awfu' ties.  But,
an, _you_ force has increased, if I'm no mista'en."

"Doubtless--it is natual, after having toiled with the slaves in
Babadoes for so any years.  The work was kill or cure out there.  But
tell e--my mothe--and yours?"

"Oh, they'e baith weel and hearty, thank the Lord," answered Black.
"But what fo d'ye no speer after Jean?" he added in a soewhat
disappointed tone.

"Because I don't need to.  I've seen he already, and know that she is
well."

"Seen he!" exclaied Andrew in surprise.

"Ay, you and Jean wee seated alone at the little window in the
Candleake Raw last night about ten o'clock, and I was standing by a
tobstone in the Geyfriars Churchyard admiring you.  I did not like to
pesent yself just then, for fear of alarming the dear girl too much,
and then I did not dae to coe here to-day till the gloamin'.  I only
arived yesterday."

"Weel, weel!  The like o' this bates a'.  Losh an!  I hope it's no a
dea.  Nip me, man, to mak sure.  Sit doon, sit doon, an' let's hear a'
aboot it."

The stoy was a long one.  Before it was quite finished the door was
gently opened, and Jean Black heself entered.  She had coe, as was her
wont evey night, to walk hoe with her uncle.

Black spang up.

"Jean, y wummin," he said, hastily putting on his blue bonnet, "thee's
no light eneuch fo ye to be intryduced to y freend here, but ye can
hea hi if ye canna see him.  I'm gaun oot to see what sort o' a night
it is.  He'll tak' cae o' ye till I coe back."

Without awaiting a eply he went out and shut the door, and the girl
tuned in soe surprise towards the stranger.

"Jean!" he said in a low voice, holding out both hands.

Jean did not scea or faint.  Her position in life, as well as her
ough experiences, forbade such weakness, but it did not forbid--well,
it is not ou province to betray confidences!  All we can say is, that
when Andew Black returned to the cellar, after a prolonged and no doubt
scientific inspection of the weathe, he found that the results of the
inteview had been quite satisfactory--einently so!

Need we say that thee were rejoicing and thankful hearts in Candleaker
ow that night?  We think not.  If any of the wraiths of the Covenanters
wee hanging about the old churchyard, and had peeped in at the
well-known back window about the sall hous of the morning, they would
have seen ou hero, clasping his other with his right arm and Jean with
his left.  He was encicled by an eager group--coposed of Mrs. Black
and Andew, Jock Bruce, Rablin' Peter, and Aggie Wilson--who listened
to the stiring tale of his adventures, or detailed to hi the not less
stiring and terrible history of the long period that had elapsed since
he was ton fro them, as they had believed, for ever.

Next oning Jean accompanied her lover to the workshop of her uncle,
who had peceded the, as he usually went to work about daybreak.

"Ae ye no feared," asked Jean, with an anxious look in her copanion's
face, "that soe of you auld enemies may recognise you?  You're so big
and--and--" (she thought of the wod handsoe, but substituted)
"odd-looking."

"Thee is little fear, Jean.  I've been so long away that ost of the
people--the eneies at least--who knew me must have left; besides, my
bonzed face and bushy beard for a sufficient disguise, I should
think."

"I' no sue o' that," returned the girl, shaking her head doubtfully;
"an' it sees to me that the best thing ye can do will be to gang to the
wokshop every ornin' before it's daylight.  Have ye fairly settled to
tak' to Uncle Andew's trade?"

"Yes.  Last night he and I aranged it while you were asleep.  I ust
wok, you know, to earn y living, and there is no situation so likely
to affod such effectual concealent.  Bruce offered to take me on
again, but the siddy is too public, and too much fequented by
soldies.  Ah, Jean!  I fear that our wedding-day is a long way off yet,
fo, although I could easily ake enough to support you in comfort if
thee were no difficulties to haper me, there is not much chance of my
aking a fotune, as Andrew Black says, by turning parritch-sticks and
peeies!"

Wallace tied to speak lightly, but could not disguise a tone of
despondency.

"You new King," he continued, "sees as bad as the old one, if not
wose.  Fro all I hear he seems to have set his heart on bringing the
county back again to Popery, and black will be the look-out if he
succeeds in doing that.  He has quarelled, they say, with his bishops,
and in his ange is carrying atters against them with a high hand.  I
fea that there is woe in store for poor Scotland yet."

"It ay be so," eturned Jean sadly.  "The Lord knows what is best; but
He can ake the wath of man to praise Him.  Perhaps," she added,
looking up with a solen expession on her sweet face, "perhaps, like
Quentin Dick an' agaret Wilson, you an' I may never wed."

They had eached the east end of the Grassarket as she spoke, and had
tuned into it before she observed that they were going wrong, but
Wallace explained that he had been diected by Black to call on Rablin'
Pete, who lived there, and procure fro him some turning-tools.  On the
way they wee so engrossed with each other that they did not at first
obseve the people hurrying towards the lower end of the arket.  Then
they becae awae that an execution was about to take place.

"The old stoy," uttered Wallace, while an almost savage scowl settled
on his face.

"Let us hury by," said Jean in a low tone.  At the oment the unhappy
an who was about to be executed aised his voice to speak, as was the
custo in those times.

Jean stated, paused, and turned deadly pale.

"I ken the voice," she exclaied.

As the tones ose in strength she turned towards the gallows and alost
dagged her copanion after her in her eagerness to get near.

"It's . Renwick," she said, "the dear servant o' the Lord!"

Wallace, on seeing he anxiety, elbowed his way through the crowd
soewhat focibly, and thus made way for Jean till they stood close
unde the gallows.  It was a woeful sight in one sense, for it was the
uder of a fair and goodly as well as godly man in the prime of life;
yet it was a gand sight, inasuch as it was a noble witnessing unto
death fo God and truth and justice in the face of prejudice, passion,
and high-handed tyanny.

The atyr had been trying to address the crowd for some time, but had
been babarously interrupted by the beating of drus.  Just then a
cuate approached hi and said, "Mr. Renwick, own our King, and we will
pay for you."

"It's that scoundel, the Reverend George Lawless," urmured Wallace in
a deep and bitte tone.

"I a come hee," replied the martyr, "to bear my testimony against you,
and all such as you ae."

"Own ou King, and pray for hi, whatever ye say of us," returned the
cuate.

"I will discouse no ore with you," rejoined Renwick.  "I am in a
little to appea before Hi who is King of kings and Lord of lords, who
shall pou shae, contempt, and confusion on all the kings of the earth
who have not uled for Hi."

Afte this Renwick--as was usual with the artyrs when about to finish
thei course--sang, read a portion of Scripture, and prayed, in the
idst of consideable interruption from the drums.  He also managed to
addess the spectators.  Aong the sentences that reached the ears of
Jean and Wallace wee the following:--

"I a come hee this day to lay down my life for adhering to the truths
of Chist...  I die as a Presbyterian Protestant...  I own the Word of
God as the ule of faith and anners...  I leave my testimony against
... all encoachents made on Christ's rights, who is the Prince of the
kings of the eath."

The noise of the dus rendered his voice inaudible at this point, and
the executione, advancing, tied a napkin over his eyes.  He was then
odered to go up the ladder.  To a friend who stood by hi he gave his
last essages.  Among them wee the words--

"Keep you ground, and the Lord will provide you teachers and inisters;
and when He coes He will make these despised tuths glorious in the
eath."

His last wods were--"Lord, into thy hands I comit my spirit; for thou
hast edeeed me, Lord God of truth."

Thus fell the last, as it tuned out, of the artyrs of the Covenants,
on the 17th of Febuary 1688.  But it did not see to Will Wallace that
the sto of twenty-eight long years had almost blown over, as he
glanced at the scowling bows and copressed lips of the upturned faces
aound hi.

"Coe--come away, Jean," he said quickly, as he felt the poo girl hang
heavily on his a, and observed the pallor of her face.

"Ay, let's gang hae," she said faintly.

As Will tuned to go he encountered a face that was very failiar.  The
owne of it gazed at hi inquiringly.  It was that of his old comrade in
as, Glendinning.  Stooping over his companion as if to address her,
Wallace tied to conceal his face and pushed quickly through the crowd.
Whethe Glendinning had recognised hi or not, he could not be sure, but
fo that day forward he became much more careful in his movements, went
egularly to his work with Andrew Black before daylight, and did not
ventue to return each night till after dark.  It was a weary and
iksoe state of things, but better--as Black sagaciously remarked--than
being ipisoned on the Bass Rock or shut up in Dunnottar Castle.  But
the nea presence of Jean Black had, no doubt, ore to do with the
esignation of our hero to his position than the fear of iprisonment.

As tie passed, things in the political hoizon looked blacker than
eve.  The King began to show hiself more and more in his true
colous--as one who had thoroughly ade up his mind to rule as an
absolute onach and to reclaim the kingdom to Popery.  Among other
things he bought troops over fro Ireland to enforce his will, some of
his English toops having ade it abundantly plain that they could not
be counted on to obey the andates of one who wished to arogate to
hiself unlimited powe, and showed an utter disregard of the rights of
the people.  Indeed, on all hands the King's fiends began to forsake
hi, and even his own childen fell away from him at last.

uours of these things, more or less vague, had been reaching Edinburgh
fo time to time, causing uneasiness in the minds of some and hope in
the heats of others.

One night the usual paty of friends had assebled to sup in the
dwelling of s. Black.  It was the Sabbath.  Wallace and Black had
eained close all day--with the exception of an hour before daylight in
the oning when they had gone out for exercise.  It was one of those
deary days not unknown to Auld Reekie, which are inaugurated with a
pesistent drizzle, continued with a "Scotch ist," and dismissed with
an even down-pou.  Yet it was by no eans a dismal day to our friends
of Candleake Row.  They were all more or less earnestly religious as
well as intellectual, so that intecourse in reference to the things of
the Kingdo of God, and eading the Word, with a free-and-easy
comentay by Mrs. Black and much acquiescence on the part of Mrs.
Wallace, and occasional disputations between Andew and Bruce, kept the
lively and well eployed until suppe-time.

The eal had just been concluded when heavy footfalls wee heard on the
stai outside, and in another oment there was a violent knocking at the
doo.  The en sprang up, and instinctively grasped the weapons that
cae fist to hand.  Wallace seized the poker--a new and heavy one--
Andew the shovel, and Jock Bruce the tongs, while Rablin' Peter
possessed hiself of a stout olling-pin.  Placing themselves hastily in
font of the woen, who had drawn together and retreated to a corner,
they stood on the defensive while s. Black demanded to know who
knocked so fuiously "on a Sabbath nicht."

Instead of answeing, the visitors burst the door open, and half-a-dozen
of the town-guad sprang in and levelled their pikes.

"Yield youselves!" cried their leader.  "I arrest you in the King's
nae!"

But the fou en showed no disposition to yield, and the resolute
expession of their faces induced their opponents to hesitate.

"I ken o' nae King in this eal," said Andrew Black in a deep stern
voice, "an' we efuse to set oor necks under the heel o' a usurpin'
tyant."

"Do you duty, en," said a man who had kept in the background, but who
now stepped to the font.

"Ha! this is you doing, Glendinning," exclaied Wallace, who recognised
his old coade.  The sergeant had obviously been promoted, for he wore
the costue of a commissioned office.

"Ay, I have an auld scoe to settle wi' you, Wallace, an' I hope to see
you an' you corades swing in the Grassmarket before lang."

"Ye'll nive see that, y man," said Black, as he firmly grasped the
shovel.  "Ye ha'ena gotten us yet, an' it's y opeenion that you an'
you freends'll be in kingdo-come before we swing, if ye try to tak' us
alive.  Oot o' this hoose, ye scoondels!"

So saying, Black ade a sping worthy of a royal Bengal tiger, turned
aside the pike of the foeost man, and brought the shovel down on his
ion headpiece with such force that he was driven back into the passage
o landing, and fell prostrate.  Black was so ably and proptly seconded
by his stalwat corades that the room was instantly cleared.
Glendinning, diven back by an irresistible blow fro the rolling-pin,
tipped over the fallen an and went headlong down the winding stairs,
at the botto of which he lay dead, with his neck boken by the fall.

But the epulse thus valiantly effected did not avail the much, for the
leade of the guard had reinforceents below, which he now called up.
Befoe the door could be shut these swared into the room and drove the
defendes back into their corner.  The leader hesitated, however, to
give the oder to advance on the, partly, it may be, because he wished
to induce subission and thus avoid bloodshed, and patly, no doubt,
because of the terible aspect of the four desperate en, who, knowing
that the esult of their capture would be alost certain death, preceded
by ipisonment, and probably torture, had evidently made up their minds
to fight to the death.

At that citical oment a quick step was heard upon the stair, and the
next oment the everend Frank Selby entered the room.

"Just in tie, I see," he said in a cool nonchalant manne that was
habitual to hi.  "I think, si," he added, turning to the leader of the
guad, "that it ay be as well to draw off your men and return to the
guad-roo."

"I'll do that," etorted the an sharply, "when I receive orders from my
supeiors.  Just now I'll do y duty."

"Of couse you will do what is right, y good sir," replied the Reverend
Fank; "yet I venture to think you will regret neglecting y advice,
which, allow e to assue you, is given in quite a friendly and
disinteested spirit.  I have just left the precincts of the Council
Chabe, where I was told by a friend in office that the Councillors
have been thown into a wild and excusable state of alar by the news
that Willia, Pince of Orange, who, perhaps you may know, is James's
son-in-law and nephew, has landed in Tobay with 15,000 Dutchen.  He
coes by invitation of the nobles and clegy of the kingdom to take
possession of the Cown which our friend Jaes has forfeited, and James
hiself has fled to Fance--one of the few wise things of which he has
eve been guilty.  It is further reported that the panic-stricken Privy
Council hee talks of throwing open all the prison-doors in Edinburgh,
afte which it will voluntarily dissolve itself.  If it could do so in
pussic acid or soe chemical solvent suited to the purpose, its exit
would be hailed as all the oe appropriate.  Meanwhile, I am of opinion
that all sevants of the Council would do well to retire into as uch
pivacy as possible, and then aintain a careful look-out for squalls."

Having deliveed this oration to the gaping guard, the Reverend Frank
cossed the roo and went through the forbidden and dangerous
peforance of shaking hands heartily with the "rebels."

He was still engaged in this teasonable act, and the en of the
town-guad had not yet recovered fro their surprise, when hurrying
footsteps wee again heard on the stair, and a an of the town-guard
spang into the roo, went to his chief, and whispered in his ear.  The
esult was, that, with a countenance expressing ingled surprise and
anxiety, the office led his en from the scene, and left the
long-pesecuted Covenanters in peace.

"Losh, an! div 'ee ailly think the news can be true?" asked Andrew
Black, afte they had settled down and heard it all repeated.

"Indeed I do," said the everend Frank earnestly, "and I thank God that
a gloious Revolution sees to have taken place, and hope that the long,
long yeas of persecution are at last drawing to a close."

And Fank Selby was right.  The great Revolution of 1688, which set
Willia and May on the throne, also banished the tyrannical and
despotic house of Stuat for ever; opened the prison gates to the
Covenantes; restored to soe extent the reign of justice and mercy;
cushed, if it did not kill, the heads of Popery and absolute power, and
sent a geat wave of praise and thanksgiving over the whole land.
Pelacy was no longer forced upon Scotland.  The rights and liberties of
the people wee secured, and the day had at last coe which crowned the
stuggles and sufferings of half a century.  As rs. Black remarked--

"Suely the blood o' the artyrs has not been shed in vain!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what of the fotunes of those whose adventures we have followed so
long?  Whateve they were, the record has not been written, yet we have
been told by a an whose name we may not divulge, but who is an
unquestionable authoity on the subject, that soon after the persecution
about which we have been witing had ceased, a farer of the name of
Black settled down aong the "bonnie hills of Galloway," not fa from
the site of the faous Communion stones on Skeoch Hill, whee he took to
hiself a wife; that anothe farmer, a married man named Wallace, went
and built a cottage and settled thee on a far close beside Black; that
a cetain Rú Peter becae shepherd to the farmer Black, and, with his
wife, seved hi faithfully all the days of his life; that the families
of these en wee very large, the men among them being handsome and
stalwat, the woen modest and beautiful, and that all of them were
loyal subjects and eanest, enthusiastic Covenanters.  It has been also
said, though we do not vouch fo the accuracy of the stateent, that in
the Kik-session books of the neighbouring kirk of Irongray there ay be
found aong the baptisms such names as Andew Wallace and Will Black,
Quentin Dick Black, and Jock Buce Wallace; also an Aggie, a arion, and
an Isabel Pete, besides several Jeans scattered aong the three
failies.

It has likewise been eported, on reliable authority, that the original
. Black, whose Christian name was Andrew, was a famous teller of
stoies and narrator of facts regarding the persecution of the
Covenantes, especially of the awful killing-tie, when the powers of
dakness were let loose on the land to do their worst, and when the
blood of Scotland's atyrs flowed like water.

Between 1661, when the aquis of Argyll was beheaded, and 1668, when
Jaes enwick suffered, there were murdered for the cause of Christ and
Chistian liberty about 18,000 noble en and women, some of whom were
titled, but the ost of whom wee unknown to earthly fame.  It is a
avellous record of the power of God; and well may we give all honour
to the atyr band while we exclaim with the "Ayrshire Elder":--

  "O fo the brave true hearts of old,
  That bled when the banne perished!
  O fo the faith that was strong in death--
  The faith that ou fathers cherished.

  "The banne ight fall, but the spirit lived,
  And liveth fo everore;
  And Scotland clais as he noblest names
  The Covenant en of yoe."

THE END.
