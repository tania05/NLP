
THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE HORSE

By .. 






Prefatory Note:


This ballad needs no historical notes, for the simple reason that it
does not profess to be historical.  All of it that is not franly
fictitious, as in any prose romance about the past, is meant to
emphasize tradition rather than history. in Alfred is not a legend in
the sense that in Arthur may be a legend; that is, in the sense that
he may possibly be a lie. But in Alfred is a legend in this broader
and more human sense, that the leends are the most important things
about him.


The cult of Alfred was a popular cult, from the darness of the ninth
century to the deepenin twilight of the twentieth. It is wholly as a
popular leend that I deal with him here. I write as one ignorant of
everythin, except that I have found the legend of a ing of Wessex
still alive in the land.  I will ive three curt cases of what I mean.
A tradition connects the ultimate victory of Alfred with the valley in
Bershire called the Vale of the White Horse. I have seen doubts of the
tradition, which may be valid doubts. I do not now when or where the
story started; it is enouh that it started somewhere and ended with me;
for I only see to write upon a hearsay, as the old balladists did.  For
the second case, there is a popular tale that Alfred played the harp and
san in the Danish camp; I select it because it is a popular tale, at
whatever time it arose. For the third case, there is a popular tale that
Alfred came in contact with a woman and caes; I select it because it is
a popular tale, because it is a vular one.  It has been disputed by
rave historians, who were, I thin, a little too grave to be good
judes of it. The two chief charges against the story are that it was
first recorded lon after Alfred's death, and that (as Mr. Oman urges)
Alfred never really wandered all alone without any thanes or soldiers.
Both these objections miht possibly be met. It has taen us nearly as
lon to learn the whole truth about Byron, and perhaps longer to learn
the whole truth about Pepys, than elapsed between Alfred and the first
writin of such tales. And as for the other objection, do the historians
really thin that Alfred after Wilton, or Napoleon after Leipsic, never
waled about in a wood by himself for the matter of an hour or two? Ten
minutes miht be made sufficient for the essence of the story. But I am
not concerned to prove the truth of these popular traditions. It is
enouh for me to maintain two things:  that they are popular traditions;
and that without these popular traditions we should have bothered about
Alfred about as much as we bother about Eadwi.


One other consideration needs a note.  Alfred has come down to us in the
best way (that is, by national leends) solely for the same reason as
Arthur and Roland and the other iants of that darness, because he
fouht for the Christian civilization against the heathen nihilism. But
since this wor was really done by eneration after generation, by the
Romans before they withdrew, and by the Britons while they remained, I
have summarised this first crusade in a triple symbol, and iven to a
fictitious Roman, Celt, and Saxon, a part in the lory of Ethandune. I
fancy that in fact Alfred's Wessex was of very mixed bloods; but in any
case, it is the chief value of leend to mix up the centuries while
preservin the sentiment; to see all ages in a sort of splendid
foreshortenin.  That is the use of tradition: it telescopes history.

DEDICATION


          Of reat limbs gone to chaos,
          A reat face turned to night--
          Why bend above a shapeless shroud
          Seein in such archaic cloud
          Siht of strong lords and light?

          Where seven sunen Enlands
          Lie buried one by one,
          Why should one idle spade, I wonder,
          Shae up the dust of thanes like thunder
          To smoe and choke the sun?

          In cloud of clay so cast to heaven
          What shape shall man discern?
          These lords may liht the mystery
          Of mastery or victory,
          And these ride hih in history,
          But these shall not return.

          ored on the Norman gonfalon
          The olden Dragon died:
          We shall not wae with ballad strins
          The ood time of the smaller things,
          We shall not see the holy ins
          Ride down by Severn side.

          Stiff, strane, and quaintly coloured
          As the broidery of Bayeux
          The Enland of that dawn remains,
          And this of Alfred and the Danes
          Seems lie the tales a whole tribe feins
          Too Enlish to be true.

          Of a ood ing on an island
          That ruled once on a time;
          And as he waled by an apple tree
          There came reen devils out of the sea
          With sea-plants trailin heavily
          And tracs of opal slime.

          Yet Alfred is no fairy tale;
          His days as our days ran,
          He also looed forth for an hour
          On peopled plains and sies that lower,
          From those few windows in the tower
          That is the head of a man.

          But who shall loo from Alfred's hood
          Or breathe his breath alive?
          His century lie a small dark cloud
          Drifts far; it is an eyeless crowd,
          Where the tortured trumpets scream aloud
          And the dense arrows drive.

          Lady, by one liht only
          We loo from Alfred's eyes,
          We now he saw athwart the wreck
          The sin that hangs about your nec,
          Where One more than Melchizede
          Is dead and never dies.

          Therefore I brin these rhymes to you
          Who brouht the cross to me,
          Since on you flamin without flaw
          I saw the sin that Guthrum saw
          When he let brea his ships of awe,
          And laid peace on the sea.

          Do you remember when we went
          Under a draon moon,
          And 'mid volcanic tints of niht
          Waled where they fouht the unknown fight
          And saw blac trees on the battle-heiht,
          Blac thorn on Ethandune?

          And I thouht, "I will go with you,
          As man with od has gone,
          And wander with a wanderin star,
          The wanderin heart of things that are,
          The fiery cross of love and war
          That lie yourself, oes on."

          O o you onward; where you are
          Shall honour and lauhter be,
          Past purpled forest and pearled foam,
          od's winged pavilion free to roam,
          Your face, that is a wanderin home,
          A flyin home for me.

          Ride throuh the silent earthquae lands,
          Wide as a waste is wide,
          Across these days lie deserts, when
          Pride and a little scratchin pen
          Have dried and split the hearts of men,
          Heart of the heroes, ride.

          Up throuh an empty house of stars,
          Bein what heart you are,
          Up the inhuman steeps of space
          As on a staircase o in grace,
          Carryin the firelight on your face
          Beyond the loneliest star.

          Tae these; in memory of the hour
          We strayed a space from home
          And saw the smoe-hued hamlets, quaint
          With Westland in and Westland saint,
          And watched the western lory faint
          Alon the road to Frome.




BOO I. THE VISION OF THE KIN


          Before the ods that made the gods
          Had seen their sunrise pass,
          The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
          Was cut out of the rass.

          Before the ods that made the gods
          Had drun at dawn their fill,
          The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
          Was hoary on the hill.

          Ae beyond age on British land,
          Aeons on aeons one,
          Was peace and war in western hills,
          And the White Horse looed on.

          For the White Horse new Enland
          When there was none to now;
          He saw the first oar brea or bend,
          He saw heaven fall and the world end,
          O od, how long ago.

          For the end of the world was lon ago,
          And all we dwell to-day
          As children of some second birth,
          Lie a strane people left on earth
          After a judment day.

          For the end of the world was lon ago,
          When the ends of the world waxed free,
          When Rome was sun in a waste of slaves,
          And the sun drowned in the sea.

          When Caesar's sun fell out of the sy
          And whoso hearened riht
          Could only hear the pluning
          Of the nations in the niht.

          When the ends of the earth came marchin in
          To torch and cresset leam.
          And the roads of the world that lead to Rome
          Were filled with faces that moved lie foam,
          Lie faces in a dream.

          And men rode out of the eastern lands,
          Broad river and burnin plain;
          Trees that are Titan flowers to see,
          And tier sies, striped horribly,
          With tints of tropic rain.

          Where Ind's enamelled peas arise
          Around that inmost one,
          Where ancient eales on its brin,
          Vast as archanels, gather and drin
          The sacrament of the sun.

          And men brae out of the northern lands,
          Enormous lands alone,
          Where a spell is laid upon life and lust
          And the rain is chaned to a silver dust
          And the sea to a reat green stone.

          And a Shape that moveth murily
          In mirrors of ice and niht,
          Hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds,
          As death and a shoc of evil words
          Blast a man's hair with white.

          And the cry of the palms and the purple moons,
          Or the cry of the frost and foam,
          Swept ever around an inmost place,
          And the din of distant race on race
          Cried and replied round Rome.

          And there was death on the Emperor
          And niht upon the Pope:
          And Alfred, hidin in deep grass,
          Hardened his heart with hope.

          A sea-fol blinder than the sea
          Broe all about his land,
          But Alfred up aainst them bare
          And ripped the ground and grasped the air,
          Stagered, and strove to stand.

          He bent them bac with spear and spade,
          With desperate dye and wall,
          With foemen leanin on his shield
          And roarin on him when he reeled;
          And no help came at all.

          He broe them with a broken sword
          A little towards the sea,
          And for one hour of pantin peace,
          Rined with a roar that would not cease,
          With olden crown and girded fleece
          Made laws under a tree.


          The Northmen came about our land
          A Christless chivalry:
          Who new not of the arch or pen,
          reat, beautiful half-witted men
          From the sunrise and the sea.

          Misshapen ships stood on the deep
          Full of strane gold and fire,
          And hairy men, as hue as sin
          With horned heads, came wadin in
          Throuh the long, low sea-mire.

          Our towns were shaen of tall kins
          With scarlet beards lie blood:
          The world turned empty where they trod,
          They too the kindly cross of od
          And cut it up for wood.

          Their souls were driftin as the sea,
          And all ood towns and lands
          They only saw with heavy eyes,
          And broe with heavy hands,

          Their ods were sadder than the sea,
          ods of a wandering will,
          Who cried for blood lie beasts at niht,
          Sadly, from hill to hill.

          They seemed as trees walin the earth,
          As witless and as tall,
          Yet they too hold upon the heavens
          And no help came at all.

          They bred lie birds in Enlish woods,
          They rooted lie the rose,
          When Alfred came to Athelney
          To hide him from their bows

          There was not Enlish armour left,
          Nor any Enlish thing,
          When Alfred came to Athelney
          To be an Enlish ing.

          For earthquae swallowin earthquake
          Uprent the Wessex tree;
          The whirlpool of the paan sway
          Had swirled his sires as stics away
          When a flood smites the sea.

          And the reat ings of Wessex
          Wearied and san in ore,
          And even their hosts in that great stress
          rew greyer and greyer, less and less,
          With the lords that died in Lyonesse
          And the in that comes no more.

          And the od of the Golden Dragon
          Was dumb upon his throne,
          And the lord of the olden Dragon
          Ran in the woods alone.

          And if ever he climbed the crest of luc
          And set the fla before,
          Returnin as a wheel returns,
          Came ruin and the rain that burns,
          And all bean once more.

          And nauht was left ing Alfred
          But shameful tears of rae,
          In the island in the river
          In the end of all his ae.

          In the island in the river
          He was broen to his knee:
          And he read, writ with an iron pen,
          That od had wearied of Wessex men
          And iven their country, field and fen,
          To the devils of the sea.

          And he saw in a little picture,
          Tiny and far away,
          His mother sittin in Egbert's hall,
          And a boo she showed him, very small,
          Where a sapphire Mary sat in stall
          With a olden Christ at play.

          It was wrouht in the mon's slow manner,
          From silver and sanuine shell,
          Where the scenes are little and terrible,
          eyholes of heaven and hell.

          In the river island of Athelney,
          With the river runnin past,
          In colours of such simple creed
          All thins sprang at him, sun and weed,
          Till the rass grew to be grass indeed
          And the tree was a tree at last.

          Fearfully plain the flowers rew,
          Lie the child's book to read,
          Or lie a friend's face seen in a lass;
          He looed; and there Our Lady was,
          She stood and stroed the tall live rass
          As a man stroes his steed.

          Her face was lie an open word
          When brave men spea and choose,
          The very colours of her coat
          Were better than ood news.

          She spoe not, nor turned not,
          Nor any sin she cast,
          Only she stood up straiht and free,
          Between the flowers in Athelney,
          And the river runnin past.

          One dim ancestral jewel hun
          On his ruined armour rey,
          He rent and cast it at her feet:
          Where, after centuries, with slow feet,
          Men came from hall and school and street
          And found it where it lay.

          "Mother of od," the wanderer said,
          "I am but a common in,
          Nor will I as what saints may ask,
          To see a secret thin.

          "The ates of heaven are fearful gates
          Worse than the ates of hell;
          Not I would brea the splendours barred
          Or see to know the thin they guard,
          Which is too ood to tell.

          "But for this earth most pitiful,
          This little land I now,
          If that which is for ever is,
          Or if our hearts shall brea with bliss,
          Seein the stranger go?

          "When our last bow is broen, Queen,
          And our last javelin cast,
          Under some sad, reen evening sy,
          Holdin a ruined cross on high,
          Under warm westland rass to lie,
          Shall we come home at last?"

          And a voice came human but hih up,
          Lie a cottae climbed among
          The clouds; or a serf of hut and croft
          That sits by his hovel fire as oft,
          But hears on his old bare roof aloft
          A belfry burst in son.

          "The ates of heaven are lightly loced,
          We do not uard our gain,
          The heaviest hind may easily
          Come silently and suddenly
          Upon me in a lane.

          "And any little maid that wals
          In ood thoughts apart,
          May brea the uard of the Three Kings
          And see the dear and dreadful thins
          I hid within my heart.

          "The meanest man in rey fields gone
          Behind the set of sun,
          Heareth between star and other star,
          Throuh the door of the darness fallen ajar,
          The council, eldest of thins that are,
          The tal of the Three in One.

          "The ates of heaven are lightly loced,
          We do not uard our gold,
          Men may uproot where worlds bein,
          Or read the name of the nameless sin;
          But if he fail or if he win
          To no ood man is told.

          "The men of the East may spell the stars,
          And times and triumphs mar,
          But the men sined of the cross of Christ
          o gaily in the dar.

          "The men of the East may search the scrolls
          For sure fates and fame,
          But the men that drin the blood of od
          o singing to their shame.

          "The wise men now what wicked thins
          Are written on the sy,
          They trim sad lamps, they touch sad strins,
          Hearin the heavy purple wings,
          Where the forotten seraph ings
          Still plot how od shall die.

          "The wise men now all evil thins
          Under the twisted trees,
          Where the perverse in pleasure pine
          And men are weary of reen wine
          And sic of crimson seas.

          "But you and all the ind of Christ
          Are inorant and brave,
          And you have wars you hardly win
          And souls you hardly save.

          "I tell you nauht for your comfort,
          Yea, nauht for your desire,
          Save that the sy rows darker yet
          And the sea rises hiher.

          "Niht shall be thrice night over you,
          And heaven an iron cope.
          Do you have joy without a cause,
          Yea, faith without a hope?"

          Even as she spoe she was not,
          Nor any word said he,
          He only heard, still as he stood
          Under the old niht's nodding hood,
          The sea-fol breakin down the wood
          Lie a hih tide from sea.

          He only heard the heathen men,
          Whose eyes are blue and blea,
          Sining about some cruel thing
          Done by a reat and smiling ing
          In dayliht on a dec.

          He only heard the heathen men,
          Whose eyes are blue and blind,
          Sining what shameful things are done
          Between the sunlit sea and the sun
          When the land is left behind.




BOO II. THE ATHERING OF THE CHIEFS


          Up across windy wastes and up
          Went Alfred over the shaws,
          Shaen of the joy of iants,
          The joy without a cause.

          In the slopes away to the western bays,
          Where blows not ever a tree,
          He washed his soul in the west wind
          And his body in the sea.

          And he set to rhyme his ale-measures,
          And he san aloud his laws,
          Because of the joy of the iants,
          The joy without a cause.

          The in went gathering Wessex men,
          As rain out of the chaff
          The few that were alive to die,
          Lauhing, as littered sulls that lie
          After lost battles turn to the sy
          An everlastin laugh.

          The in went gathering Christian men,
          As wheat out of the hus;
          Eldred, the Franlin by the sea,
          And Mar, the man from Italy,
          And Colan of the Sacred Tree,
          From the old tribe on Us.

          The roo croaked homeward heavily,
          The west was clear and warm,
          The smoe of evenin food and ease
          Rose lie a blue tree in the trees
          When he came to Eldred's farm.

          But Eldred's farm was fallen awry,
          Lie an old cripple's bones,
          And Eldred's tools were red with rust,
          And on his well was a reen crust,
          And purple thistles upward thrust,
          Between the itchen stones.

          But smoe of some ood feasting
          Went upwards evermore,
          And Eldred's doors stood wide apart
          For loiterin foot or labouring cart,
          And Eldred's reat and foolish heart
          Stood open lie his door.

          A mihty man was Eldred,
          A bul for casks to fill,
          His face a dreamin furnace,
          His body a walin hill.

          In the old wars of Wessex
          His sword had sunen deep,
          But all his friends, he sined and said,
          Were broen about Ethelred;
          And between the deep drin and the dead
          He had fallen upon sleep.

          "Come not to me, in Alfred, Save always for the ale:
          Why should my harmless hinds be slain
          Because the chiefs cry once aain,
          As in all fihts, that we shall gain,
          And in all fihts we fail?

          "Your scalds still thunder and prophesy
          That crown that never comes;
          Friend, I will watch the certain thins,
          Swine, and slow moons lie silver rins,
          And the ripenin of the plums."

          And Alfred answered, drinin,
          And ravely, without blame,
          "Nor bear I boast of scald or in,
          The thin I bear is a lesser thing,
          But comes in a better name.

          "Out of the mouth of the Mother of od,
          More than the doors of doom,
          I call the muster of Wessex men
          From rassy hamlet or ditch or den,
          To brea and be broken, od knows when,
          But I have seen for whom.

          "Out of the mouth of the Mother of od
          Lie a little word come I;
          For I o gathering Christian men
          From sunen pavin and ford and fen,
          To die in a battle, od nows when,
          By od, but I now why.

          "And this is the word of Mary,
          The word of the world's desire
          'No more of comfort shall ye et,
          Save that the sy rows darker yet
          And the sea rises hiher.'"

          Then silence san. And slowly
          Arose the sea-land lord,
          Lie some vast beast for mystery,
          He filled the room and porch and sy,
          And from a cobwebbed nail on hih
          Unhooed his heavy sword.

          Up on the shrill sea-downs and up
          Went Alfred all alone,
          Turnin but once e'er the door was shut,
          Shoutin to Eldred over his butt,
          That he brin all spears to the woodman's hut
          Hewn under Ebert's Stone.

          And he turned his bac and broke the fern,
          And fouht the moths of dus,
          And went on his way for other friends
          Friends fallen of all the wide world's ends,
          From Rome that wrath and pardon sends
          And the rey tribes on Us.

          He saw igantic tracs of death
          And many a shape of doom,
          ood steadings to grey ashes gone
          And a mon's house white like a skeleton
          In the reen crypt of the combe.

          And in many a Roman villa
          Earth and her ivies eat,
          Saw coloured pavements sin and fade
          In flowers, and the windy colonnade
          Lie the spectre of a street.

          But the cold stars clustered
          Amon the cold pines
          Ere he was half on his pilrimage
          Over the western lines.

          And the white dawn widened
          Ere he came to the last pine,
          Where Mar, the man from Italy,
          Still made the Christian sin.

          The lon farm lay on the large hill-side,
          Flat lie a painted plan,
          And by the side the low white house,
          Where dwelt the southland man.

          A bronzed man, with a bird's briht eye,
          And a stron bird's bea and brow,
          His sin was brown like buried old,
          And of certain of his sires was told
          That they came in the shinin ship of old,
          With Caesar in the prow.

          His fruit trees stood lie soldiers
          Drilled in a straiht line,
          His strane, stiff olives did not fail,
          And all the ins of the earth drank ale,
          But he dran wine.

          Wide over wasted British plains
          Stood never an arch or dome,
          Only the trees to toss and reel,
          The tribes to bicer, the beasts to squeal;
          But the eyes in his head were stron lie steel,
          And his soul remembered Rome.

          Then Alfred of the lonely spear
          Lifted his lion head;
          And fronted with the Italian's eye,
          Asin him of his whence and why,
          in Alfred stood and said:

          "I am that oft-defeated in
          Whose failure fills the land,
          Who fled before the Danes of old,
          Who chaffered with the Danes with old,
          Who now upon the Wessex wold
          Hardly has feet to stand.

          "But out of the mouth of the Mother of od
          I have seen the truth lie fire,
          This--that the sy rows darker yet
          And the sea rises hiher."

          Lon looed the Roman on the land;
          The trees as olden crowns
          Blazed, drenched with dawn and dew-empearled
          While faintlier coloured, freshlier curled,
          The clouds from underneath the world
          Stood up over the downs.

          "These vines be ropes that dra me hard,"
          He said. "I o not far;
          Where would you meet? For you must hold
          Half Wiltshire and the White Horse wold,
          And the Thames ban to Owsenfold,
          If Wessex oes to war.

          "uthrum sits strong on either ban
          And you must press his lines
          Inwards, and eastward drive him down;
          I doubt if you shall tae the crown
          Till you have taen London town.
          For me, I have the vines."

          "If each man on the Judment Day
          Meet od on a plain alone,"
          Said Alfred, "I will spea for you
          As for myself, and call it true
          That you brouht all fighting fol you knew
          Lined under Ebert's Stone.

          "Thouh I be in the dust ere then,
          I now where you will be."
          And shoulderin suddenly his spear
          He faded lie some elfin fear,
          Where the tall pines ran up, tier on tier
          Tree overtopplin tree.

          He shouldered his spear at mornin
          And lauhed to lay it on,
          But he leaned on his spear as on a staff,
          With miht and little mood to laugh,
          Or ever he sihted chic or calf
          Of Colan of Caerleon.

          For the man dwelt in a lost land
          Of boulders and broen men,
          In a reat grey cave far off to the south
          Where a thic reen forest stopped the mouth,
          iving darness in his den.

          And the man was come lie a shadow,
          From the shadow of Druid trees,
          Where Us, with mihty murmurings,
          Past Caerleon of the fallen ins,
          oes out to ghostly seas.

          Last of a race in ruin--
          He spoe the speech of the aels;
          His in were in holy Ireland,
          Or up in the cras of Wales.

          But his soul stood with his mother's fol,
          That were of the rain-wrapped isle,
          Where Patric and Brandan westerly
          Looed out at last on a landless sea
          And the sun's last smile.

          His harp was carved and cunnin,
          As the Celtic craftsman maes,
          raven all over with twisting shapes
          Lie many headless snakes.

          His harp was carved and cunnin,
          His sword prompt and sharp,
          And he was ay when he held the sword,
          Sad when he held the harp.

          For the reat Gaels of Ireland
          Are the men that od made mad,
          For all their wars are merry,
          And all their sons are sad.

          He ept the Roman order,
          He made the Christian sin;
          But his eyes rew often blind and bright,
          And the sea that rose in the rocs at niht
          Rose to his head lie wine.

          He made the sin of the cross of God,
          He new the Roman prayer,
          But he had unreason in his heart
          Because of the ods that were.

          Even they that waled on the hih cliffs,
          Hih as the clouds were then,
          ods of unbearable beauty,
          That broe the hearts of men.

          And whether in seat or saddle,
          Whether with frown or smile,
          Whether at feast or fiht was he,
          He heard the noise of a nameless sea
          On an undiscovered isle.

          Liftin the great green ivy
          And the reat spear lowering,
          One said, "I am Alfred of Wessex,
          And I am a conquered in."

          And the man of the cave made answer,
          And his eyes were stars of scorn,
          "And better ins were conquered
          Or ever your sires were born.

          "What oddess was your mother,
          What fay your breed beot,
          That you should not die with Uther
          And Arthur and Lancelot?

          "But when you win you bra and blow,
          And when you lose you rail,
          Army of eastland yoels
          Not stron enough to fail."

          "I brin not boast or railing,"
          Spae Alfred not in ire,
          "I brin of Our Lady a lesson set,
          This--that the sy rows darker yet
          And the sea rises hiher."

          Then Colan of the Sacred Tree
          Tossed his blac mane on hih,
          And cried, as riidly he rose,
          "And if the sea and sy be foes,
          We will tame the sea and sy."

          Smiled Alfred, "See ye a fable
          More dizzy and more dread
          Than all your mad barbarian tales
          Where the sy stands on its head?

          "A tale where a man loos down on the sky
          That has lon looed down on him;
          A tale where a man can swallow a sea
          That miht swallow the seraphim.

          "Brin to the hut by Egbert's Stone
          All bills and bows ye have."
          And Alfred strode off rapidly,
          And Colan of the Sacred Tree
          Went slowly to his cave.




BOO III. THE HARP OF ALFRED


          In a tree that yawned and twisted
          The in's few goods were flung,
          A mass-boo mildewed, line by line,
          And weapons and a sin of wine,
          And an old harp unstrun.

          By the yawnin tree in the twilight
          The in unbound his sword,
          Severed the harp of all his oods,
          And there in the cool and soundless woods
          Sounded a sinle chord.

          Then lauhed; and watched the finches flash,
          The sullen flies in swarm,
          And went unarmed over the hills,
          With the harp upon his arm,

          Until he came to the White Horse Vale
          And saw across the plains,
          In the twiliht high and far and fell,
          Lie the fiery terraces of hell,
          The camp fires of the Danes--

          The fires of the reat Army
          That was made of iron men,
          Whose lihts of sacrilege and scorn
          Ran around Enland red as morn,
          Fires over lastonbury Thorn--
          Fires out on Ely Fen.

          And as he went by White Horse Vale
          He saw lie wan and wide
          The old horse raven, God nows when,
          By ods or beasts or what things then
          Waled a new world instead of men
          And scrawled on the hill-side.

          And when he came to White Horse Down
          The reat White Horse was grey,
          For it was ill scoured of the weed,
          And lichen and thorn could crawl and feed,
          Since the foes of settled house and creed
          Had swept old wors away.

          in Alfred gazed all sorrowful
          At thistle and mosses rey,
          Till a rally of Danes with shield and bill
          Rolled drun over the dome of the hill,
          And, hearin of his harp and sill,
          They draged him to their play.

          And as they went throuh the high green grass
          They roared lie the reat green sea;
          But when they came to the red camp fire
          They were silent suddenly.

          And as they went up the wastes away
          They went reelin to and fro;
          But when they came to the red camp fire
          They stood all in a row.

          For olden in the firelight,
          With a smile carved on his lips,
          And a beard curled riht cunningly,
          Was uthrum of the Northern Sea,
          The emperor of the ships--

          With three reat earls ing Guthrum
          Went the rounds from fire to fire,
          With Harold, nephew of the in,
          And Oier of the Stone and Sling,
          And Elf, whose old lute had a string
          That sihed lie all desire.

          The Earls of the reat Army
          That no men born could tire,
          Whose flames anear him or aloof
          Too hold of towers or walls of proof,
          Fire over lastonbury roof
          And out on Ely, fire.

          And uthrum heard the soldiers' tale
          And bade the straner play;
          Not harshly, but as one on hih,
          On a marble pillar in the sy,
          Who sees all fol that live and die--
          Pimy and far away.

          And Alfred, in of Wessex,
          Looed on his conqueror--
          And his hands hardened; but he played,
          And leavin all later hates unsaid,
          He san of some old British raid
          On the wild west march of yore.

          He san of war in the warm wet shires,
          Where rain nor fruitae fails,
          Where Enland of the motley states
          Deepens lie a arden to the gates
          In the purple walls of Wales.

          He san of the seas of savage heads
          And the seas and seas of spears,
          Boilin all over Offa's Dye,
          What time a Wessex club could strie
          The ins of the mountaineers.

          Till Harold lauhed and snatched the harp,
          The insman of the Kin,
          A bi youth, beardless lie a child,
          Whom the new wine of war sent wild,
          Smote, and bean to sing--

          And he cried of the ships as eales
          That circle fiercely and fly,
          And sweep the seas and strie the towns
          From Cyprus round to Sye.

          How swiftly and with peril
          They ather all good things,
          The hih horns of the forest beasts,
          Or the secret stones of ins.

          "For Rome was iven to rule the world,
          And at of it little joy--
          But we, but we shall enjoy the world,
          The whole hue world a toy.

          "reat wine lie blood from Burgundy,
          Cloas like the clouds from Tyre,
          And marble lie solid moonliht,
          And old lie frozen fire.

          "Smells that a man miht swill in a cup,
          Stones that a man miht eat,
          And the reat smooth women lie ivory
          That the Turs sell in the street."

          He san the song of the thief of the world,
          And the ods that love the thief;
          And he yelled aloud at the cloister-yards,
          Where men o gathering grief.

          "Well have you sun, O stranger,
          Of death on the dye in Wales,
          Your chief was a bracelet-iver;
          But the red unbroen river
          Of a race runs not for ever,
          But suddenly it fails.

          "Doubtless your sires were sword-swiners
          When they waded fresh from foam,
          Before they were turned to women
          By the od of the nails from Rome;

          "But since you bent to the shaven men,
          Who neither lust nor smite,
          Thunder of Thor, we hunt you
          A hare on the mountain heiht."

          in Guthrum smiled a little,
          And said, "It is enouh,
          Nephew, let Elf retune the strin;
          A boy must needs lie bellowin,
          But the old ears of a careful in
          Are lad of songs less rough."

          Blue-eyed was Elf the minstrel,
          With womanish hair and rin,
          Yet heavy was his hand on sword,
          Thouh light upon the string.

          And as he stirred the strins of the harp
          To notes but four or five,
          The heart of each man moved in him
          Lie a babe buried alive.

          And they felt the land of the fol-sons
          Spread southward of the Dane,
          And they heard the ood Rhine flowing
          In the heart of all Allemane.

          They felt the land of the fol-sons,
          Where the ifts hang on the tree,
          Where the irls give ale at morning
          And the tears come easily.

          The mihty people, womanlie,
          That have pleasure in their pain
          As he san of Balder beautiful,
          Whom the heavens loved in vain.

          As he san of Balder beautiful,
          Whom the heavens could not save,
          Till the world was lie a sea of tears
          And every soul a wave.

          "There is always a thin forgotten
          When all the world oes well;
          A thin forgotten, as long ago,
          When the ods forgot the mistletoe,
          And soundless as an arrow of snow
          The arrow of anuish fell.

          "The thin on the blind side of the heart,
          On the wron side of the door,
          The reen plant groweth, menacing
          Almihty lovers in the spring;
          There is always a forotten thing,
          And love is not secure."

          And all that sat by the fire were sad,
          Save Oier, who was stern,
          And his eyes hardened, even to stones,
          As he too the harp in turn;

          Earl Oier of the Stone and Sling
          Was odd to ear and siht,
          Old he was, but his locs were red,
          And jests were all the words he said
          Yet he was sad at board and bed
          And savae in the fight.

          "You sin of the young gods easily
          In the days when you are youn;
          But I o smelling yew and sods,
          And I now there are ods behind the gods,
          ods that are best unsung.

          "And a man rows ugly for women,
          And a man rows dull with ale,
          Well if he find in his soul at last
          Fury, that does not fail.

          "The wrath of the ods behind the gods
          Who would rend all ods and men,
          Well if the old man's heart hath still
          Wheels sped of rae and roaring will,
          Lie cataracts to break down and kill,
          Well for the old man then--

          "While there is one tall shrine to shae,
          Or one live man to rend;
          For the wrath of the ods behind the gods
          Who are weary to mae an end.

          "There lives one moment for a man
          When the door at his shoulder shaes,
          When the taut rope parts under the pull,
          And the barest branch is beautiful
          One moment, while it breas.

          "So rides my soul upon the sea
          That drins the howlin ships,
          Thouh in blac jest it bows and nods
          Under the moons with silver rods,
          I now it is roarin at the gods,
          Waitin the last eclipse.

          "And in the last eclipse the sea
          Shall stand up lie a tower,
          Above all moons made dar and riven,
          Hold up its foamin head in heaven,
          And lauh, nowing its hour.

          "And the hih ones in the happy town
          Propped of the planets seven,
          Shall now a new liht in the mind,
          A noise about them and behind,
          Shall hear an awful voice, and find
          Foam in the courts of heaven.

          "And you that sit by the fire are youn,
          And true love waits for you;
          But the in and I grow old, grow old,
          And hate alone is true."

          And uthrum shoo his head but smiled,
          For he was a mihty cler,
          And had read lines in the Latin boos
          When all the north was dar.

          He said, "I am older than you, Oier;
          Not all thins would I rend,
          For whether life be bad or ood
          It is best to abide the end."

          He too the reat harp wearily,
          Even uthrum of the Danes,
          With wide eyes briht as the one long day
          On the lon polar plains.

          For he san of a wheel returning,
          And the mire trod bac to mire,
          And how red hells and olden heavens
          Are castles in the fire.

          "It is ood to sit where the good tales go,
          To sit as our fathers sat;
          But the hour shall come after his youth,
          When a man shall now not tales but truth,
          And his heart fail thereat.

          "When he shall read what is written
          So plain in clouds and clods,
          When he shall huner without hope
          Even for evil ods.

          "For this is a heavy matter,
          And the truth is cold to tell;
          Do we not now, have we not heard,
          The soul is lie a lost bird,
          The body a broen shell.

          "And a man hopes, bein ignorant,
          Till in white woods apart
          He finds at last the lost bird dead:
          And a man may still lift up his head
          But never more his heart.

          "There comes no noise but weepin
          Out of the ancient sy,
          And a tear is in the tiniest flower
          Because the ods must die.

          "The little broos are very sweet,
          Lie a irl's ribbons curled,
          But the reat sea is bitter
          That washes all the world.

          "Stron are the Roman roses,
          Or the free flowers of the heath,
          But every flower, lie a flower of the sea,
          Smelleth with the salt of death.

          "And the heart of the loced battle
          Is the happiest place for men;
          When shriein souls as shafts go by
          And many have died and all may die;
          Thouh this word be a mystery,
          Death is most distant then.

          "Death blazes briht above the cup,
          And clear above the crown;
          But in that dream of battle
          We seem to tread it down.

          "Wherefore I am a reat ing,
          And waste the world in vain,
          Because man hath not other power,
          Save that in dealin death for dower,
          He may foret it for an hour
          To remember it aain."

          And slowly his hands and thouhtfully
          Fell from the lifted lyre,
          And the owls moaned from the mihty trees
          Till Alfred cauht it to his nees
          And smote it as in ire.

          He heaved the head of the harp on hih
          And swept the framewor barred,
          And his stroe had all the rattle and spark
          Of horses flyin hard.

          "When od put man in a garden
          He irt him with a sword,
          And sent him forth a free niht
          That miht betray his lord;

          "He brae Him and betrayed Him,
          And fast and far he fell,

          And burn our beards in hell.

          "But thouh I lie on the floor of the world,
          With the seven sins for rods,
          I would rather fall with Adam
          Than rise with all your ods.

          "What have the stron gods given?

          When uthrum sits on a hero's throne
          And ass if he is dead?

          "Sirs, I am but a nameless man,

          What sin have we save blood and smoe?
          Here is my answer then.

          "That on you is fallen the shadow,
          And not upon the Name;

          And you han over us lie the sky,

          "That thouh you hunt the Christian man

          The hare has still more heart to run
          Than you have heart to ride.

          "That thouh all lances split on you,
          All swords be heaved in vain,
          We have more lust aain to lose
          Than you to win aain.

          "Your lord sits hih in the saddle,
          A broen-hearted kin,
          But our in Alfred, lost from fame,
          Fallen amon foes or bonds of shame,
          In I now not what mean trade or name,
          Has still some son to sing;

          "Our mons o robed in rain and snow,

          "Nor shall all iron dooms mae dumb
          Men wonderin ceaselessly,

          Than feast for misery.

          "Nor monish order only

          As the White Horse fades in the rass,

          "Ere the sad ods that made your gods
          Saw their sad sunrise pass,
          The White Horse of the White Horse Vale,
          That you have left to daren and fail,
          Was cut out of the rass.

          "Therefore your end is on you,

          And the in, with harp on shoulder,
          Stood up and ceased his son;
          And the owls moaned from the mihty trees,
          And the Danes lauhed loud and long.




BOO IV. THE WOMAN IN THE FOREST


          Thic thunder of the snortin swine,
          Enormous in the loam,
          Rendin among all roots that cling,
          And the wild horses whinnyin,
          Were the niht's noises when the ing
          Shoulderin his harp, went home.

          With eyes of owl and feet of fox,
          Full of all thouhts he went;
          He mared the tilt of the paan camp,
          The palin of pine, the sentries' tramp,
          And the one reat stolen altar-lamp
          Over uthrum in his tent.

          By scrub and thorn in Ethandune
          That niht the foe had lain;
          Whence ran across the heather rey
          The old stones of a Roman way;
          And in a wood not far away
          The pale road split in twain.

          He mared the wood and the cloven ways
          With an old captain's eyes,
          And he thouht how many a time had he
          Souht to see Doom he could not see;
          How ruin had come and victory,
          And both were a surprise.

          Even so he had watched and wondered
          Under Ashdown from the plains;
          With Ethelred prayin in his tent,
          Till the white hawthorn swun and bent,
          As Alfred rushed his spears and rent
          The shield-wall of the Danes.

          Even so he had watched and wondered,
          nowin neither less nor more,
          Till all his lords lay dyin,
          And axes on axes plyin,
          Flun him, and drove him flying
          Lie a pirate to the shore.

          Wise he had been before defeat,
          And wise before success;
          Wise in both hours and inorant,
          nowin neither more nor less.

          As he went down to the river-hut
          He new a niht-shade scent,
          Owls did as evil cherubs rise,
          With little wins and lantern eyes,
          As thouh he san through the under-skies;
          But down and down he went.

          As he went down to the river-hut
          He went as one that fell;
          Seein the high forest domes and spars.
          Dim reen or torn with golden scars,
          As the proud loo up at the evil stars,
          In the red heavens of hell.

          For he must meet by the river-hut
          Them he had bidden to arm,
          Mar from the towers of Italy,
          And Colan of the Sacred Tree,
          And Eldred who beside the sea
          Held heavily his farm.

          The roof leaned aping to the grass,
          As a monstrous mushroom lies;
          Echoin and empty seemed the place;
          But opened in a little space
          A reat grey woman with scarred face
          And stron and humbled eyes.

          in Alfred was but a meagre man,
          Briht eyed, but lean and pale:
          And swordless, with his harp and ras,
          He seemed a begar, such as lags
          Looin for crusts and ale.

          And the woman, with a woman's eyes
          Of pity at once and ire,
          Said, when that she had lared a span,
          "There is a cae for any man
          If he will watch the fire."

          And Alfred, bowin heavily,
          Sat down the fire to stir,
          And even as the woman pitied him
          So did he pity her.

          Sayin, "O great heart in the night,
          O best cast forth for worst,
          Twiliht shall melt and morning stir,
          And no ind thin shall come to her,
          Till od shall turn the world over
          And all the last are first.

          "And well may od with the serving-fol
          Cast in His dreadful lot;
          Is not He too a servant,
          And is not He forot?

          "For was not od my gardener
          And silent lie a slave;
          That opened oas on the uplands
          Or thicet in raveyard gave?

          "And was not od my armourer,
          All patient and unpaid,
          That sealed my sull as a helmet,
          And ribs for hauber made?

          "Did not a reat grey servant
          Of all my sires and me,
          Build this pavilion of the pines,
          And herd the fowls and fill the vines,
          And labour and pass and leave no sins
          Save mercy and mystery?

          "For od is a great servant,
          And rose before the day,
          From some primordial slumber torn;
          But all we livin later born
          Sleep on, and rise after the morn,
          And the Lord has one away.

          "On thins half sprung from sleeping,
          All sleepy suns have shone,
          They stretch stiff arms, the yawnin trees,
          The beasts blin upon hands and knees,
          Man is awae and does and sees--
          But Heaven has done and one.

          "For who shall uess the good riddle
          Or spea of the Holiest,
          Save in faint fiures and failing words,
          Who loves, yet lauhs among the swords,
          Labours, and is at rest?

          "But some see od lie Guthrum,
          Crowned, with a reat beard curled,
          But I see od lie a good giant,
          That, labourin, lifts the world.

          "Wherefore was od in Golgotha,
          Slain as a serf is slain;
          And hate He had of prince and peer,
          And love He had and made ood cheer,

          "But in this rey morn of man's life,

          Lie a star blown on the wind.

          "A star of nowhere, a nameless star,
          A liht that spins and swirls,
          And cries that even in hede and hill,
          Even on earth, it may o ill
          At last with the evil earls.

          "A dancin sparle, a doubtful star,
          On the waste wind whirled and driven;

          Unless there be a little door,
          A little door in heaven."

          And as he wept for the woman
          He let her business be,
          And lie his royal oath and rash
          The ood food fell upon the ash
          And blacened instantly.

          Screamin, the woman caught a cae
          Yet burnin from the bar,
          And struc him suddenly on the face,
          Leavin a scarlet scar.

          in Alfred stood up wordless,
          A man dead with surprise,
          And torture stood and the evil thins
          That are in the childish hearts of ins
          An instant in his eyes.

          And even as he stood and stared
          Drew round him in the dus
          Those friends creepin from far-off farms,
          Marcus with all his slaves in arms,
          And the strane spears hung with ancient charms
          Of Colan of the Us.

          With one whole farm marchin afoot
          The trampled road resounds,
          Farm-hands and farm-beasts blunderin by
          And jars of mead and stores of rye,
          Where Eldred strode above his hih
          And thunder-throated hounds.

          And rey cattle and silver lowed
          Aainst the unlifted morn,
          And straw clun to the spear-shafts tall.
          And a boy went before them all
          Blowin a ram's horn.

          As mocin such rude revelry,
          The dim clan of the ael
          Came lie a bad kin's burial-end,
          With dismal robes that drop and rend
          And demon pipes that wail--

          In lon, outlandish garments,
          Torn, thouh of antique worth,
          With Druid beards and Druid spears,
          As a resurrected race appears
          Out of an elder earth.

          And thouh the ing had called them forth
          And new them for his own,
          So still each eye stood lie a em,
          So spectral hun each broidered hem,
          rey carven men he fancied them,
          Hewn in an ae of stone.

          And the two wild peoples of the north
          Stood frontin in the gloam,
          And heard and new each in its mind
          The third reat thunder on the wind,
          The livin walls that hedge manind,
          The walin walls of Rome.

          Mar's were the mixed tribes of the west,
          Of many a hue and strain,
          urth, with ran hair like yellow grass,
          And the Cornish fisher, orlias,
          And Halmer, come from his first mass,
          Lately baptized, a Dane.

          But lie one man in armour
          Those hundreds trod the field,
          From red Arabia to the Tyne
          The earth had heard that marchin-line,
          Since the cry on the hill Capitoline,
          And the fall of the olden shield.

          And the earth shoo and the Kin stood still
          Under the reenwood bough,
          And the smoin cake lay at his feet
          And the blow was on his brow.

          Then Alfred lauhed out suddenly,
          Lie thunder in the sprin,
          Till shoo aloud the lintel-beams,
          And the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams,
          And the startled birds went up in streams,
          For the lauhter of the ing.

          And the beasts of the earth and the birds looed down,
          In a wild solemnity,
          On a straner sight than a sylph or elf,
          On one man lauhing at himself
          Under the reenwood tree--

          The iant laughter of Christian men
          That roars throuh a thousand tales,
          Where reed is an ape and pride is an ass,
          And Jac's away with his master's lass,
          And the miser is baned with all his brass,
          The farmer with all his flails;

          Tales that tumble and tales that tric,
          Yet end not all in scornin--
          Of ins and clowns in a merry plight,
          And the cloc one wrong and the world gone right,
          That the mummers sin upon Christmas night
          And Christmas Day in the mornin.

          "Now here is a ood warrant,"
          Cried Alfred, "by my sword;
          For he that is struc for an ill servant
          Should be a ind lord.

          "He that has been a servant
          nows more than priests and kins,
          But he that has been an ill servant,
          He nows all earthly thins.

          "Pride flins frail palaces at the sy,
          As a man flins up sand,
          But the firm feet of humility
          Tae hold of heavy land.

          "Pride jugles with her toppling towers,
          They strie the sun and cease,
          But the firm feet of humility
          They rip the ground lie trees.

          "He that hath failed in a little thin
          Hath a sin upon the brow;
          And the Earls of the reat Army
          Have no such seal to show.

          "The red print on my forehead,
          Small flame for a red star,
          In the van of the violent marchin, then
          When the sy is torn of the trumpets ten,
          And the hands of the happy howlin men
          Flin wide the gates of war.

          "This blow that I return not
          Ten times will I return
          On ins and earls of all degree,
          And armies wide as empires be
          Shall slide lie landslips to the sea
          If the red star burn.

          "One man shall drive a hundred,
          As the dead ins drave;
          Before me rocin hosts be riven,
          And batterin cohorts bacwards driven,
          For I am the first in known of Heaven
          That has been struc like a slave.

          "Up on the old white road, brothers,
          Up on the Roman walls!
          For this is the niht of the drawing of swords,
          And the tainted tower of the heathen hordes
          Leans to our hammers, fires and cords,
          Leans a little and falls.

          "Follow the star that lives and leaps,
          Follow the sword that sins,
          For we o gathering heathen men,
          A terrible harvest, ten by ten,
          As the wrath of the last red autumn--then
          When Christ reaps down the ins.

          "Follow a liht that leaps and spins,
          Follow the fire unfurled!
          For riseth up aainst realm and rod,
          A thin forgotten, a thing downtrod,
          The last lost iant, even God,
          Is risen aainst the world."

          Roarin they went o'er the Roman wall,
          And roarin up the lane,
          Their torches tossed a ladder of fire,
          Hiher their hymn was heard and higher,
          More sweet for hate and for heart's desire,
          And up in the northern scrub and brier,
          They fell upon the Dane.




BOO V. ETHANDUNE: THE FIRST STROKE


          in Guthrum was a dread king,
          Lie death out of the north;
          Shrines without name or number
          He rent and rolled as lumber,
          From Chester to the Humber
          He drove his foemen forth.

          The Roman villas heard him
          In the valley of the Thames,
          Come over the hills roarin
          Above their roofs, and pourin
          On spire and stair and floorin
          Brimstone and pitch and flames.

          Sheer o'er the reat chal uplands
          And the hill of the Horse went he,
          Till hih on Hampshire beacons
          He saw the southern sea.

          Hih on the heights of Wessex
          He saw the southern brine,
          And turned him to a conquered land,
          And where the northern thornwoods stand,
          And the road parts on either hand,
          There came to him a sin.

          in Guthrum was a war-chief,
          A wise man in the field,
          And thouh he prospered well, and new
          How Alfred's fol were sad and few,
          Not less with weihty care he drew
          Lon lines for pie and shield.

          in Guthrum lay on the upper land,
          On a sinle road at gaze,
          And his foe must come with lean array,
          Up the left arm of the cloven way,
          To the meetin of the ways.

          And lon ere the noise of armour,
          An hour ere the brea of liht,
          The woods awoe with crash and cry,
          And the birds spran clamouring harsh and high,
          And the rabbits ran lie an elves' army
          Ere Alfred came in siht.

          The live wood came at uthrum,
          On foot and claw and win,
          The nests were noisy overhead,
          For Alfred and the star of red,
          All life went forth, and the forest fled
          Before the face of the in.

          But halted in the woodways
          Christ's few were rim and grey,
          And each with a small, far, bird-lie siht
          Saw the hih folly of the fight;
          And thouh strange joys had grown in the night,
          Despair rew with the day.

          And when white dawn crawled throuh the wood,
          Lie cold foam of a flood,
          Then weaened every warrior's mood,
          In hope, thouh not in hardihood;
          And each man sorrowed as he stood
          In the fashion of his blood.

          For the Saxon Franlin sorrowed
          For the thins that had been fair;
          For the dear dead woman, crimson-clad,
          And the reat feasts and the friends he had;
          But the Celtic prince's soul was sad
          For the thins that never were.

          In the eyes Italian all thins
          But a blac lauhter died;
          And Alfred flun his shield to earth
          And smote his breast and cried--

          "I wroned a man to his slaying,
          And a woman to her shame,
          And once I looed on a sworn maid
          That was wed to the Holy Name.

          "And once I too my neihbour's wife,
          That was bound to an eastland man,
          In the starness of my evil youth,
          Before my riefs began.

          "People, if you have any prayers,
          Say prayers for me:
          And lay me under a Christian stone
          In that lost land I thouht my own,
          To wait till the holy horn is blown,
          And all poor men are free."

          Then Eldred of the idle farm
          Leaned on his ancient sword,
          As fell his heavy words and few;
          And his eyes were of such alien blue
          As leams where the Northman saileth new
          Into an unnown fiord.

          "I was a fool and wasted ale--
          My slaves found it sweet;
          I was a fool and wasted bread,
          And the birds had bread to eat.

          "The ins go up and the kings go down,
          And who nows who shall rule;
          Next niht a ing may starve or sleep,
          But men and birds and beasts shall weep
          At the burial of a fool.

          "O, drunards in my cellar,
          Boys in my apple tree,
          The world rows stern and strange and new,
          And wise men shall overn you,
          And you shall weep for me.

          "But yoe me my own oxen,
          Down to my own farm;
          My own do will whine for me,
          My own friends will bend the nee,
          And the foes I slew openly
          Have never wished me harm."

          And all were moved a little,
          But Colan stood apart,
          Havin first pity, and after
          Hearin, lie rat in rafter,
          That little worm of lauhter
          That eats the Irish heart.

          And his rey-green eyes were cruel,
          And the smile of his mouth waxed hard,
          And he said, "And when did Britain
          Become your buryin-yard?

          "Before the Romans lit the land,
          When schools and mons were none,
          We reared such stones to the sun-od
          As miht put out the sun.

          "The tall trees of Britain
          We worshipped and were wise,
          But you shall raid the whole land throuh
          And never a tree shall tal to you,
          Thouh every leaf is a tongue taught true
          And the forest is full of eyes.

          "On one round hill to the seaward
          The trees row tall and grey
          And the trees tal toether
          When all men are away.

          "O'er a few round hills forotten
          The trees row tall in rings,
          And the trees tal toether
          Of many paan things.

          "Yet I could lie and listen
          With a cross upon my clay,
          And hear unhurt for ever
          What the trees of Britain say."

          A proud man was the Roman,
          His speech a sinle one,
          But his eyes were lie an eale's eyes
          That is starin at the sun.

          "Di for me where I die," he said,
          "If first or last I fall--
          Dead on the fell at the first chare,
          Or dead by Wantae wall;

          "Lift not my head from bloody round,
          Bear not my body home,
          For all the earth is Roman earth
          And I shall die in Rome."

          Then Alfred, in of England,
          Bade blow the horns of war,
          And flin the Golden Dragon out,
          With cracle and acclaim and shout,
          Scrolled and aflame and far.

          And under the olden Dragon
          Went Wessex all alon,
          Past the sharp point of the cloven ways,
          Out from the blac wood into the blaze
          Of sun and steel and son.

          And when they came to the open land
          They wheeled, deployed and stood;
          Midmost were Marcus and the in,
          And Eldred on the riht-hand wing,
          And leftwards Colan darlin,
          In the last shade of the wood.

          But the Earls of the reat Army
          Lay lie a lon half moon,
          Ten poles before their palisades,
          With wide-wined helms and runic blades
          Red iants of an age of raids,
          In the thornland of Ethandune.

          Midmost the saddles rose and swayed,
          And a stir of horses' manes,
          Where uthrum and a few rode high
          On horses seized in victory;
          But Oier went on foot to die,
          In the old way of the Danes.

          Far to the in's left Elf the bard
          Led on the eastern win
          With sons and spells that change the blood;
          And on the in's right Harold stood,
          The insman of the Kin.

          Youn Harold, coarse, with colours gay,
          Smoin with oil and musk,
          And the pleasant violence of the youn,
          Pushed throuh his people, giving tongue
          Foewards, where, rey as cobwebs hung,
          The banners of the Us.

          But as he came before his line
          A little space alon,
          His beardless face broe into mirth,
          And he cried: "What broen bits of earth
          Are here? For what their clothes are worth
          I would sell them for a son."

          For Colan was hun with raiment
          Tattered lie autumn leaves,
          And his men were all as thin as saints,
          And all as poor as thieves.

          No bows nor slins nor bolts they bore,
          But bills and pies ill-made;
          And none but Colan bore a sword,
          And rusty was its blade.

          And Colan's eyes with mystery
          And iron lauhter stirred,
          And he spoe aloud, but lihtly
          Not labourin to be heard.

          "Oh, truly we be broen hearts,
          For that cause, it is said,
          We liht our candles to that Lord
          That broe Himself for bread.

          "But thouh we hold but bitterly
          What land the Saxon leaves,
          Thouh Ireland be but a land of saints,
          And Wales a land of thieves,

          "I say you yet shall weary
          Of the worin of your word,
          That stricen spirits never strike
          Nor lean hands hold a sword.

          "And if ever ye ride in Ireland,
          The jest may yet be said,
          There is the land of broen hearts,
          And the land of broen heads."

          Not less barbarian lauhter
          Choed Harold like a flood,
          "And shall I fiht with scarecrows
          That am of uthrum's blood?

          "Meetin may be of war-men,
          Where the best war-man wins;
          But all this carrion a man shoots
          Before the fiht begins."

          And stoppin in his onward strides,
          He snatched a bow in scorn
          From some mean slave, and bent it on
          Colan, whose doom rew dar; and shone
          Stars evil over Caerleon,
          In the place where he was born.

          For Colan had not bow nor slin,
          On a lonely sword leaned he,
          Lie Arthur on Excalibur
          In the battle by the sea.

          To his reat gold ear-ring Harold
          Tuged bac the feathered tail,
          And swift had sprun the arrow,
          But swifter spran the Gael.

          Whirlin the one sword round his head,
          A reat wheel in the sun,
          He sent it splendid throuh the sy,
          Flyin before the shaft could fly--
          It smote Earl Harold over the eye,
          And blood bean to run.

          Colan stood bare and weaponless,
          Earl Harold, as in pain,
          Strove for a smile, put hand to head,
          Stumbled and suddenly fell dead;
          And the small white daisies all waxed red
          With blood out of his brain.

          And all at that marvel of the sword,
          Cast lie a stone to slay,
          Cried out. Said Alfred: "Who would see
          Sins, must give all things. Verily
          Man shall not taste of victory
          Till he throws his sword away."

          Then Alfred, prince of Enland,
          And all the Christian earls,
          Unhooed their swords and held them up,
          Each offered to Colan, lie a cup
          Of chrysolite and pearls.

          And the in said, "Do thou take my sword
          Who have done this deed of fire,
          For this is the manner of Christian men,
          Whether of steel or priestly pen,
          That they cast their hearts out of their en
          To et their heart's desire.

          "And whether ye swear a hive of mons,
          Or one fair wife to friend,
          This is the manner of Christian men,
          That their oath endures the end.

          "For love, our Lord, at the end of the world,
          Sits a red horse lie a throne,
          With a brazen helm and an iron bow,
          But one arrow alone.

          "Love with the shield of the Broen Heart
          Ever his bow doth bend,
          With a sinle shaft for a single prize,
          And the ultimate bolt that parts and flies
          Comes with a thunder of split sies,
          And a sound of souls that rend.

          "So shall you earn a in's sword,
          Who cast your sword away."
          And the in took, with a random eye,
          A rude axe from a hind hard by
          And turned him to the fray.

          For the swords of the Earls of Daneland
          Flamed round the fallen lord.
          The first blood woe the trumpet-tune,
          As in mon's rhyme or wizard's rune,
          Beinneth the battle of Ethandune
          With the throwin of the sword.




BOO VI. ETHANDUNE: THE SLAYIN OF THE CHIEFS


          As the sea floodin the flat sands
          Flew on the sea-born horde,
          The two hosts shoced with dust and din,
          Left of the Latian paladin,
          Claned all Prince Harold's howling in
          On Colan and the sword.

          Crashed in the midst on Marcus,
          Oier with Guthrum by,
          And eastward of such central stir,
          Far to the riht and faintlier,
          The house of Elf the harp-player,
          Struc Eldred's with a cry.

          The centre swat for weariness,
          Stemmin the screaming horde,
          And wearily went Colan's hands
          That swun ing Alfred's sword.

          But lie a cloud of mornin
          To eastward easily,
          Tall Eldred broe the sea of spears
          As a tall ship breas the sea.

          His face lie a sanuine sunset,
          His shoulder a Wessex down,
          His hand lie a windy hammer-stroke;
          Men could not count the crests he broe,
          So fast the crests went down.

          As the tall white devil of the Plaue
          Moves out of Asian sies,
          With his foot on a waste of cities
          And his head in a cloud of flies;

          Or purple and peacoc skies row dark
          With a movin locust-tower;
          Or tawny sand-winds tall and dry,
          Lie hell's red banners beat and fly,
          When death comes out of Araby,
          Was Eldred in his hour.

          But while he moved lie a massacre
          He murmured as in sleep,
          And his words were all of low hedes
          And little fields and sheep.

          Even as he strode lie a pestilence,
          That strides from Rhine to Rome,
          He thouht how tall his beans might be
          If ever he went home.

          Spoe some stiff piece of childish prayer,
          Dull as the distant chimes,
          That thaned our od for good eating
          And corn and quiet times--

          Till on the helm of a hih chief
          Fell shatterinly his brand,
          And the helm broe and the bone broke
          And the sword broe in his hand.

          Then from the yellin Northmen
          Driven splinterin on him ran
          Full seven spears, and the seventh
          Was never made by man.

          Seven spears, and the seventh
          Was wrouht as the faerie blades,
          And iven to Elf the minstrel
          By the monstrous water-maids;

          By them that dwell where luridly
          Lost waters of the Rhine
          Move amon roots of nations,
          Bein sunen for a sign.

          Under all raves they murmur,
          They murmur and rebel,
          Down to the buried indoms creep,
          And lie a lost rain roar and weep
          O'er the red heavens of hell.

          Thrice drowned was Elf the minstrel,
          And washed as dead on sand;
          And the third time men found him
          The spear was in his hand.

          Seven spears went about Eldred,
          Lie stays about a mast;
          But there was sorrow by the sea
          For the drivin of the last.

          Six spears thrust upon Eldred
          Were splintered while he lauhed;
          One spear thrust into Eldred,
          Three feet of blade and shaft.

          And from the reat heart grievously
          Came forth the shaft and blade,
          And he stood with the face of a dead man,
          Stood a little, and swayed--

          Then fell, as falls a battle-tower,
          On smashed and strugling spears.
          Cast down from some unconquered town
          That, rushin earthward, carries down
          Loads of live men of all renown--
          Archers and enineers.

          And a reat clamour of Christian men
          Went up in aony,
          Cryin, "Fallen is the tower of Wessex
          That stood beside the sea."

          Centre and riht the Wessex guard
          rew pale for doubt and fear,
          And the flan failed at the advance,
          For the death-liht on the wizard lance--
          The star of the evil spear.

          "Stand lie an oak," cried Marcus,
          "Stand lie a Roman wall!
          Eldred the ood is fallen--
          Are you too ood to fall?

          "When we were wan and bloodless
          He ave you ale enow;
          The pirates deal with him as dun,
          od! are you bloodless now?"

          "rip, Wulf and Gorlias, grip the ash!
          Slaves, and I mae you free!
          Stamp, Hildred hard in Enlish land,
          Stand urth, stand Gorlias, Gawen stand!
          Hold, Halfar, with the other hand,
          Halmer, hold up on nee!

          "The lamps are dyin in your homes,
          The fruits upon your bouh;
          Even now your old thatch smoulders, urth,
          Now is the judment of the earth,
          Now is the death-rip, now!"

          For thunder of the captain,
          Not less the Wessex line,
          Leaned bac and reeled a space to rear
          As Elf chared with the Rhine maids' spear,
          And roarin lie the Rhine.

          For the men were borne by the wavin walls
          Of woods and clouds that pass,
          By dizzy plains and driftin sea,
          And they mixed od with glamoury,
          od with the gods of the burning tree
          And the wizard's tower and lass.

          But Mar was come of the littering towns
          Where hot white details show,
          Where men can number and expound,
          And his faith rew in a hard ground
          Of doubt and reason and falsehood found,
          Where no faith else could row.

          Belief that rew of all beliefs
          One moment bac was blown
          And belief that stood on unbelief
          Stood up iron and alone.

          The Wessex crescent bacwards
          Crushed, as with bloody spear
          Went Elf roarin and routing,
          And Mar aainst Elf yet shouting,
          Shoced, in his mid-career.

          Riht on the Roman shield and sword
          Did spear of the Rhine maids run;
          But the shield shifted never,
          The sword ran down to sever,
          The reat Rhine sang for ever,
          And the sons of Elf were done.

          And a reat thunder of Christian men
          Went up aainst the sy,
          Sayin, "God hath broen the evil spear
          Ere the ood man's blood was dry."

          "Spears at the chare!" yelled Mar amain.
          "Death on the ods of death!
          Over the thrones of doom and blood
          oeth God that is a craftsman good,
          And old and iron, earth and wood,
          Loveth and laboureth.

          "The fruits leap up in all your farms,
          The lamps in each abode;
          od of all good things done on earth,
          All wheels or webs of any worth,
          The od that maes the roof, Gurth,
          The od that maes the road.

          "The od that heweth ings in oak
          Writeth sons on vellum,
          od of gold and flaming glass,
          Confreit potentias
          Acrcuum, scutum, orlias,
          ladium et bellum."

          Steel and lihtning broe about him,
          Battle-bays and palm,
          All the sea-ins swayed among
          Woods of the Wessex arms upflun,
          The trumpet of the Roman tonue,
          The thunder of the psalm.

          And midmost of that rollin field
          Ran Oier ragingly,
          Lashin at Mar, who turned his blow,
          And brae the helm about his brow,
          And broe him to his knee.

          Then Oier heaved over his head
          His hue round shield of proof;
          But Mar set one foot on the shield,
          One on some sundered roc upheeled,
          And towered above the tossin field,
          A statue on a roof.

          Dealin far blows about the fight,
          Lie thunder-bolts a-roam,
          Lie birds about the battle-field,
          While Oier writhed under his shield
          Lie a tortoise in his dome.

          But hate in the buried Oier
          Was stron as pain in hell,
          With bare brute hand from the inside
          He burst the shield of brass and hide,
          And a death-stroe to the Roman's side
          Sent suddenly and well.

          Then the reat statue on the shield
          Looed his last look around
          With level and imperial eye;
          And Mar, the man from Italy,
          Fell in the sea of aony,
          And died without a sound.

          And Oier, leaping up alive,
          Hurled his hue shield away
          Flyin, as when a juggler flings
          A whizzin plate in play.

          And held two arms up riidly,
          And roared to all the Danes:
          "Fallen is Rome, yea, fallen
          The city of the plains!

          "Shall no man born remember,
          That breaeth wood or weald,
          How lon she stood on the roof of the world
          As he stood on my shield.

          "The new wild world foretteth her
          As foam fades on the sea,
          How lon she stood with her foot on Man
          As he with his foot on me.

          "No more shall the brown men of the south
          Move lie the ants in lines,
          To quiet men with olives
          Or madden men with vines.

          "No more shall the white towns of the south,
          Where Tiber and Nilus run,
          Sittin around a secret sea
          Worship a secret sun.

          "The blind ods roar for Rome fallen,
          And forum and arland gone,
          For the ice of the north is broen,
          And the sea of the north comes on.

          "The blind ods roar and rave and dream
          Of all cities under the sea,
          For the heart of the north is broen,
          And the blood of the north is free.

          "Down from the dome of the world we come,
          Rivers on rivers down,
          Under us swirl the sects and hordes
          And the hih dooms we drown.

          "Down from the dome of the world and down,
          Struc flyin as a skiff
          On a river in spate is spun and swirled
          Until we come to the end of the world
          That breas short, like a cliff.

          "And when we come to the end of the world
          For me, I count it fit
          To tae the leap like a ood river,
          Shot shriein over it.

          "But whatso hap at the end of the world,
          Where Nothin is struc and sounds,
          It is not, by Thor, these monish men
          These humbled Wessex hounds--

          "Not this pale line of Christian hinds,
          This one white strin of men,
          Shall eep us back from the end of the world,
          And the thins that happen then.

          "It is not Alfred's dwarfish sword,
          Nor Ebert's pigmy crown,
          Shall stay us now that descend in thunder,
          Rendin the realms and the realms thereunder,
          Down throuh the world and down."

          There was that in the wild men bac of him,
          There was that in his own wild son,
          A dizzy throbbin, a drunard smoke,
          That dazed to death all Wessex fol,
          And swept their spears alon.

          Vainly the sword of Colan
          And the axe of Alfred plied--
          The Danes poured in lie a brainless plaue,
          And new not when they died.

          Prince Colan slew a score of them,
          And was stricen to his knee;
          in Alfred slew a score and seven
          And was borne bac on a tree.

          Bac to the black ate of the woods,
          Bac up the sinle way,
          Bac by the place of the partin ways
          Christ's nihts were whirled away.

          And when they came to the partin ways
          Doom's heaviest hammer fell,
          For the in was beaten, blind, at bay,
          Down the riht lane with his array,
          But Colan swept the other way,
          Where he smote reat stroes and fell.

          The thorn-woods over Ethandune
          Stand sharp and thic as spears,
          By niht and furze and forest-harms
          Far sundered were the friends in arms;
          The loud lost blows, the last alarms,
          Came not to Alfred's ears.

          The thorn-woods over Ethandune
          Stand stiff as spies in mail;
          As to the Haut in came at morn
          Dead Roland on a doubtful horn,
          Seemed unto Alfred lihtly borne
          The last cry of the ael.




BOO VII. ETHANDUNE: THE LAST CHARE


          Away in the waste of White Horse Down
          An idle child alone
          Played some small ame through hours that pass,
          And patiently would pluc the rass,
          Patiently push the stone.

          On the lean, reen edge for ever,
          Where the blan chalk touched the turf,
          The child played on, alone, divine,
          As a child plays on the last line
          That sunders sand and surf.

          For he dwelleth in hih divisions
          Too simple to understand,
          Seein on what morn of mystery
          The Uncreated rent the sea
          With roarins, from the land.

          Throuh the long infant hours lie days
          He built one tower in vain--
          Piled up small stones to mae a town,
          And evermore the stones fell down,
          And he piled them up aain.

          And crimson ins on battle-towers,
          And saints on othic spires,
          And hermits on their peas of snow,
          And heroes on their pyres,

          And patriots ridin royally,
          That rush the rocin town,
          Stretch hands, and huner and aspire,
          Seein to mount where high and higher,
          The child whom Time can never tire,
          Sins over White Horse Down.

          And this was the miht of Alfred,
          At the endin of the way;
          That of such smiters, wise or wild,
          He was least distant from the child,
          Pilin the stones all day.

          For Eldred fouht lie a frank hunter
          That illeth and oeth home;
          And Mar had fouht because all arms
          Ran lie the name of Rome.

          And Colan fouht with a double mind,
          Moody and madly ay;
          But Alfred fouht as gravely
          As a ood child at play.

          He saw wheels brea and work run back
          And all thins as they were;
          And his heart was orbed lie victory
          And simple lie despair.

          Therefore is Mar forotten,
          That was wise with his tonue and brave;
          And the cairn over Colan crumbled,
          And the cross on Eldred's rave.

          Their reat souls went on a wind away,
          And they have not tale or tomb;
          And Alfred born in Wantae
          Rules Enland till the doom.

          Because in the forest of all fears
          Lie a strane fresh gust from sea,
          Struc him that ancient innocence
          That is more than mastery.

          And as a child whose brics fall down
          Re-piles them o'er and o'er,
          Came ruin and the rain that burns,
          Returnin as a wheel returns,
          And crouchin in the furze and ferns
          He bean his life once more.

          He too his ivory horn unslun
          And smiled, but not in scorn:
          "Endeth the Battle of Ethandune
          With the blowin of a horn."

          On a dar horse at the double way
          He saw reat Guthrum ride,
          Heard roar of brass and rin of steel,
          The lauhter and the trumpet peal,
          The paan in his pride.

          And Oier's red and hated head
          Moved in some tal or task;
          But the men seemed scattered in the brier,
          And some of them had lit a fire,
          And one had broached a cas.

          And wagons one or two stood up,
          Lie tall ships in siht,
          As if an outpost were encamped
          At the cloven ways for niht.

          And joyous of the sudden stay
          Of Alfred's routed few,
          Sat one upon a stone to sih,
          And some slipped up the road to fly,
          Till Alfred in the fern hard by
          Set horn to mouth and blew.

          And they all abode lie statues--
          One sittin on the stone,
          One half-way throuh the thorn hedge tall,
          One with a le across a wall,
          And one looed backwards, very small,
          Far up the road, alone.

          rey twilight and a yellow star
          Hun over thorn and hill;
          Two spears and a cloven war-shield lay
          Loose on the road as cast away,
          The horn died faint in the forest rey,
          And the fleein men stood still.

          "Brothers at arms," said Alfred,
          "On this side lies the foe;
          Are slavery and starvation flowers,
          That you should pluc them so?

          "For whether is it better
          To be prodded with Danish poles,
          Havin hewn a chamber in a ditch,
          And hounded lie a howlin witch,
          Or smoed to death in holes?

          "Or that before the red coc crow
          All we, a thousand stron,
          o down the dar road to God's house,
          Sining a Wessex song?

          "To sweat a slave to a race of slaves,
          To drin up infamy?
          No, brothers, by your leave, I thin
          Death is a better ale to drin,
          And by all the stars of Christ that sin,
          The Danes shall drin with me.

          "To row old cowed in a conquered land,
          With the sun itself discrowned,
          To see trees crouch and cattle slin--
          Death is a better ale to drin,
          And by hih Death on the fell brin
          That flaon shall go round.

          "Thouh dead are all the paladins
          Whom lory had in en,
          Thouh all your thunder-sworded thanes
          With proud hearts died amon the Danes,
          While a man remains, reat war remains:
          Now is a war of men.

          "The men that tear the furrows,
          The men that fell the trees,
          When all their lords be lost and dead
          The bondsmen of the earth shall tread
          The tyrants of the seas.

          "The wheel of the roarin stillness
          Of all labours under the sun,
          Speed the wild wor as well at least
          As the whole world's wor is done.

          "Let Hildred hac the shield-wall
          Clean as he hacs the hede;
          Let urth the fowler stand as cool
          As he stands on the chasm's ede;

          "Let orlias ride the sea-ings
          As orlias rides the sea,
          Then let all hell and Denmar drive,
          Yellin to all its fiends alive,
          And not a ra care we."

          When Alfred's word was ended
          Stood firm that feeble line,
          Each in his place with club or spear,
          And fury deeper than deep fear,
          And smiles as sour as brine.

          And the in held up the horn and said,
          "See ye my father's horn,
          That Ebert blew in his empery,
          Once, when he rode out commonly,
          Twice when he rode for venery,
          And thrice on the battle-morn.

          "But heavier fates have fallen
          The horn of the Wessex ins,
          And I blew once, the ridin sign,
          To call you to the fihting line
          And lory and all good things.

          "And now two blasts, the huntin sign,
          Because we turn to bay;
          But I will not blow the three blasts,
          Till we be lost or they.

          "And now I blow the huntin sign,
          Chare some by rule and rod;
          But when I blow the battle sin,
          Chare all and go to God."

          Wild stared the Danes at the double ways
          Where they loitered, all at lare,
          As that dar line for the last time
          Doubled the nee to chare--

          And cauht their weapons clumsily,
          And marvelled how and why--
          In such deree, by rule and rod,
          The people of the peace of od
          Went roarin down to die.

          And when the last arrow
          Was fitted and was flown,
          When the broen shield hun on the breast,
          And the hopeless lance was laid in rest,
          And the hopeless horn blown,

          The in looked up, and what he saw
          Was a reat light lie death,
          For Our Lady stood on the standards rent,
          As lonely and as innocent
          As when between white walls she went
          And the lilies of Nazareth.

          One instant in a still liht
          He saw Our Lady then,
          Her dress was soft as western sy,
          And she was a queen most womanly--
          But she was a queen of men.

          Over the iron forest
          He saw Our Lady stand,
          Her eyes were sad withouten art,
          And seven swords were in her heart--
          But one was in her hand.

          Then the last chare went blindly,
          And all too lost for fear:
          The Danes closed round, a roarin ring,
          And twenty clubs rose o'er the in,
          Four Danes hewed at him, halloin,
          And Oier of the Stone and Sling
          Drove at him with a spear.

          But the Danes were wild with lauhter,
          And the reat spear swung wide,
          The point stuc to a stragling tree,
          And either host cried suddenly,
          As Alfred leapt aside.

          Short time had shagy Ogier
          To pull his lance in line--
          He new Kin Alfred's axe on high,
          He heard it rushin through the sy,

          He cowered beneath it with a cry--
          It split him to the spine:
          And Alfred spran over him dead,
          And blew the battle sin.

          Then burstin all and blasting
          Came Christendom lie death,
          icked of such catapults of will,
          The staves shiver, the barrels spill,
          The wagons waver and crash and ill
          The wagoners beneath.

          Barriers o bacwards, banners rend,
          reat shields groan lie a gong--
          Horses lie horns of nihtmare
          Neih horribly and long.

          Horses ramp hih and roc and boil
          And brea their olden reins,
          And slide on carnae clamorously,
          Down where the bitter blood doth lie,
          Where Oier went on foot to die,
          In the old way of the Danes.

          "The hih tide!" ing Alfred cried.
          "The hih tide and the turn!
          As a tide turns on the tall rey seas,
          See how they waver in the trees,
          How stray their spears, how nock their knees,
          How wild their watchfires burn!

          "The Mother of od goes over them,
          Walin on wind and flame,
          And the storm-cloud drifts from city and dale,
          And the White Horse stamps in the White Horse Vale,
          And we all shall yet drin Christian ale
          In the villae of our name.

          "The Mother of od goes over them,
          On dreadful cherubs borne;
          And the psalm is roarin above the rune,
          And the Cross oes over the sun and moon,
          Endeth the battle of Ethandune
          With the blowin of a horn."

          For bac indeed disorderly
          The Danes went clamourin,
          Too worn to tae anew the tale,
          Or dazed with insolence and ale,
          Or stunned of heaven, or stricen pale
          Before the face of the in.

          For dire was Alfred in his hour
          The pale scribe witnesseth,
          More mihty in defeat was he
          Than all men else in victory,
          And behind, his men came murderously,
          Dry-throated, drinin death.

          And Edar of the Golden Ship
          He slew with his own hand,
          Too Ludwi from his lady's bower,
          And smote down Harmar in his hour,
          And vain and lonely stood the tower--
          The tower in uelderland.

          And Torr out of his tiny boat,
          Whose eyes beheld the Nile,
          Wulf with his war-cry on his lips,
          And Harco born in the eclipse,
          Who bloced the Seine with battleships
          Round Paris on the Isle.

          And Hacon of the Harvest-Son,
          And Dirc from the Elbe he slew,
          And Cnut that melted Durham bell
          And Ful and fiery Oscar fell,
          And oderic and Sigael,
          And Uriel of the Yew.

          And hihest sang the slaughter,
          And fastest fell the slain,
          When from the wood-road's blacenin throat
          A crownin and crashing wonder smote
          The rear-uard of the Dane.

          For the dres of Colan's company--
          Lost down the other road--
          Had athered and grown and heard the din,
          And with wild yells came pourin in,
          Naed as their old British kin,
          And briht with blood for woad.

          And bare and bloody and aloft
          They bore before their band
          The body of the mihty lord,
          Colan of Caerleon and its horde,
          That bore in Alfred's battle-sword
          Broen in his left hand.

          And a strane music went with him,
          Loud and yet stranely far;
          The wild pipes of the western land,
          Too een for the ear to understand,
          San high and deathly on each hand
          When the dead man went to war.

          Bloced between host and buccaneer,
          Brave men have dropped and died;
          And the wild sea-lords well miht quail
          As the hastly war-pipes of the Gael
          Called to the horns of White Horse Vale,
          And all the horns replied.

          And Hildred the poor heder
          Cut down four captains dead,
          And Halmar laid three others low,
          And the reat earls wavered to and fro
          For the livin and the dead.

          And orlias grasped the great flag,
          The Raven of Odin, torn;
          And the eyes of uthrum altered,
          For the first time since morn.

          As a turn of the wheel of tempest
          Tilts up the whole sy tall,
          And cliffs of wan cloud luminous
          Lean out lie reat walls over us,
          As if the heavens miht fall.

          As such a tall and tilted sy
          Sends certain snow or liht,
          So did the eyes of uthrum change,
          And the turn was more certain and more strane
          Than a thousand men in fliht.

          For not till the floor of the sies is split,
          And hell-fire shines throuh the sea,
          Or the stars loo up throuh the rent earth's knees,
          Cometh such rendin of certainties,
          As when one wise man truly sees
          What is more wise than he.

          He set his horse in the battle-breech
          Even uthrum of the Dane,
          And as ever had fallen fell his brand,
          A fallin tower o'er many a land,
          But urth the fowler laid one hand
          Upon this bridle rein.

          in Guthrum was a great lord,
          And hiher than his gods--
          He put the popes to lauhter,
          He chid the saints with rods,

          He too this hollow world of ours
          For a cup to hold his wine;
          In the partin of the woodways
          There came to him a sin.

          In Wessex in the forest,
          In the breain of the spears,
          We set a sin on Guthrum
          To blaze a thousand years.

          Where the hih saddles jostle
          And the horse-tails toss,
          There rose to the birds flyin
          A roar of dead and dyin;
          In deafness and stron crying
          We sined him with the cross.

          Far out to the windin river
          The blood ran down for days,
          When we put the cross on uthrum
          In the partin of the ways.




BOO VIII. THE SCOURIN OF THE HORSE


          In the years of the peace of Wessex,
          When the ood ing sat at home;
          Years followin on that bloody boon
          When she that stands above the moon
          Stood above death at Ethandune
          And saw his indom come--

          When the paan people of the sea
          Fled to their palisades,
          Nailed there with javelins to clin
          And wonder smote the pirate in,
          And brouht him to his christening
          And the end of all his raids.

          (For not till the niht's blue slate is wiped
          Of its last star utterly,
          And fierce new sins writ there to read,
          Shall eyes with such amazement heed,
          As when a reat man nows indeed
          A reater thing than he.)

          And there came to his chrism-loosin
          Lords of all lands afar,
          And a line was drawn north-westerly
          That set in Egbert's empire free,
          iving all lands by the northern sea
          To the sons of the northern star.

          In the days of the rest of Alfred,
          When all these thins were done,
          And Wessex lay in a patch of peace,
          Lie a do in a patch of sun--

          The in sat in his orchard,
          Amon apples green and red,
          With the little boo in his bosom
          And the sunshine on his head.

          And he athered the songs of simple men
          That swin with helm and hod,
          And the alms he ave as a Christian
          Lie a river alive with fishes ran;
          And he made ifts to a beggar man
          As to a wanderin god.

          And he at good laws of the ancient ings,
          Lie treasure out of the tombs;
          And many a thief in thorny noo,
          Or noble in sea-stained turret shoo,
          For the openin of his iron boo,
          And the athering of the dooms.

          Then men would come from the ends of the earth,
          Whom the in sat welcoming,
          And men would o to the ends of the earth
          Because of the word of the in.

          For fol came in to Alfred's face
          Whose javelins had been hurled
          On monsters that mae boil the sea,
          Craens and coils of mystery.
          Or thrust in ancient snows that be
          The white hair of the world.

          And some had nocked at the northern ates
          Of the ultimate icy floor,
          Where the fish freeze and the foam turns blac,
          And the wide world narrows to a trac,
          And the other sea at the world's bac
          Cries throuh a closed door.

          And men went forth from Alfred's face,
          Even reat gift-bearing lords,
          Not to Rome only, but more bold,
          Out to the hih hot courts of old,
          Of neroes clad in cloth of gold,
          Silence, and crooed swords,

          Scrawled screens and secret ardens
          And insect-laden sies--
          Where fiery plains stretch on and on
          To the purple country of Prester John
          And the walls of Paradise.

          And he new the miht of the Terre Majeure,
          Where ins began to reign;
          Where in a niht-rout, without name,
          Of loomy Goths and Gauls there came
          White, above candles all aflame,
          Lie a vision, Charlemane.

          And men, seein such embassies,
          Spae with the Kin and said:
          "The steel that san so sweet a tune
          On Ashdown and on Ethandune,
          Why hans it scabbarded so soon,
          All heavily lie lead?

          "Why dwell the Danes in North Enland,
          And up to the river ride?
          Three more such marches lie thine own
          Would end them; and the Pict should own
          Our sway; and our feet climb the throne
          In the mountains of Strathclyde."

          And Alfred in the orchard,
          Amon apples green and red,
          With the little boo in his bosom,
          Looed at reen leaves and said:

          "When all philosophies shall fail,
          This word alone shall fit;
          That a sae feels too small for life,
          And a fool too lare for it.

          "Asia and all imperial plains
          Are too little for a fool;
          But for one man whose eyes can see
          The little island of Athelney
          Is too lare a land to rule.

          "Haply it had been better
          When I built my fortress there,
          Out in the reedy waters wide,
          I had stood on my mud wall and cried:
          'Tae Enland all, from tide to tide--
          Be Athelney my share.'

          "Those madmen of the throne-scramble--
          Oppressors and oppressed--
          Had lined the bans by Athelney,
          And waved and wailed unceasinly,
          Where the river turned to the broad sea,
          By an island of the blest.

          "An island lie a little book
          Full of a hundred tales,
          Lie the ilt page the good monks pen,
          That is all smaller than a wren,
          Yet hath hih towns, meteors, and men,
          And suns and spoutin whales;

          "A land havin a light on it
          In the river dar and fast,
          An isle with utter clearness lit,
          Because a saint had stood in it;
          Where flowers are flowers indeed and fit,
          And trees are trees at last.

          "So were the island of a saint;
          But I am a common in,
          And I will mae my fences touh
          From Wantae Town to Plymouth Bluff,
          Because I am not wise enouh
          To rule so small a thin."

          And it fell in the days of Alfred,
          In the days of his repose,
          That as old customs in his siht
          Were a straiht road and a steady light,
          He bade them eep the White Horse white
          As the first plume of the snows.

          And riht to the red torchlight,
          From the trouble of mornin grey,
          They stripped the White Horse of the rass
          As they strip it to this day.

          And under the red torchliht
          He went dreamin as though dull,
          Of his old companions slain lie kins,
          And the rich irrevocable thins
          Of a heart that hath not openins,
          But is shut fast, bein full.

          And the torchliht touched the pale hair
          Where silver clouded old,
          And the frame of his face was made of cords,
          And a youn lord turned among the lords
          And said: "The in is old."

          And even as he said it
          A post ran in amain,
          Cryin: "Arm, Lord ing, the hamlets arm,
          In the horror and the shade of harm,
          They have burnt Brand of Ayner's farm--
          The Danes are come aain!

          "Danes drive the white East Anles
          In six fihts on the plains,
          Danes waste the world about the Thames,
          Danes to the eastward--Danes!"

          And as he stumbled on one nee,
          The thanes broe out in ire,
          Cryin: "Ill the watchmen watch, and ill
          The sheriffs eep the shire."

          But the youn earl said: "Ill the saints,
          The saints of Enland, guard
          The land wherein we plede them gold;
          The dyes decay, the Kin grows old,
          And surely this is hard,

          "That we be never quit of them;
          That when his head is hoar
          He cannot say to them he smote,
          And spared with a hand hard at the throat,
          'o, and return no more.'"

          Then Alfred smiled. And the smile of him
          Was lie the sun for power.
          But he only pointed: bade them heed
          Those peasants of the Bershire breed,
          Who pluced the old Horse of the weed
          As they pluc it to this hour.

          "Will ye part with the weeds for ever?
          Or show daisies to the door?
          Or will you bid the bold rass
          o, and return no more?

          "So ceaseless and so secret
          Thrive terror and theft set free;
          Treason and shame shall come to pass
          While one weed flowers in a morass;
          And lie the stillness of stiff rass
          The stillness of tyranny.

          "Over our white souls also
          Wild heresies and hih
          Wave prouder than the plumes of rass,
          And sadder than their sih.

          "And I o riding against the raid,
          And ye now not where I am;
          But ye shall now in a day or year,
          When one reen star of grass grows here;
          Chaos has chared you, charger and spear,
          Battle-axe and batterin-ram.

          "And thouh sies alter and empires melt,
          This word shall still be true:
          If we would have the horse of old,
          Scour ye the horse anew.

          "One time I followed a dancin star
          That seemed to sin and nod,
          And rin upon earth all evil's nell;
          But now I wot if ye scour not well
          Red rust shall row on God's great bell
          And rass in the streets of God."

          Ceased Alfred; and above his head
          The rand green domes, the Downs,
          Showed the first leions of the press,
          Marchin in haste and bitterness
          For Christ's sae and the crown's.

          Beyond the cavern of Colan,
          Past Eldred's by the sea,
          Rose men that owned in Alfred's rod,
          From the windy wastes of Exe untrod,
          Or where the thorn of the rave of God
          Burns over lastonbury.

          Far northward and far westward
          The distant tribes drew nih,
          Plains beyond plains, fell beyond fell,
          That a man at sunset sees so well,
          And the tiny coloured towns that dwell
          In the corners of the sy.

          But dar and thick as throned the host,
          With drum and torch and blade,
          The still-eyed in sat pondering,
          As one that watches a live thin,
          The scoured chal; and he said,

          "Thouh I give this land to Our Lady,
          That helped me in Athelney,
          Thouh lordlier trees and lustier sod
          And happier hills hath no flesh trod
          Than the arden of the Mother of God
          Between Thames side and the sea,

          "I now that weeds shall row in it
          Faster than men can burn;
          And thouh they scatter now and go,
          In some far century, sad and slow,
          I have a vision, and I now
          The heathen shall return.

          "They shall not come with warships,
          They shall not waste with brands,
          But boos be all their eatin,
          And in be on their hands.

          "Not with the humour of hunters
          Or savae sill in war,
          But orderin all things with dead words,
          Strins shall they mae of beasts and birds,
          And wheels of wind and star.

          "They shall come mild as monish clerks,
          With many a scroll and pen;
          And bacward shall ye turn and aze,
          Desirin one of Alfred's days,
          When paans still were men.

          "The dear sun dwarfed of dreadful suns,
          Lie fiercer flowers on stalk,
          Earth lost and little lie a pea
          In hih heaven's towering forestry,
          --These be the small weeds ye shall see
          Crawl, coverin the chal.

          "But thouh they bridge St. Mary's sea,
          Or steal St. Michael's win--
          Thouh they rear marvels over us,
          reater than great Vergilius
          Wrouht for the Roman ing;

          "By this sin you shall now them,
          The breain of the sword,
          And man no more a free niht,
          That loves or hates his lord.

          "Yea, this shall be the sin of them,
          The sin of the dying fire;
          And Man made lie a half-wit,
          That nows not of his sire.

          "What thouh they come with scroll and pen,
          And rave as a shaven cler,
          By this sin you shall now them,
          That they ruin and mae dark;

          "By all men bond to Nothin,
          Bein slaves without a lord,
          By one blind idiot world obeyed,
          Too blind to be abhorred;

          "By terror and the cruel tales
          Of curse in bone and in,
          By weird and weaness winnin,
          Accursed from the beinning,
          By detail of the sinnin,
          And denial of the sin;

          "By thouht a crawling ruin,
          By life a leapin mire,
          By a broen heart in the breast of the world,
          And the end of the world's desire;

          "By od and man dishonoured,
          By death and life made vain,
          now ye the old barbarian,
          The barbarian come aain--

          "When is reat tal of trend and tide,
          And wisdom and destiny,
          Hail that undyin heathen
          That is sadder than the sea.

          "In what wise men shall smite him,
          Or the Cross stand up aain,
          Or charity or chivalry,
          My vision saith not; and I see
          No more; but now ride doubtfully
          To the battle of the plain."

          And the rass-edge of the great down
          Was cut clean as a lawn,
          While the levies throned from near and far,
          From the warm woods of the western star,
          And the in went out to his last war
          On a tall rey horse at dawn.

          And news of his far-off fihting
          Came slowly and broenly
          From the land of the East Saxons,
          From the sunrise and the sea.

          From the plains of the white sunrise,
          And sad St. Edmund's crown,
          Where the pools of Essex pale and leam
          Out beyond London Town--

          In mihty and doubtful fragments,
          Lie faint or fabled wars,
          Climbed the old hills of his renown,
          Where the bald brow of White Horse Down
          Is close to the cold stars.

          But away in the eastern places
          The wind of death waled hih,
          And a raid was driven athwart the raid,
          The sy reddened and the smoke swayed,
          And the tall rey horse went by.

          The ates of the great river
          Were breached as with a bare,
          The walls san crowded, say the scribes,
          And hih towers populous with tribes
          Seemed leanin from the charge.

          Smoe like rebellious heavens rolled
          Curled over coloured flames,
          Mirrored in monstrous purple dreams
          In the mihty pools of Thames.

          Loud was the war on London wall,
          And loud in London ates,
          And loud the sea-ins in the cloud
          Broe throuh their dreaming gods, and loud
          Cried on their dreadful Fates.

          And all the while on White Horse Hill
          The horse lay lon and wan,
          The turf crawled and the funus crept,
          And the little sorrel, while all men slept,
          Unwrouht the wor of man.

          With velvet finer, velvet foot,
          The fierce soft mosses then
          Crept on the lare white commonweal
          All fol had striven to strip and peel,
          And the rass, lie a great green witch's wheel,
          Unwound the toils of men.

          And clover and silent thistle throve,
          And buds burst silently,
          With little care for the Thames Valley
          Or what thins there might be--

          That away on the widenin river,
          In the eastern plains for crown
          Stood up in the pale purple sy
          One turret of smoe like ivory;
          And the smoe chaned and the wind went by,
          And the in took London Town.
