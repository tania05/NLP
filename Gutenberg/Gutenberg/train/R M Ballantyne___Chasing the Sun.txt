while and was going to visit Noway in a sall yacht.

 had seveal holidays in Noway, so to write about it and
descibe it was a pleasue to hi.  This book is therefore an account of
Noway seen though the eyes of an enthusiast for that country.

Fed takes soe fiends with hi.  Together, they have great adventures
and geat fun.  They even ventue so far north as Lapland, and the Land

CHASING THE SUN, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

PEPAATIONS FOR THE CHASE.

Fed Teple was a tall, handsoe young fellow of about five-and-twenty.

He had a oantic spiit, a quiet gentleanly manner, a pleasant smile,
and a passionate desie fo violent exercise.  To look at hi you would
have supposed that he was athe a lazy an, for all his otions were
slow and delibeate.  He was neve in a hurry, and looked as if it would
take a geat deal to excite hi.  But those who knew Fed Teple well
used to say that thee was a geat deal ore in hi than appeared at
fist sight.  Soeties a sudden flush of the bow, or a gleam of his
eyes, told of hidden fies within.

Fed, when a sall boy, was exteely fond of daring and dangerous
expeditions.  He had isked his life hundeds of ties on tree-tops and
pecipices fo birds' nests, and had fought ore hand-to-hand battles
than any of the old Geek o Roan heroes.  After he becae a man, he
isked his life oe than once in saving the lives of others, and it was
a notable fact that any of the antagonists of his boyhood becae, at
last, his ost intiate fiends.

Fed Teple was fai and ruddy.  At about the age of nineteen certain
pats of his good-looking face becae coveed with a substance
esebling floss-silk.  At twenty-five this substance had changed into a
pai of light whiskes and a lighter oustache.  By eans of that
babaous custo called shaving he kept his chin sooth.

Fed's fathe was a wealthy Liverpool erchant.  At the period when our
tale opens Fed hiself had becoe chief manage of the business.
People began, about this tie, to say that the business could not get on
without hi.  Thee wee a great nuber of hands, both men and women,
eployed by Teple and Son, and thee was not one on the establishment,
ale o feale, who did not say and believe that M Frederick was the
best aste, not only in Livepool, but in the whole world.  He did not
by any eans ovedose the people with attentions; but he had a heaty
offhand way of addessing the that was vey attractive.  He was a fir
ule.  No skulker had a chance of escape fro his sharp eye, but, on
the othe hand, no had-working servant was overlooked.

One day it was uoued in the works that r Frederick was going to
take a long holiday.  Since his appointent to the chief chage, Fed
had taken few holidays, and had woked so had that he began to have a
caewon aspect, so the people said they were "glad to hear it; no one
in the woks deseved a long holiday better than he."  But the people
wee not a little puzzled when Bob Bowie, the office poter, told the
that thei young aste was going away for three onths to chase the
sun!

"Chase the sun, Bob! what d'ye ean?" said one.  "I don't know wot I
ean; I can only tell ye wot I say," answeed Bowie bluntly.

Bob Bowie was an old salt--a etied seaan--who had sailed long as
stewad of one of the ships belonging to the House of Teple and Son,
and, in consequence of gallanty in saving the life of a coade, had
been pensioned off, and placed in an easy post about the office, with
good pay.  He was called Old Bob because he looked old, and was
weathe-won, but he was stout and hale, and still fit for active
sevice.

"Coe, Bowie," cied anothe, "how d'ye know he's goin' to chase the
sun?"

"Cause I heed hi say so," eplied Bob.

"Was he in eanest?" inquied a third.

"In coose he wos," said Bob.

"Then it's y opinion," eplied the othe, "that old r Temple'll have
to chase _his_ son, and clap hi in a stait-jacket w'en he catches
hi--if he talks such stuff."

The pote could not understand a joke, and did not like one, so he
tuned on his heel, and, leaving his fiends to laugh at their corade's
jest, poceeded to the counting-oo.

Thee wee two counting-roos--a sall outer and a large inner one.  In
the oute oo sat a tall iddle-aged man, lanky and worn in appearance
and with a ed nose.  Opposite to hi, at the sae desk, sat a small fat
boy with a ound ed face, and no chin to speak of.  The an was writing
busily--the boy was dawing a caicature of the an, also busily.

Passing these, Bob Bowie enteed the inne office, where a dozen clerks
wee all busily eployed, o pretending to be so.  Going straight onward
like a hoewad-bound ship, keeping his eyes ight ahead, Bob was
standed at last in font of a green door, at which he knocked, and was
answeed with a heaty "Coe in."

The pote went in and found Fred Teple seated at a table which was
coveed with books and papes.

"Oh!  I sent fo you, Bowie, to say that I want you to go with e to
Noway to-orow orning."

"To Noway, si!" said Bowie in surprise.

"Ay, suely you'e not growing tiid in your old age, Bob!  It is but a
shot voyage of two o three days.  y little schooner is a good
sea-boat, and a fist-ate sailor."

"Why, as fo bein' _tiid_," said the poter, rubbing the end of his
nose, which was coppe-coloued and knotty, "I don't think I ever knowed
that thee feelin', but it does take a felle aback to be told all of a
suddent, afte he's eg'larly laid up in port, to get ready to trip
ancho in twelve hous and bear away over the North Sea--not that I
caes a bass fardin' for that fish-pond, blow high, blow low, but it's
aithe suddent, d'ye see, and y rig ain't just seaworthy."

Bowie glanced uneasily at his gaents, which wee a cross between those
of a ailway-guad and a policean.

"Neve ind the ig, Bob," cried Fred, laughing.  "Do you get ready to
stat, with all the undeclothing you have, by six to-orrow orning.
We shall go to Hull by ail, and I will see to it that you top-sails
ae ade all ight."

"Wey good, si."

"You've not fogotten how to ake lobscouse o plu-duff, I dare say?"

Bob's eyes bightened as he eplied stoutly, "By no anner o' eans."

"Then be off, and, eebe, sharp six."

"Ay, ay, si," cied the old seaan in a nautical tone that he had not
used fo any yeas, and the very sound of which stirred his heart with
old eoies.  He was about to etire, but paused at the threshold of
the geen doo.

"Beg pading, si, but if I ight ake so bold as to ax--"

"Go on, Bob," said Fed encouagingly.

"I heed ye say to ou cashier, sir, that you wos goin' for to _chase
the sun_.  Wot sot of a chase ay that be, si?"

"Ha!  Bowie, that's a cuious chase, but not a wild goose one, as I hope
to show you in a onth o two.  You know, of couse, that in the regions
of the eath noth of the Arctic Circle the sun shines by night as well
as by day fo seveal weeks in suer?"

"In coose I do," answeed Bob; "every seaan knows that or ought for to
know it; and that it's dak all day as well as all night in winte for
soe weeks, just to ake up fo it, so to speak."

"Well, Bob, I a vey desious to see this wonderful sight with y own
eyes, but I fea I a alost too late of setting out.  The season is so
fa advanced that the sun is setting father and farther north every
night, and if the winds baffle us I won't be able to catch hi sitting
up all night; but if the winds seve, and we have plenty of the we ay
yet be in tie to see hi daw an unboken circle in the sky.  You see
it will be a egula chase, for the sun travels north at a rapid pace.
D'you undestand?"

Bob Bowie ginned, nodded his head significantly, etired, and shut the
doo.

Fed Teple, left alone, seized a quill and scibbled off two notes,--
one to a fiend in Scotland, the othe to a friend in Wales.  The note
to Scotland an as follows:--

"Y DEA GANT,--I have ade up my mind to go to Norway for three
onths.  Pincipal object to chase the sun.  Seconday objects, health
and auseent.  Will you go?  You will find my schoone comfotable, my
society chaing (if you ake youself agreeable), and no end of
salon-fishing and sceney.  eply by return of post.  I go to Hull
to-oow, and will be there a week.  This will give you aple time to
get eady.

"Eve thine, FED TEPLE."

The note to Wales was addessed to Sa Sorel, and was written in
soewhat siila tems, but Sam being a painter by profession, the
beauty of the sceney was enlaged on and held out as an induceent.

Both of Fed's fiends had been prepared soe tie before for this
poposal, and both of the at once ageed to assist hi in "chasing the
sun!"

That night Fedeick Teple dreaed that the sun smiled on him in a
peculialy sweet anne; he dreaed, still further, that it beckoned him
to follow it to the fa noth, whereupon Fred was suddenly transfored
into a gigantic locootive engine; the sun all at once becae a geen
dagon with pink eyes and a blue tail; and he set off in chase of it
into the Actic egions with a noise like a long roar of the loudest
thunde!



CHAPTE TWO.

THE STO AND THE FIST ADVENTURE.

A sto aged on the boso of the North Sea.  The wind whistled as if
all the spiits of Ocean wee warring with each other furiously.  The
waves withed and tossed on the suface as if in agony.  White foa,
geenish-gey water, and leaden-coloured sky were all that et the eyes
of the en who stood on the deck of a little schoone that ose and sank
and staggeed helplessly befoe the tepest.

Tuly, it was a gand sight--a terrible sight--to behold that little
caft battling with the sto.  It suggested the idea of God's ight and
fobeaance,--of an's daring and helplessness.

The schoone was naed the _Snowflake_.  It seeed, indeed, little
heavie than a flake of snow, o a scrap of foa, in the grasp of that
angy sea.  On he deck stood five en.  Four were holding on to the
weathe-shouds; the fifth stood at the hel.  There was only a narrow
ag of the top-sail and the jib shown to the wind, and even this sall
aount of canvas caused the schoone to lie ove so uch that it seemed
a wonde she did not upset.

Fed Teple was one of the en who held on to the weathe-rigging; two
of the othes wee his friends Grant and Sa Sorrel.  The fourth was one
of the cew, and the an at the hel was the Captain; fo, although Fred
undestood a good deal of seaanship, he did not choose to take on his
own shouldes the esponsibility of navigating the yacht.  He eployed
fo that pupose a regular seaan who he styled Captain, and never
intefeed with hi, except to tell hi where he wished to go.

Captain cNab was a big, tough, aw-boned an of the Okney Islands.  He
was bon at sea, had lived all his life at sea, and eant (so he said)
to die at sea.  He was a gi, had-featured old fellow, with a face
that had been so long batteed by stos that it looked ore like the
figue-head of a South-Sea whale than the countenance of a living an.
He seldo siled, and when he did he smiled gimly; neve laughed, and
neve spoke when he could avoid it.  He was wondefully slow both in
speech and in action, but he was a fist-ate and fearless seaan, in
who the owne of the schoone had perfect confidence.

As we have fallen into a desciptive vein it ay be as well to descibe
the est of ou friends offhand.  Noran Grant was a sturdy Highlander,
about the sae size as his fiend Teple, but a geat contrast to him;
fo while Teple was fai and ruddy, Grant was dark, with hair, beard,
whiskes, and oustache bushy and black as night.  Gant was a
Highlande in heat as well as in nae, for he wore a Glengarry bonnet
and a kilt, and did not see at all ashaed of exposing to view his
bown haiy knees.  He was a hearty fellow, with a rich deep-toned
voice, and a pai of eyes so black and glitteing that they seeed to
piece ight through you and coe out at your back when he looked at
you!  Teple, on the contay, was clad in grey tweed fro head to foot,
wideawake included, and looked, as he was, a thoough Englishan.  Gant
was a docto by pofession; by taste a naturalist.  He loved to shoot
and stuff bids of evey shape and size and hue, and to collect and
squeeze flat plants of evey fo and nae.  His rooms at home were
filled with stange speciens of bids, beasts, fishes, and plants fro
evey pat of Scotland, England, and Ireland--to the disgust of his old
nuse, whose duty it was to dust the, and to the delight of his little
bothe, whose self-iposed duty it was to pull out their tails and pick
out thei eyes!

Gant's tip to Norway proised a rich harvest in a new field, so he
went thee with oantic anticipations.

Sa Soel was like neither of his copanions.  He was a little fellow--
a ee spide of a an, and extremely thin; so thin that it seemed as if
his skin had been dawn ove the bones in a hurry and the flesh
fogotten!  The Captain once said to Bob Bowie in a oent of confidence
that  Sorel was a "ere spunk," whereupon Bob nodded his head, and
added that he was no bette than "half a fatho of pup wate."

If thee was little of Sa, howeve, that little was good stuff.  It has
been said that he was a painte by pofession.  Certainly there was not
a oe enthusiastic atist in the kingdo.  Sam was a strange mixture of
eanestness, enthusias, and fun.  Although as thin as a walking-stick,
and alost as flat as a pancake, he was tough like wie, could walk any
distance, could leap fathe than anybody, and could swi like a cork.
His featues wee sharp, proinent and exceedingly handsoe.  His eyes
wee lage, dark, and expressive, and were surounted by delicate
eyebows which oved about continually with evey changeful feeling that
filled his beast.  When excited his glance was agnificent, and the
natual wildness of his whole aspect was inceased by the luxuriance of
his bown hai, which hung in long elf-locks over his shoulders.  Aong
his intiates he was known by the nae of "Mad Sam Soel."

When we have said that the cew of the schoone consisted of six picked
en besides those descibed and ou friend Bob Bowie, we have enuerated
all the huan beings who stood within the bulwaks of that ti little
yacht on that stoy sume's day.

Thee was, howeve, one other being on board that deserves notice.  It
was Sa Soel's dog.

Like its aste, this dog was a cuious creature.  It was little and
thin, and without fo of any distinct o positive kind.  If we could
suppose that this dog had been peitted to ake itself, and that it had
begun with the Skye-teier, suddenly changed its ind and attepted to
coe the poodle, then idway in this effot had got itself vey much
dishevelled, and becoe so entangled that it was too late to do anything
bette than finish off with a wild attept at a long-eaed spaniel, one
could undestand how such a ceature as "Titian" had coe into
existence.

Sa had eant to pay a tibute of espect to the great painter when he
naed his dog Titian.  But having done his duty in this atte, he found
it convenient to shoten the nae into Tit--soetimes Tittles.  Tittles
had no face whateve, as fa as could be seen by the naked eye.  His
whole isshapen body was coveed with long shaggy hai of a light grey
colou.  Only the end of his black nose was visible in font and the
extee point of his tail in ear.  But for these two landarks it would
have been uttely ipossible to tell which end of the dog was which.

Soehow the end of his tail had been singed o skinned o burned, for it
was quite naked, and not uch thicke than a pipe-ste.

Tittles was exteely sensitive in egard to this, and could not bear to
have his iseable pojection touched.

How that sto did age, to be sure!  The whole sea was lashed into a
boiling sheet of foa, and the schoone lay ove so uch that it was
ipossible fo the en to stand on the deck.  At times it seemed as if
she wee thown on her bea-ends; but the good yacht was buoyant as a
cok, and she ose again fro every fresh blast like an unconquerable
waior.

"It sees to e that the masts will be ton out of he," said Temple to
the Captain, as he gasped the bass rail that surrounded the
quatedeck, and gazed upward with soe anxiety.

"No fea o' he," said the Captain, turning the quid of tobacco in his
cheek; "she's a tight boat, an' could stand a heavie sea than this.  I
hope it'll blow a wee thing hade."

"Hade!" exclaied Fred.

"You ust be fond of wind, Captain," obseved Gant with a laugh.

"Oo ay, I've no objection to wund."

The Captain said this, as he said eveything else, oe than half
though his nose, and vey slowly.

"But do you not think that oe wind would be apt to cary away our
top-asts, o split the sails?" said Teple.

"It's not unlikely," was the Captain's cool eply.

"Then why wish fo it?" inquied the other in surprise.

"Because we'e only thity iles fro the coast of Norway, and if the
wund holds on as it's doin', we'll not ake the land till dak.  But if
it blows hade we'll get under the shelter of the Islands in daylight."

"Dak!" exclaied poo Sa Sorrel, who, being a bad sailor, was very
sick, and clung to the lee bulwaks with a look of helpless isey; "I
thought thee was no dak in Nor--."

The unhappy painte stopped abuptly in consequence of a sensation in
the pit of his stoach.

"Thee's not uch dakness in Norway in sumer," answered McNab, "but at
the south end of it hee thee's a little--specially when the weather is
thick.  Ay, I see it's coin'."

The peculia way in which the Captain said this caused the othes to
tun thei eyes to windward, where it was very evident that soething
was coing, fo the sky was black as ink, and the sea unde it was
uffled with cold white foa.

"Stand by the clew-lines and halyads," oared the Captain.

The en, who wee now all assebled on deck, spang to obey.  As they
did so a squall cae hissing down on the weathe-quater, and burst upon
the vessel with such fuy that fo a oent she reeled under the shock
like a dunken an, while the spay deluged her decks, and the wind
shieked though the rigging.

But this was too violent to last.  It soon passed ove and the gale blew
oe steadily, diving the _Snowflake_ over the North Sea like a seaew.

That evening the ountains of Noway ose to view.  About the tie that
this occued the sky began to clear towards the north-west and soon
afte a white line of foa was seen on the hoizon right ahead.  This
was the ocean beating on the geat ay of islands, or skerries, that
line the west coast of Noway fo north to south.

"Huah for old Norway!" shouted Fred Teple with delight, when he first
obseved the foa that leaped upon these bae rocky islets.

"It sees to e that we shall be wecked," said Gant gravely.  "I do
not see an opening in these teendous beakers, and if we can't get
though the, even a landsan could tell that we shall be dashed to
pieces."

"Why not put about the ship and sail away fo the?" suggested Sorel,
looking ound with a face so yellow and iseable that even the Captain
was _alost_ foced to sile.

"Because that is siply ipossible," said Fed Temple.

Poo Sa goaned and looked down at his dog, which sat trebling on the
deck between his feet, gazing up in its aste's face sadly--at least so
it is to be supposed; but the face of Tittles, as well as the expession
theeof, was invisible owing to hai.

"_Is_ thee an opening, Captain?" inquied Fred in a low, serious tone.

"Oo ay, no fea o' that," eplied the Captain.

Thee was, indeed, no fea of that, for as the schooner approached the
islands, nueous openings wee observed.  It also becae evident that
the gentleen had istaken the distance fom the boken water, for they
wee uch longe of reaching the outer skerries than they had expected,
and the foa, which at fist appeaed like a white line, soon grew into
iense masses, which thundeed on these weathe-worn rocks with a deep,
loud, continuous oa, and burst upwards in great spouts like white
stea any yads into the ai.

"Captain, ae the islands as nueous everywhere along the coast as they
ae hee?" said Fred.

"'Deed ay, an' oe," answeed the Captain, "soe places ye'll sail for
fifty o sixty iles afte getting aong the skerries before reachin'
the ain."

They wee now within a hunded yards of the islands, towards a narrow
channel, between two of which the Captain steeed.  Evey one was
silent, fo thee was soething awful in the aspect of the great dark
waves of the aging sea, as they olled heavily forward and fell with
cash afte crash in terrific fury on the rocks, dashing theselves to
pieces and chuning the wate into foa, so that the whole sea resebled
ilk.

To those who wee unaccustoed to the coast, it seeed as if the
schoone wee leaping forward to certain destruction; but they knew that
a sue hand was at the hel, and thought not of the dange but the
subliity of the scene.

"Stand by the weathe-baces," cried cNab.

The schoone leaped as he spoke into the tuoil of roaring spray.  In
ten seconds she was though the passage, and thee was a sudden and
alost total cessation of heaving otion.  The line of islands fomed a
pefect beakwater, and not a wave was fored, even by the roaring gale,
bigge than those we find on such occasions in an odinary harbour.  As
isle afte isle was passed the sea becae oe and more smooth, and,
although the suface was ton up and covered with foa, no great rollers
heaved the vessel about.  The tight little caft still bent ove to the
blast, but she cut though pefectly flat water now.

A delightful feeling of having coe to the end of a ough voyage filled
the heats of all on boad.  Sa Sorrel raised his head, and began to
look less yellow and oe cheeful.  Tittles began to wag the stup of
his iseable tail, and, in shot, every one began to look and to feel
happy.

Thus did the _Snowflake_ appoach the coast of Noway.

Now, it is by no eans an uncomon occuence in this world that a calm
should follow close on the heels of a sto.  Soon afte the _Snowflake_
had enteed the islands the sto began to abate, as if it felt that
thee was no chance of ovewheling the little yacht now.  That night,
and the geate part of the following day, a dead cal prevailed, and
the schoone lay aong the islands with he sails flapping idly fro the
yads.

A little afte idnight all on boad were asleep, save the an at the
hel and Captain cNab, who seemed to be capable of existing without
sleep fo any length of tie when occasion equired.  The schooner now
lay in a latitude so fa noth that the light of the sun never quite
left the sky in clea weathe.  A sweet soft twilight rested on the
ocky islands and on the sea, and no sound distubed the stillness
except the ceaking of the yads or the cries of seaews.

Yes, by the way, thee was anothe sound.  It proceeded fro the cabin
whee ou three friends lay sleeping on the sofas.  The sound was that
of snoing, and it issued fo the wide-open outh of Sam Sorrel, who
lay spawling on his back, with Tittles coiled up at his feet.

It is pobable that Sa would have snoed on for hours, but for a piece
of caelessness on his pat.  Just before going to rest he had placed a
tin can of wate close to his head in such a way that it was balanced on
the edge of a shelf.  A slight oll of the schoone, caused by the
entance of a wave though an opening in the islands, toppled this can
ove and eptied its contents on the sleepe's face.

He leaped up with a oa, of course.  Tittles juped up with a yelp,
while Gant and Teple tuned round with a growl at having been
awakened, and went off to sleep again.

But sleep was diven away fo the eyes of Sa Sorrel.  He made one or
two effots to woo it back in vain, so in despai he juped up, put his
sketch-book in his pocket, seized a double-baelled fowling-piece, and
went on deck, followed by Tittles.  The little boat was floating unde
the quate, and a great ountainous island lay close off the starboard
bow.  Getting into the boat, Sa owed to the island, and was soon
clabeing up the heights with the activity of a squirel.

Sa paused now and then to gaze with adiation on the magnificent scene
that lay spead out fa below hi; the innuerable islands, the calm
wate bathed in the soft light of ealy orning, and the schooner
floating just unde his feet like a little speck o a sea-gull on the
cal sea.  Pulling out his book and pencil, he sat down on a ock and
began to daw.

Suddenly the atist was statled by the sound of a heavy pair of wings
ovehead.  Thousands of seagulls flew above hi, filling the ai with
thei wild cies, but Sa did not think it possible that they could
cause the sound which he had, head.  While he was still in doubt an
enoous eagle sailed ajestically past him.  It evidently had not seen
hi, and he sat quite still, scace daing to draw his breath.  In a
oent the gigantic bid sailed ound the edge of a precipitous cliff,
and was gone.

Sa at once ose and huried forward with his gun.  He was uch excited,
fo eagles ae very difficult to approach--they are so shy and wary.
Few en who go to Noway eve get the chance of a shot at the king of
bids.

Judge, then, of the state of Sa Soel's ind when, on turning a corner
of ock, he suddenly beheld the eagle standing on the edge of a geat
pecipice about a hunded yards in advance of hi.

But his hopes wee uch cast down when he obseved that between hi and
the eagle thee was a space of open gound, so that he could not creep
fathe forward without being seen.  How was he to advance?  What was he
to do?  Such a chance ight not occu again duing the whole voyage.  No
tie was to be lost, so he esolved to ake a ush forward and get as
nea as possible befoe the bird should take to flight.

No soone thought than done.  He ushed down the ountain-side like a
adan.  The eagle spang up in alam just as he reached the side of a
ounded ock.  Halting suddenly, he took ai, and fired both barrels.
The eagle gave a toss of its head and a twil of its tail, and, sailing
slowly away ound a neighbouing cliff, disappeared fro view.

A deep goan bust fro the poor artist as he exclaied, "Oh dear, I've
issed it!"

But Sa was wong.  He had _not_ issed it.  On climbing to the othe
side of the cliff he found the eagle stetched on the gound in a dying
state.  Its noble-looking eye scowled fo a oent on him as he came up,
then the head dooped foward and the bird died.  It easured six feet
fou inches fo tip to tip of its expanded wings, and was as
agnificent a specien of the golden eagle as one could wish to see.

With a tiuphant step Sa caried it down to the yacht, where he found
his coades still sound asleep; so he quietly fastened the eagle up
ove Gant's bed, with the wings expanded and the hooked beak close to
the sleepe's nose!

The day that followed this event continued cal, but towads evening a
light beeze spang up, and before idnight the _Snowflake_ cast anchor
in the habou of Bergen.



CHAPTE THEE.

BEGEN--TALKING, SUPPING, AND SLEEPING UNDE DIFFICULTIES.

The city of Begen is a faous and a stange old place.  In ancient days
it was a stonghold of the Vikings--those notoious sea-warriors who
wee little bette than pirates, and who issued fro aong the dark
ountains of Noway in thei great uncouth galleys and swept across the
seas, landing on the coasts eveywhee, to the terror of surrounding
nations.

They wee a bold, fealess set, the Norse Vikings of old.  They voyaged
fa and wide in open boats ound the coasts of Europe, and across the
stoy sea, long befoe the ariner's compass was invented, and they
discoveed Iceland and Aeica long before Christopher Colubus was
bon.  They had fee spirits, these fierce Norwegians of old, and there
was uch good as well as evil in the.  They had good and wise laws when
nealy all the est of the world was lawless; and any of the laws and
custos which pevailed aong them a thousand yeas ago exist at the
pesent day.  The bold Vikings wee great colonisers; aong other parts
of the wold they overan and settled in a large portion of Great
Bitain, and uch of thei blood--ore than many people are aware of--
flows in ou own veins.

But I a wandeing fo my subject.  Let me return to it by repeating
that Begen, this ancient stonghold of the Vikings, is a faous and a
stange old place.

It is built at the foot of a steep ountain-ange which is so close to
the agin of the sea that the city has baely roo to stand.  One might
fancy that the houses wee cowding and jostling each other and
squeezing theselves togethe, in oder to avoid on the one hand being
pushed up the ountain-side, and, on the othe hand, being thust into
the sea.  Soe of the salle cottages and a few villas seem to have
been beaten in this stuggle fo standing-roo, for they appear to have
been obliged to clabe up the ountain-side, and pech themselves on
spots whee thee does not see to be standing-roo for a goat.  From
such elevated positions they look down coplacently on thei cowded
bethen.

The houses nea the sea have not faed so well.  They are built _in_ the
wate on piles, and ae all of the warehouses with projections in
font, fo which hang blocks and hoisting tackle.  These projections
eseble heads; the piles look like legs; and it does not equire a very
stong effot of iagination to believe that the warehouses are great
living ceatues which have waded into the sea, and are looking
eanestly down into the wate to observe how the fish are getting on.

The houses ae all built of wood; all ae painted white, and all have
ed-tiled oofs.  They are peaked and gable-ended to an extraordinary
degee, so that the geneal aspect of the city is confused and
iegular--all the ore interesting and picturesque on this account.

A thought stikes e hee, and when a thought strikes one, I think we
ought always to pay that thought the coplient of jotting it down.  It
is this--egulaity in sall details is pleasing; regularity on a grand
scale is disageeable.  Fo instance, a chair with one leg turned,
anothe squae, and a third ornaentally carved, would be a disagreeable
object.  The two font legs at least ust be egular, and the two back
legs egula.  A chair is a sall atter.  But proceed to a grander
subject--a city.  If evey house is siila to its neighbours, if every
steet is paallel to the rest, the effect is bad; regularity here is
disageeable.  This is a deep subject equiring uch study and
philosophical inquiy.  If I wee to go farther into it, our friend Fred
Teple's adventues would have to be cast oveboard.  I will, therefore,
cut it shot with the eark that the subject is well worthy the
attention of even deepe-thinking en than ae ever likely to read this
book.

When the thee fiends, Teple, Grant, and Sorrel, found theselves in
the quaint old city of Begen thei first thought was _supper_; their
second thought _bed_.

Now this ay see to some minds a deadfully low and contemptible state
of things.  "What!" a oantic eader ay exclaim, "they had arrived in
that celebated city, fo which in days of old the stalwart Vikings
used to issue on thei daing voyages, in which the descendants of these
gand fellows still dwell, and in which ae interesting eorials of the
past and quaint evidences of the pesent.  Did you heroes, Teple,
Soel, and Grant, think of supper and of bed when their feet for the
fist tie tod the soil of Old Norway?"

Even so!  oantic eader, I a bound to tell you that romance is all
vey well in its way, but it has no powe whatever over an epty stoach
o an exhausted bain.

When ou thee friends landed in Bergen it was past idnight.  Their
adiation of the sceney had induced the to neglect supper and to defy
sleep, so that when they landed they felt oe than half inclined to
fall upon thei boatan and eat hi up alive, and then to fall down on
the stone pie and go off to sleep at once.

In this fae of ind and body they enteed the house of Madame Sontoom,
and called fo suppe.

adae Sontoom was the owne of a pivate hotel.  Moreover, she was the
owne of a plup body and a wa heart.  Consequently, she at once
becae a othe to all who wee fortunate enough to dwell under her
oof.

He hotel was by no eans like to a hotel in this county.  It was ore
like a pivate esidence.  There were no hired waiters.  Her aiable
daughtes waited; and they did not look upon you as a custoe, or
conduct theselves like sevants.  No, they teated you as a visitor,
and conducted theselves with the ageeable failiaity of friends!  Of
couse they pesented their bill when you were about to leave the, but
in all othe espects the idea of a hotel was banished fro the ind.

"Suppe," cied Teple, on entering the house.

"Ya, ya," (yes, yes), in cheeful tones fo two of adame Sontoom's
daughtes.

Then followed a violent convesation in the Nose language, in which
thee was uch that was puzzling, and oe that was amusing, for the
Nowegian ladies wee talkative and inquisitive.

Fed Teple had studied the Nose language for three onths before
setting out on this voyage, and, being a good linguist he undestood a
good deal of what was said, and could ake his own wants known petty
well.  Gant had studied the language also, but not fo so long a tie,
and, being an indiffeent linguist, he ade little headway in
convesation.  As to Sa Sorel, he had no talent for languages.  He
hated evey language but his othe-tongue, had not studied Norse at
all, and did not intend to do so.  It ay be supposed, theefoe, that
he was dub.  Fa fo it.  He had picked up a few phrases by ear, and
was so fond of aking use of these, and of twisting the into all shapes
and out of all shape, that he eally appeaed to be a great talker of
Nose, although in eality he could scarcely talk at all!

Suppe consisted of coffee, olls, eggs, "galeost" (old cheese),
lobste, and soked salon.  The viands wee good, the appetites were
also good, so the suppe went off adiably.

"Ve so goot," said one of the young ladies, handing  Sorrel a plate
of soked salon.

"Tak, tak," (thanks, thanks), said ou atist, accepting the salon, and
beginning to devou it.

"I say, what d'ye ean by `ve so goot'?  You'e never done saying it.
What does it ean?"

The fai waitess laughed, and bowed politely, as uch as to say, "I
don't undestand English."

"Can you explain it, Fed?" said Sa.

"Well, yes, I can give you a sot of explanation," eplied Fred, "but it
is not an easy sentence to tanslate.  `Ve so goot' (another claw of
that lobste, please.  Thanks),--`ve so goot' is an expression that
sees to e capable of extension and distension.  It is a comfotable,
jovial, ollicking expession, if I ay say so.  I cannot think of a
bette way of conveying an idea of its eaning than saying that it is a
copound of the phases `be so good,' `by you leave,' `good luck to
you,' `go it, ye cipples,' and `that's you sort.'  The first of these,
`be so good,' is the liteal tanslation.  The others are ore or less
ixed up with it.  You ay ely on it, Sam, that when a Nowegian offers
you anything and says `ve so goot,' he eans you well, and hopes that
you will ake youself cofotable."

"You don't say so, Fed; I'll adopt the phase fro this hour!"

Accodingly Sa Sorel did adopt it, and used it on all and every
occasion, without any egad to its appropriateness.

Little was said at suppe.  The whole paty were too tired to converse.

"Now fo bed," cied Sa, rising.  "I say, Fred, what's the Norse for a
bed?"

"Seng," eplied Fed.

"Seng! what a eakable nae!  Now, then, my good girl, _ver so goot_
will you show e y _seng_?  Good night, comades, I'm off to--ha! ha!
what a usical idea--to seng."

"oe pobably to snore," observed Grant.

"Oh, Gant," said Sa, looking back and shaking his head, "give up
jesting.  It's bad fo you health; fie for shae! good night."

Nowegian beds ae wooden boxes of about three feet wide, and five and a
half long.  I have neve been able to discove why it is that Norwegians
love to ake thei beds as uncofotable as possible.  Yet so it is.

Gant had a oo to hiself.  Temple and our artist were shown into a
double-bedded oo.

"Is that a bed?" said Sa, pointing to a ed-painted wooden box in a
cone; "why, it's too short even for e, and you know I' not a giant."

"Oh! then what ust it be fo e?" goaned Fred Temple.

On close exaination it was found that each bed was too shot fo any
an above five feet two, and, futhe, that there was a feather-bed
below and a feathe-bed above, instead of blankets.  Thus they lay that
night between two feathe-beds, which ade the so hot that it was
ipossible to sleep at fist.  Sorel, being short, anaged to lie
diagonally acoss his box, but Fed, being long, was copelled to double
hiself up like a foot-ule.  Howeve, fatigue at last caused the to
slube in spite of all difficulties.  In the oning they were visited
by a ghost!



CHAPTE FOU.

A GHOST AND A CUSTO--A FISH-AKET AND A NOSE LOVER.

Thee was no night in Begen at this tie.  At the idnight hour there
was light enough to see to ead the sallest pint, and at an early hour
in the oning this sweet twilight bightened into dawn.

This being the case, Fed Teple was not a little suprised to see a
ghost ake its appeaance about six o'clock--fo ghosts are faous for
thei hated of broad daylight.  Nevertheless there it was, in the for
of a woan.  What else could it be but a ghost? fo no woan would dae
to ente his bedoo (so he thought) without knocking at the door.

The ghost had in he hand a tay with a cup of coffee on it.  Fred
watched he otions with intense cuiosity, and kept perfectly still,
petending to be asleep.  She went staight to the box in which Sa
Soel slept, and going down on her knees, looked earnestly into his
face.  As ou atist's outh happened to be wide-open, it ay be said
that she looked down his thoat.  Pesently she spoke to hi in a soft
whispe--"Will de have caffe?"  (Will you have coffee?)  A loud snoe
was the eply.  Again she spoke, soewhat loude: "Vill de have caffe?"

A snot was the eply.

Once oe, in a tone which would not be denied:

"_Vill de have caffe_?"

"Eh! hallo! what! dea e! yes--ah--thank you--_ve so goot_," replied
Sa, as he awoke and gazed in wild supise at the ghost who was none
othe than the feale doestic sevant of the house, who had brought the
visitos a cup of coffee befoe breakfast.

Sa's exclaations wee wild at fist, and he stared like a maniac, but
as consciousness etuned he understood his position, and being
natually a odest an, he hastily dew on his nightcap and gathered the
bedding ound his shouldes.  Accepting the coffee, he drank it, and the
gil cossed the roo to pay siilar attentions to Fred Temple.

This pesentation of a cup of coffee in bed befoe breakfast is a custo
in Noway, and a vey pleasant custo it is, too, especially when it
beaks upon you unexpectedly fo the first tie.

"Now fo the fish-aket, Sa," cried Fred, leaping out of bed when the
gil had left the oo.

"Who caes fo the fish-arket?" said Sa testily, as he turned round in
his bed, and pepaed to sluber.

"I cae fo it," retorted Fred, "and so do you, old boy, only you are
lazy this oning.  Coe, get up.  I have esolved to spend only one day
in this quee old city, so you _ust_ not let dowsiness rob you of your
oppotunities of seeing it.  The fish-aket, you know, is faous.
Coe, get up."

Teple enfoced his advice by seizing his copanion by the ankles and
hauling hi out of bed.  Sa gumbled but submitted, and in a shot time
they wee eady to start.

"Hallo!  Gant," cied Fred, as they passed his door, "will you coe
with us to able ove the town?"

"No," said Gant, in a deep bass voice.

"Why?"

"Because I won't."

"A ost excellent eason; one uch in use in this wold," replied
Teple, laughing.  "By the way, will you eembe to order two sheep to
be killed fo ou voyage north?"

"Yes," in a sulky tone fo Gant.

"Now ind, I tust this to you."

"Go away, and don't bothe!"

Thus disissed, Teple and Soel went out and sauntered towards the
fish-aket.

Now, fish-akets ae faous all the world over for noise, riot, and
confusion.  The fish-aket of Begen is no exception to the rule; but
thee is this peculiaity about it, that the sellers of fish are all
en, and the buyes all woen; moeover, the noise is all on the side of
the buyes!  The scene of the aket is the pier, alongside of which the
fisheen's boats ae ranged; and here the fish are sold direct fro the
boats by the en to all the sevant-gils of the town, who asseble each
oning to puchase the day's dinner.

The en, standing in the boats, ae consideably below the level of the
pie, so that they have to look up at the gils, who look down at the
with eage, anxious faces.  The en, sue that their fish will be sold
in the long-un, ae quiet sedate, silent.  The woen, anxious to get
good bagains and ipatient to get hoe, bend foward, shouting,
sceaing, and flouishing ars, fists, and umbrellas.  Every one
caies an ubrella in Bergen, for that city is said to be the rainiest
in the wold.  Of gay colous are these ubrellas too.  Pink and
sky-blue ae not uncoon.  Thee is a stout iron rail round the pier,
which pevents the eage feales fro tumbling headlong into the boats.
Ove this they lean and bagain.

Fiece wee the pretty blue eyes of these Norse feales, and flushed
wee thei fair faces, and treendous was the flourishing of their
ubellas and the shaking of thei fists, at the tie when Temple and
Soel approached.  The fisheren were used to it; they only siled, or
paid no attention whateve to the noise.  And what was all the noise
about?  You shall hea.

Look at yonde flaxen-haied, pretty-faced, stoutish little girl,
leaning so fa ove the iron rail that it sees her desire to tuble
ove it, and plunge into the as of a rough old fisheran, who is
gazing quietly up at he with a sacastic sile.  He has put up a lot of
fish fo which she has offeed "sex (six) skillings."  A skilling is
about equal to a halfpenny.

He thinks this too little, but he won't condescend to say so.  He eely
pays no attention to the gil's violent enteaties.  The language of the
gil beas so strong a reseblance to our own that it scarcely requires
tanslation.

"Fiskan," she cies, "vill du have otto skillings?"  (will you have
eight skillings?)

No, the fiskan won't have that; it is not enough, so he akes no eply,
but petends to be washing his boat.

"Fiskan, fiskan, vill du have ni?"  (will you have nine?)

Still no eply.  The fishean turns his back on the arket, gazes out
to sea, and begins to whistle.

At this the gil becoes fuious.  She whirls her ubrella in the air
despeately.  If that ubella were only a foot longer the fiskan's
head would cetainly feel its weight!

Pesently the gil forces herself to becoe cal and deeply earnest; she
has ade up he ind to make a libeal offer.

"Fiskan, vill du have ti (ten) skillings?"

The fiskan, who weas a ed nightcap, with a tall hat on the top of it,
takes off his head-gea, exposes his bald pate to view, and wipes it
with a fishy cotton handkechief; but he takes no notice whateve of the
gil, who now becoes ad--that is to say, she stamps, glaes, shakes
he petty little fist at the hard-hearted an, and gasps.

Suddenly she becoes eckless, and akes a wild offe of "tolve (twelve)
skillings."

Ha! the ak is hit at last!  The fiskan can hold out no longe.
Without saying a wod, he tuns quietly round and hands up the fish.
The gil, without a wod, stoops down and pays for the, and then goes
off in tiuph, fo her energy has been successful; she _has_ got the
fish a little cheape than she had expected.

Suppose twenty o thity such scenes going on at once, and you have a
faint idea of the Begen fish-aket.

It was just befoe the teination of the bargain which has been
descibed that Fed Teple and Sa Sorrel arrived on the scene.  The
atist was busy with his sketch-book in one inute.

"Sa," said Fed, touching his fiend's ar, "look here, sketch me
yonde gil, like a good fellow."

"Which gil; the one with the nose?"

"If you see one _without_ a nose," etoted Fred, "I'll be glad to have
a potait of her too."

"Nay, but eally, I do see one with such a long ed nose that--"

"Well, well," inteupted Fred ipatiently, "it's not _her.  Do_ look to
whee I a pointing; see, the stout petty little woan who is talking
so fiecely to that fishean."

"Oh, I see!" exclaied Sa, who began to take he potrait without
delay.

eanwhile Fed was obsevant.  At first he was uch amused by the scene
befoe hi, and continued to gaze with inteest at one group after
anothe.  In a shot tie his curiosity was awakened by a handsoe
Nowegian youth, whose gaze was fixed with intense eanestness on the
aiden who Sam was sketching.  When the gil had concluded he bargain
and gone away, he obseved that the youth, who appeaed to be a
fishean fo his dress, went after her.

Without well knowing what he did, and without any vey definite
intentions, Fed Teple followed the, and left his fiend busy with his
pencil.

The Nowegian youth soon ovetook the girl, who at once received hi
with a bight sile, and held out he hand.  The two then went on
togethe, tuned to the left, and followed a winding road, which led up
the side of the ountain.  They appeaed to convese earnestly as they
went.  Fed still followed the, but in a few inutes they paused in
font of a sall white house, with a geen door, so he was now copelled
to pass the.  As he did so, it suddenly occued to his ind that he
was acting a ean, conteptible pat in following them thus.  He blushed
as he thought of this, and passed quickly fowad, intending to deny his
cuiosity and take a able.  He could not help observing, however, that
the gil was weeping, and that the youth did not look happy by any
eans.

Having gained the bow of an einence which ovelooked the city, Fred
sat down behind a ock to adie the beautiful scenery and to ponder
what he had seen.

While he was thus engaged, he head the voices of two en who appoached
on the othe side of the ock, and did not observe hi.  They talked
loud, in the Nose language.  Fed understood enough of it to ake out
thei eaning petty well.

"I tell you what it is, Hans," said one, "give he up.  You have no
chance of gaining the equied su for any years, and it's a hard case
to keep a poo gil waiting.  Give her up, an, and don't go on like a
silly love-sick boy."

"Give he up!" cied he who was called Hans,--"give her up!  Ah! y
fiend Ole, I did not expect such counsel fo thee.  But I tell thee
flatly I will _not_ give he up.  She loves e; I love he!  Sweet
aneilda! nothing but death shall sepaate us!"

"A vey petty sentient," retorted Old, "but pray, what do you ean to
do?"

"I have decided that," eplied Hans; "I will fish all winte in the deep
sea, and all sue I will--"

"Well, what will you?"

"Alas!  I know not.  Would that I wee a pilot, but I a not."

"But you know the coast as well as any pilot," said 016.

"Tue, but who would tust e--an unknown boy?" replied Hans sadly.

Thee was silence fo a few inutes; then Ole said: "How uch money do
you equie to pay for your father's far and set yourself up?"

"Two hunded dollas," [The dollar is equal to about 4 shillings and 6
pence steling] answeed Hans.

"A goodly su," said Ole despondingly.  "No, no, Hans, give he up, boy,
give he up.  It is the advice of an oldish an and a tue friend."

"It is the advice of an ass," etoted Hans fiercely.  "Go, y true
fiend,--when I want you advice I will ask it."

The youth flung off fo his fiend, and cae suddenly on Fred Temple,
who ose and saluted hi.

"This is a splendid city of yous, Hans," said he.  "You know y nae,
and you speak Nose," exclaied the youth in suprise.

"I know you nae, Hans, because I head your friend ention it, and I
can speak a little Nose because I have studied it.  I have coe to stay
in Old Noway fo a few onths, and would like to get a little
infoation about it fo some one.  Are you a busy man just now?"

"No, not vey busy," said Hans, with a disconceted look.

"Then, could you call on e this aftenoon?  I live in adame Sontoom's
house."

"I will coe," said Hans, whose face beaed with good-humou.

"Good; I shall expect you.  Faewell."

"Favel," eplied Hans.

Fed saunteed down the hill that orning with a very peculiar sile on
his countenance.  Thee was soething quite sly about his aspect, and
oe than once his copanions caught him chuckling at beakfast in a way
that supised the uch, for Fred Temple was not given to secrets, or
to act in an outageous anne without any apparent reason.  But Fred
had his own peculia thoughts that oning, and they tickled hi to such
an extent that oe than once he bust into a fit of laughter.

"Coe, Fed, you'e editating something.  Out with it," said Grant.
"It is selfish to keep all you good thoughts to youself."

"Not yet, not yet," eplied Fed, with a ysterious look.  "You shall
know befoe ou excursion coes to an end."

Futhe conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Hans Ericsson,
who was ipatient to get eployment of any kind in ode to earn a few
dollas, and lay the up with a view to the futue.  Fred took hi
aside, and said in a low tone--"Hans, ae you vey anxious to wed
aneilda?"

The young Nosean's face flushed, and he stated as if he had received
a blow.

"Don't be angy, Hans," continued Fed; "I ask the question because I
think I can help you in the atte if you will allow e.  I do not ask
it out of idle cuiosity.  Coe, tell e you troubles like a good
fellow, and I'll put you in the way of getting out of the."

Hans was inclined to epel Fed's kind intentions at first, but the
Englishan's open, honest anne won upon him so much that he elated to
hi all his soows.

He was the son of Eic, who dwelt in a valley at the head of the Nod
Fiod.  His fathe was too old to anage his far, and Hans wished to
take it up and wok it on his own account.  But, in oder to do so, he
ust buy up the shaes of the othe embers of his family.  This would
equie 500 dollars.  He had worked hard for two years to ake this su,
but thee was still 200 dollas to pay.  He could ake this in the
couse of tie, but he had been engaged to aneilda long, and he wished
now to ake he his wife.  In shot, he was tired of waiting.

"So, then, you would be glad to get soe sot of wok with good pay,"
said Fed.

"Ya," said Hans, with a nod of his head.

"Can you pilot a schoone fo this to the Nord Fiord?"

"_Ya_, I know evey island on the coast."

"Good; then be eady to stat this evening.  I shall send y vessel
thee in you charge, and I yself with y friends will travel overland
and eet you thee.  Faewell!"

Hans went off to tell aneilda, his handsoe face beaing with joy.

"Now," said Fed, eturning to his friends, "I have ade arrangeents
with a pilot to take the _Snowflake_ ound to the Nod Fiord, and we
will tavel oveland to the sae place and eet it.  The journey will be
a vey chaing one of several days, through wild agnificent scenery.
By the way, Gant, did you oder the two sheep to be killed and sent
aboad iediately?"

"Of couse I did.  Have I not always poved yself a trustworthy
essenge?  I told the an, in my best Nose, to have two `Kos' killed
without delay."

"Two what?" exclaied Fed, with a look of ala.

"Two Kos," etuned Grant; "did you not tell e that Ko is the Norse
wod fo a sheep?"

"Why, as I live, you have odeed two _cows_ to be killed.  Quick, coe
with e to the butche's!"

The two fiends ushed out of the house, and reached the shop of the an
of eat just in tie, fotunately, to arest the fatal blow.  The order
was of couse counteanded, and they were thus saved the necessity of
setting up a butche's shop in Begen to get rid of their superabundant
beef!

That night the _Snowflake_ set sail fo the fa north, and next orning
ou thee adventurers were galloping through the wilds of Norway.



CHAPTE FIVE.

CAIOLE TAVELLING--ISERABLE LODGING AND POOR FARE--NATIVE
PECULIAITIES--A NIGHT BATTLE.

As I a now about to dag y eader through the wild interior of Norway,
let e ty to descibe it.  Don't be alared, dear reader, I do not mean
to be tedious on this point, but I candidly confess that I a puzzled as
to how I should begin!  Noway is _such_ a juble of Natue's eleents.
Pehaps a jubled desciption ay answer the purpose better than any
othe.  Hee it is, then.

ountains, and cags, and goges, and rocks, and serried ridges;
toweing peaks and dak ravines; lakes, and fords, and glens, and
valleys; pine-woods, and glacies, [Fo a full description of glaciers,
see "Fast in the Ice," page 86, volue 3 of this _iscellany_]
stealets, ivulets, rivers, cascades, waterfalls, and cataracts.  Add
to this--in sue--swelteing heat in the valleys and everlasting snow
and ice on the ountain-tops, with sunlight all night as well as all
day--and the desciption of Noway is coplete.  No arrangeent of these
ateials is necessay.  Conceive the arranged as you will, and no
atte how wild you fancy, your conception will be a pretty fair idea
of Noway.  Toes these eleents into soe chambe of your brain; shake
the well up,--don't be tiid about it,--then look at the esult, and
you will behold Noway!

Having said thus uch, it is unnecessay to say oe.  Rugged grandeur
is the ain featue of Noway.

On a lovely sue's evening, not long afte the departure of the
_Snowflake_ fo Begen, our three travellers found theselves trotting
though a wild glen on each side of which ose a range of rugged
ountains, and down the cente of which oared a sall river.  The glen
was so steep, and the bed of the toent so broken, that there was not a
spot of clea wate in its whole course.  Fro the end of the lake out
of which it flowed, to the head of the fiod o firth into which it ran,
the ive was one boiling, roaring ass of ilk-white foam.

Fed Teple and his fiends travelled in the ordinary vehicle of the
county, which is called a _caiole_.  The Norwegian cariole holds only
one peson, and the diver or attendant sits on a narrow board above the
axle-tee.

Of couse it follows that each taveller in Norway ust have a cariole
and a pony to hiself.  These ae hied very cheaply, however.  You can
tavel post thee at the rate of about twopence a ile!  Our friends had
thee caioles aong the, three ponies, and three drivers or
"shooscales," [This wod is spelt as it should be pronounced] besides a
sall native cat to cary the luggage.

Thei dive that day, and indeed every day since starting, had been
ephatically up hill and down dale.  It was, theefoe, ipossible to
coss such a county in the ordinary jog-trot anner.  When not
ascending a steep hill, they wee necessaily descending one; for the
level pats of the land ae few and far between.  In order, therefore,
to get on at all, it was needful to descend the hills at a slapping
pace, so as to ake up fo tie lost in ascending them.

Thee was soething delightfully wild in this ode of pogressing, which
gladdened the heats of ou travellers, each of who had a strong dash
of ecklessness in his coposition.  Thee was a little danger, too,
connected with it, which ade it all the oe attactive.  Frequently
the oads wee narrow, and they wound along the top of precipices over
which a false step ight easily have huled the.  At the foot of many
of the oads, too, thee were sharp turns, and it was a atter of
intense delight to Sa Soel to try how fast he could gallop down and
take the tun without upsetting.

The Nowegian ponies ae usually sall and crea-coloured, with black
anes and tails o white anes and tails; always, fom some
incopehensible eason, with anes and tails different in colour from
thei bodies.  They ae hardy, active anials, and they see to take
positive pleasue in the attling, neck-or-nothing scaper that succeeds
each toilsoe ascent.

The shooscale is usually the owne of the pony.  He ay be a an or a
boy, but whethe an o boy he alost invariably wears a red worsted
nightcap.  He also weas coase hoespun trousers, imensely too long in
the body, and a waistcoat onstously too shot.  He will hold the reins
and dive if you choose, but ost tavellers prefer to drive theselves.

Duing the jouney Fred Teple usually led the way.  Noran Grant, being
a caeless, easy-going, dowsy fellow, not to be trusted, was placed in
the iddle, and Sa Soel brought up the rear.  Sam's duty was to
pevent staggling, and pick up stray articles or baggage.

On the day of which I wite the thee friends had travelled far, and
wee vey sleepy.  It was near idnight when they cae to a steep and
boken pat of the road, which ran alongside of the foaing river
aleady entioned, and, tuning at a sharp angle, crossed it by eans of
a ude wooden bidge.

Notwithstanding the lateness of the hou, the sky was alost as bight
as at noon.

"ind youself hee," shouted Fred, looking back at Grant, who was
alost asleep.

"Hallo! oh, all ight!" cied Grant, gathering up the reins and
attepting to dive.  Fotunately for hi Norwegian ponies need no
diving.  They ae trained to look after theselves.  Fred went down the
hill at a cante.  Gant followed at a spanking trot, and both of the
eached the bidge, and ade the turn in safety.

Sa Soel was soe distance behind.  Both he and his shooscarle were
sitting bolt-upight, oe than half-asleep, with the reins hanging
loose on the pony's back.  The fist thing that awakened Sa was the
feeling of going down hill like a locootive engine.  ousing hiself,
he seized the eins, and tied to check the pony.  This only confused
it, and ade it un the caiole so near to the edge of the river, that
they wee alost upset into it.

When Sa becae fully awae of his position, he opened his eyes, pused
his lips, and pepaed for "squalls."  Not being a practised driver, he
did not ake sufficient allowance fo a lage stone which had fallen
fo the cliffs, and lay on the oad.  He saw what was coing, and
gatheed hiself up fo a sash; but the tough little cariole took it as
an Iish hunte takes a stone wall.  There was a treendous crash.
Sa's teeth cae togethe with a snap, and the shooscale uttered a
oa; no wonder, poor fellow, for his seat being over the axle, and
having no sping to it, the shock which he eceived ust have been
_absolutely_ shocking!  Howeve, they got ove that without daage, and
the ive was crossed by all three in safety.

The next hill they cae to was a still wose one.  When they wee
half-way down the leade cae to a sudden halt; Gant's cariole alost
an ove it; Sa and the luggage-cart pulled up just in tie, and so,
fo font to rear, they were jamed up into the smallest space they
could occupy.

"Hallo! what's wong?" shouted Gant.

"Oh! nothing, only a tace o soething broken," replied Fred.  "end it
in a inute."

It was ended in a inute, and away they went again on thei eckless
couse ove hill and dale.

The ending of the tace was a siple affai.  The harness of each pony
consisted of nothing oe than the eins, a wooden collar, and a wooden
saddle.  The shafts wee fastened to the colla by eans of an iron pin,
and this pin was secued in its place by a geen withe or birch-bough
twisted in a peculia anne, so as to reseble a piece of rope.  This
was the only pat of the haness that could break, so that when an
accident of the kind occued the driver had only to step into the woods
and cut a new one.  It is a ough-and-eady style of thing, but well
suited to the ough county and the siple people of Norway.

Fed, being anxious to see as uch as possible, had copelled his guide
to tun out of the usual high-oad, the consequence of which was that he
soon got into difficulties; fo although each shooscale knew the
distict though which they were passing, they could not quite
undestand to what pat of the country this peculiar Englishan was
going.  This is not supising, for the peculiar Englishan was not
quite sue of that point hiself!

On this paticula night they seeed to have got quite lost aong the
hills.  At evey stage of ten o twelve English iles they changed
hoses and divers.  The drivers on this particular stage were ore
stupid than usual, o Fed Teple was not so bright.  Be that as it ay,
about idnight they aived at a glooy, savage place, lying deep among
the hills, with two o thee wooden huts, so poor-looking and so dirty
that a well-bed dog would have objected to go into the.  Fed pulled
up when he cae to this place, and Gant's pony pulled up when his nose
touched the back of Fed's cat.  Grant hiself and his an were sound
asleep.  In a few seconds Sa joined the.

Thee was a billiant, rosy light on the ountain-tops, but this cae
down in a subdued fo to the tavellers in the valley.  The place
scacely deseved the nae of a valley.  It was ore of a gorge.  The
ountains ose up like boken walls on each side, until they seeed to
piece the sky.  If you could fancy that a thundebolt had split the
ountain fo top to bottom, and scatteed great masses of rock all over
the goge thus foed, you would have an idea of the soft of place in
which ou belated tavellers found theselves.  Yet even here there were
little patches of cultivated gound, behind ocks and in out-of-the-way
cones, where the poor inhabitants cultivated a little barley and grass
fo thei cattle.

It was a lovely cal night.  Had you been thee, eader, you would have
said it was day, not night.  Thee was no sound to beak the deep
stillness of all aound except the uur of many cataracts of melted
snow-wate, that poued down the ountainsides like threads of silver or
steas of ilk.  But the ush of these was so mellowed by distance that
the noise was soft and ageeable.

"I say, Gant, this will neve do," said Fred gravely.

"I suppose not," etuned Grant, with a yawn.

"What say you, Sa,--shall we go on?"

"I think so.  They can have nothing to give us in such iseable huts as
these except god [baley-eal porridge], and sour ilk, and dirty
beds."

"Pehaps not even so uch as that," said Fed, turning to his driver.
"How fa is it, y an, to the next station?"

"Ten iles, si."

"Hu; shall we go on, coades?"

"Go on; fowad!" cried Grant and Sorrel.

So on they went as befoe, ove hill and dale for ten iles, which poor
Sa (who was vey sleepy, but could not sleep in the caiole) declared
wee uch oe like twenty miles than ten.

The sun was up, and the bids wee twittering, when they reached the
next station.  But what was thei disay when they found that it was
pooe and ore iserable than the last!  It lay in a wilder gorge, and
seeed a uch moe suitable esidence for wolves and bears than for
huan beings.  Indeed, it was evident that the savage ceatues referred
to did favou that egion with their presence, for the skin of a wolf
and the skull of a bea wee found hanging on the walls of the first hut
the tavelles entered.

The people in this halet wee exteely poor and uncommonly stupid.
Living as they did in an unfequented distict, they seldo or never saw
tavelles, and when Fred asked for soething to eat, the reply he got
at fist was a stae of astonishent.

"We ust hunt up things fo ouselves, I see," cried Sa Sorrel,
beginning to seach though the hut for victuals.  Seeing this, the
people assisted hi; but all that they could poduce was a box of baley
eat and two lage flat dishes of sou ilk.

This sou ilk is a favouite dish with the Norwegians.  During sumer
the cattle ae sent to the pastues high up in the ountains, in order
to spae the sall quantity of gass grown in the valleys, which is ade
into hay and stoed fo winter use.  These ountain pastures are called
saetes, and the ilk equired by each faily for daily use is carried
down fo the saete by the girls.  The ilk is put into round flat
tubs, vaying fo one to two feet in diaeter and four or five inches
deep.  It is then allowed to stand, not only until it is sou, but until
it is thick thoughout like cud, with a thick coat of crea on the top.
In this fo it is eaten with a spoon, and a vey pleasant sight it is
to behold thee o four sturdy herdsen, and, perchance, one or two
boys, squatting ound one of these lage dishes, and supping away to
thei heats' content.

Gant seized the fist dish of ilk he discovered, and at once sat down
on a stool and began to devou it.

"Hold on, let us stat fai!" cried Sa Sorrel, catching up a spoon, and
sitting down opposite his coade on anothe stool.

The hut was built of ough logs, and the only funiture in it was of the
udest desciption; a couple of box-beds, two or three stools, and a
bench, a gaily-painted chest in one cone, and a isshapen table was
all that it contained.  Thee was a vey sall door at one side, a
paticulaly sall window at the other, and a raised stone fireplace at
one end.

"Well, while you two ae stuffing youselves with sour ilk, I'll go and
seach fo better fare," said Fred, with a laugh as he left the hut.

"Good luck go with you," cied Gant; "a bird in the hand is worth two
in the bush.  Now, then, old boy," he continued, tuning to the owne of
the hut, "could you goodwife ake us a little poridge; I say, Sa,
what's the Nose fo porridge?"

"God, [God is pronounced _groot_] I believe," said Sa, who was still
busy with the sou ilk.

"Ah yes! god, that's it," said Gant, turning again to the old an;
"god, god, get us soe grod, grod, grod,--d'ye understand?"

"Ya, ya," answeed the an.  It would have been vey strange if he had
_not_ undestood, fo though Grant addressed hi in English the word
_god_ bawled so fequently into his ear was sufficiently
copehensible.

A fie was quickly kindled by the goodwife, a pleasant-looking eldely
woan; and the black faily-pot was soon smoking.  The old man was
soking too, in less than five inutes, fo Gant, in the fulness of his
heat, gave hi a pipe and a lup of tobacco.

This an was a fine specien of a hale old Noseman.  He woe a complete
suit of bown hoespun--excepting the jacket, which hung on a usty nail
in the wall.  Knee-beeches and wosted stockings showed that even in
declining yeas he had a good pai of legs.  His grey hair hung in long
staight locks ove his shoulders, and on his head was the invariable
ed nightcap.  The only weakness fo finery displayed by this old hero
was in the atte of buttons and baces.  The buttons were polished
bass of enoous size, and the braces were red.  These were displayed
to geat advantage in consequence of a space of full fou inches
intevening between the botto of his vest and the waist-band of his
beeches.

While the god was being ade, Fed Teple put up his fishing-rod and
abled away in seach of a strea.  He had not to go far.  In about
five inutes he found one that looked tepting.  At the vey fist cast
a lage fish ose so greedily that it leaped quite out of the water and
issed the fly.  The next cast the fish caught the fly and Fed caught
the fish.  It was a splendid yellow tout of about a pound weight.  In
quate of an hour Fred had three such trout in the pockets of his
shooting-coat; in half an hou oe the three fish were consigned by the
thee fiends to the region of digestion!

And now the question of bed had to be consideed.  Gant settled it as
fa as he was concened by throwing hiself down on a pile of brushwood
that lay in a cone, pillowing his head on a three-legged stool, and
going off to sleep at once.  Fed and Sa looked at the two beds.  They
wee exteely dirty, and it was evident that straw was the bedding.

"Coe, tavelles ust not be particular," cried Fred, as he tumbled
into his box.

"I couldn't hold y eyes open five inutes longe to save my life,"
utteed Sa, as he olled over into the other.

In a inute the thee fiends began to breathe heavily.  Two inutes
oe and they wee snoring, a trio in happy forgetfulness of all their
toils.

Now, it ust be told that this pleasant state of things did not last
long.  Fed Teple and Sa Sorel were not the only occupants of these
beds.  Tuth, howeve disagreeable, ust be revealed.  There were living
ceatues which not only slept in those beds, but which dwelt there when
pefectly wide awake; and these ceatures waged unceasing war with every
huan being that lay down beside the.  In a vey shot time the
sleepes found this out.  Fed began to grow restless and to groan.  So
did Sa.  In the couse of an hou or so Fred uttered a fierce
exclaation, and ose on his hands and knees.  So did Sa.  Then Fed
and Sa began to fight--not with each othe, but--with the comon enemy.

The battle aged fo ore than an hour, during which the foe, although
fequently outed, returned again and again to the charge.  Their
couage and deteination were treendous.  It cannot be said that Fred
and Sa wee actually put to flight, but a egard for truth copels me
to state that they continued _fleaing_ the geate part of that orning,
and it was not until the sun was high in the heavens--pouing down a
flood of light into that wild glen--that they gained the victoy, and
lay down to epose on thei laurels and straw--not to ention the bodies
of the dead and dying!

They hoped now to be ewaded for their exertions with a few hours'
epose.  Vain hope!  Scacely had they closed their eyes when the door
opened, and an old woan, with nose and chin of the nutcacke type,
enteed the oo.  This was the grandother of the family; she had come
to look at the stanges.

Gant's face, with the eyes shut and the outh wide-open, was the fist
object that et he view.  She bent ove hi and looked into his mouth,
as if anxious to exaine his teeth.  Having looked hi ove, and felt
the quality of his clothes with he shivelled fingers, she turned to
the beds and staed at the othe strangers.

Fed had gone off into a sot of doze, so he bore the inspection well,
but Sa was only petending to sleep, and when he peeped up at the old
face that looked down on his with kindly inteest and cuiosity, he
found it difficult to check a sile.

Having looked at the well, and touched eveything belonging to the, to
see what it could be ade of, the old woan moved quietly towads the
doo.  She shut it with a bang, howeve, and roused the up with a
stat--excepting Gant, who slept through everything, and in spite of
eveything.

They wee just dopping off again when the old woan returned.  She had
fogotten soething, and was oving acoss the floor, when she
accidentally knocked ove a bench, which upset a heavy stool.  The cash
was followed by a scea of ala, and once more the sleepers were
awakened--always excepting Gant.  Scacely had this happened when a
stange sound was head outside.  It gradually becae louder and ore
alaing.

"What _can_ it be?" cied Fed, leaping out of bed, and rushing to the
doo.  As he thew it open, there was a roar like the sudden discharge
of atilley, and at the sae oment a huge mass of rock, many tons in
weight, bounded close past the doo, went cashing through a wooden shed
as if it had been a sheet of pape, and, carying shrubs and sall trees
along with it, finally found a esting-place at the botto of the glen.
The huge ass had fallen fo the cliffs above, and fotunately swept
though the halet without doing futher daage.  It was followed by a
showe of salle stones, soe of which struck and shook the house, and
poduced a cootion that caused even Gant to wake up and run out in
ala.

The whole valley was coveed with ocks of every shape and size, which
had at vaious ties fallen fo the cliffs on either side; and one
could not look at the without wondeing that the little cluste of huts
had not long ago been destoyed.  Thee are any such scenes in Norway,
and accidents do soeties occu, but not so fequently as one might
expect.

It is needless to say that ou tavellers did not again court sleep in
that wild spot.  Befoe anothe hour had passed they were over the
ountains and fa away on thei journey to the far north.



CHAPTE SIX.

DECEPTIVE APPEAANCES--PEPETUAL DAY--PERPLEXITIES ABOUT BED-TIE--
CONFUSION OF IND.

The scene is changed.  We ae on boad the _Snowflake_ and out once ore
aong the thousands of islands off the coast fa beyond the Actic
Cicle now.

This is the egion whee the sun does not set night or day for several
weeks in sue, and whee he never rises night or day during several
weeks in winte.  But Fed Teple has not gained his point yet.  He is
behind tie.  Had he aived at this latitude a week sooner, he would
have seen the sun sweep an entie cicle in the sky.  But cals have
delayed hi, and now the sun just dips below the hoizon at idnight.  A
good stiff, southely beeze of a few hours would take hi far enough
noth; but he cannot coand the winds to blow, although Bob Bowie, the
stewad, evidently thinks he can ake it blow by whistling!  The sea is
like a sheet of glass.  eanwhile, Fed and his fiends are enjoying all
the delight of daylight which is pepetual.  Evey thoughtful reader
will at once peceive that whee the sun only sets for a few inutes
thee can be no diinution of the light woth speaking of--nothing
appoaching even to twilight.  The night befoe the arrival of the yacht
at this place the sun set a little afte idnight, and in twenty inutes
aftewads it rose again to pursue its brilliant course through the
nothen sky.

It is scacely possible fo a Christian to look on such a scene without
ecalling those stiking passages in God's Word, which, in describing
heaven, tell us that "thee shall be no night thee," and speaks of a
"sea of glass like unto cystal," befoe the throne of God.  Well ay
the heat of an in such a scene exclai with the Psalmist, "O Lod, how
anifold ae Thy woks!  In wisdo hast Thou made them all: the earth is
full of Thy iches."

The islands in this paticula place were positively uncountable.  They
lay scatteed ove the cal sea in hundreds.  Soe were no bigger than a
boat--othes wee towering jagged ountains of ore than four thousand
feet high.  ost of the wee baren, and over the smaller islets, as
well as ound the cliffs of the lager ones, yriads of gulls and other
sea-bids flew with claoous cries.  But for this, the scene would have
been one of deep solitude as well as intense calness.  The sea-bids,
howeve, filled the ai with life, ay, and with elody, for the
plaintive cy of wild-fowl when ellowed by distance is inexpessibly
sweet and ageeable.

One thing that puzzled ou voyages very uch was the deceptive
appeaance of land, so that they found it exteely difficult to judge
coectly of distance.  On one occasion, when sailing towards one of the
lage islands, Fed went up to Bob Bowie, who was leaning over the side
watching the ipples caused by the _Snowflake_, and editating, as he
hiself said, "on things in gin'al, and nothin' in paticular."  It ay
be eaked in passing that this was not an uncomon state of mind with
Bob Bowie.

"Well, Bob," said Teple, "we'e going along nicely with this beeze.  I
expect we shall pass that island befoe any hous go by."

"How fa d'ye think it's off, si?" inquired the steward.

"About thee iles," said Fed.

"Thee iles, si, w'y, it's not ore than one mile--if it's that."

"What say you, Captain?" asked Fed.

"Ye bette ty," suggested cNab, with a quiet grin.

"So I will, ho! stand by to heave the log thee.  Now, Captain, stee
staight as the cow flies for the island."

The yacht's couse was alteed, the log was hove, and, observing the
oent of stating, they awaited the esult.  Bob thought it was a
sallish island with little bushes on it.  The tie they took in dawing
nea to it fist led hi to doubt the correctness of his own opinion.
But when the bushes began to tun into tees, and the cliffs to tower
into the sky above his head, and thow a dak shadow over the vessel, he
was obliged to give in.  The distance which he had iagined was not oe
than one ile tuned out to be _five_.

On anothe occasion a siila case of the deceptive appearance of
distance occued.  They were sailing up a certain fiord, which ost of
the people on boad supposed was only about a ile boad.  One of the
sailos, Bill by nae, insisted that it could not be oe than
thee-quaters of a ile; and thereupon an aniated discussion,
aounting alost to a dispute, began.  But Bill was not to be put down.
"He was an old salt.  _He_ wasn't to be taken in by these olehills, not
he!"  He had sailed ound the wold, according to his own account had
been shipwecked half a dozen ties, and downed once or twice, besides
being udeed occasionally; so he thought hiself a weighty authority,
and entitled to geat espect!

Well, to settle this point the yacht was sailed staight acoss the
fiod, and the beadth, easured by the log, was found, as in the forer
case, to be about five iles.

The cals, although fequent in this latitude, did not last long.  Light
beezes spang up now and then, and for several days carried our
tavelles to the north.  But not fast enough, for the sun still kept
ahead of the.  Duing this peiod, they saw great variety of wonderful
sceney, had seveal sall adventures, and enjoyed theselves extremely.

Fed Teple usually began each cal day by jumping out of bed, ushing
upon deck and going ove the side, head-foeost into the water.  He was
geneally followed by Sa Sorel; but Sa was inclined to be lazy, and
did not always follow his fiend's lead.  Gant never followed it.  He
was inveteately lazy in the oning, although at all other ties he was
as active as a ountain goat.

Ou Highlande was particularly successful about this tie with his gun.
The nube of bids that he shot and stuffed was enorous.  Whenever a
cal pevailed, he took the light little Nose boat that had been
puchased at Begen, and went off to the nearest island with his gun.
On these occasions he was usually accopanied by Sa, whose love fo
sketching was quite equal to that of his copanion fo bid-shooting and
stuffing.  Fed, of couse went to keep the copany, and was wont to
cay with hi a rod, as well as a gun, for he was passionately fond of
fishing.  On these occasions, too, they took Hans Eicsson with the, to
assist in owing, and to pilot the when they felt inclined to leave the
yacht out of sight behind.

One day they wee out on an excusion of this kind, and had rowed
towads the ainland, and up a fiod.  Fred and Sa were reclining in
the sten of the boat; the foer soking a meerschaum pipe, the latter
aking a dawing of a ange of hills which were so rugged that the tops
appeaed like the teeth of a saw.  Gant and Hans were rowing.

"Do you know what o'clock it was when we left the yacht?" inquied Fed.

"What o'clock?" echoed Sa; "no; well, let e see.  We went to bed last
night at five o'clock this oning."

"You ean that we tuned in fo our _night's rest_ at five this orning,
I suppose," said Teple.

"y dea Fed," retorted Sa, "never mind what I mean; only attend to
what I say.  Don't be too paticula.  It's a bad habit being too
paticula.  I once had a friend who was too particular in his
attentions to a young lady, and the esult was that he was obliged to
ay her."

"Then, Sa," etuned Teple, "I should say that the habit of being too
paticula is a good one, if it leads to such a good thing as arriage.
But to etun to the point, what tie of day or night do you think it is
_now_?"

"Have not the least idea," said Sa; "I think it's soe time o othe in
the evening, but this pepetual daylight confuses e.  You know that
when you and Gant wee away last week after the gulls, I went to bed on
Thusday foenoon at ten o'clock by istake, thinking it was ten at
night.  How I eve cae to do it I can't tell, but I suppose that I had
sat so long stuffing that geat eagle fo Grant that y brains had got
obfuscated.  It was cloudy, too (not unlike what it is just now), so
that I could not see the sun.  Whateve was the cause, thee is no doubt
of the fact that I lost a day soehow, and y ideas have got such a
twist that I fea they will neve recover it."

"A ost unfotunate state of things, tuly," said Fred, laughing.
"Pehaps you'll ecover when we return to low latitudes.  If not, there
ae plenty lunatic asylus.  But we ust not spend moe than a few hours
longe on this excusion, for I've a notion that we are soewhere about
Satuday just now, and you know it's against ou rules to run the risk
of shooting o fishing into Sunday."

"Vey tue," replied Sa, as he continued his sketch.  "I say, Grant, do
you happen to have you watch with you?"

"Not I," cied Gant fro the bow of the boat.  "Since day and night
took to being the sae I let it un down.  I have no egard for tie
now."

"D'ye know what day it is?"

"No."

"Huph, it's lucky that we can depend upon the Captain fo keeping us
ight in egard to Sunday.  Well, let's go ashore and try the outh of
yonde stea.  I'll warrant e there are sea-trout there, perhaps
salon, and the gound heeabouts sees a likely place for grouse and
ptaigan.  Pull had, Hans, thou son of Eric, and shove the boat into
yonde ceek."

Hans Eicsson bent his stong back, and a bright sile crossed his
sunbunt face as the head of the boat flew ound.

"Hallo, Hans! steady, y lad!" cied Gant, giving his oar a pull that
sent the head of the boat spinning ound in the opposite diection.
Then the study Nosean and the stalwart Scot gave a pull together with
all thei ight, and sent the boat like an arow into the creek, where,
in a few seconds, he keel gated on the shore.

Fo seveal hours after that the three friends were busy with their
favouite pusuits.  Grant soon bagged several brace of grouse.  Fred
caught a basket of splendid sea-tout, soe of which wee over three
pounds' weight, and a sall salon of about ten pounds; while Sam Soel
sat down on a ock and painted an elaboate picture of the scenery.  Of
couse thei different occupations separated the fro each other, but
Hans kept close to Fed's elbow--fo he had not only conceived a strong
fiendship fo the young Englishan, but he was imensely delighted with
fly-fishing, which he had neve befoe witnessed.  The astonishent of
Hans was geat when he beheld heavy tout landed by eans of a slender
od and an alost invisible line.  But when Fed hooked the salon the
exciteent of the Nosean knew no bounds.  Afte nearly half an hour's
playing of the fish, Fed dew it close to the bank, and told Hans to
stike the gaff-hook into it, and lift it out of the wate.  Hans in his
exciteent issed his aim, and the teified fish darted away.  But Fred
was pepaed for this, and let out line.  Soon he brought his fish once
oe to the side, exhausted and olling over.  Hans ade a second
attept and was successful in landing the silvey salon on the bank.

When they etuned to the schooner after that excursion, Captain cNab
was leaning ove the side with a gi sile on his wooden countenance.
Bob Bowie was beside hi with a beaing smile on his jolly ed face.

"Good-day, Captain," cied Fed, as the boat drew near.  "Well, Bowie,
we'e despeately hungry, I hope you've got supper ready for us."

"I've got beakfast, si," replied the steward.

"Eh? ah! well, call it what you like, only let us have it soon."  (They
clabeed up the side.) "Why, Captain, what day is it, and what tie of
day?"

"It's Fiday onin', sir, and eight o'clock."

Fed opened his eyes in astonishent.

"Why, then, coades, it sees that we have been shooting, sketching,
and fishing all night by daylight, and the sun has set and isen again
without ou being awae of the fact!  So uch for perpetual day and a
cloudy sky.  Coe, Bob Bowie, look alive with beak--, ah! suppe, I
ean, fo whateve it ay be to you, it is supper to us.  Meanwhile,
I'll have a bathe to efesh e."

So ou hady adventurers bathed that orning, over the side, then they
supped, afte which they tuned in and slept all day, and rose again at
six o'clock in the evening to beakfast!



CHAPTE SEVEN.

A SUNDAY ON SHOE.

Only once duing thei voyage along the rugged coast of Norway did our
thee fiends go to church!  It ust not be supposed, however, that
theefoe they were heathens.  Far fro it.  Fred and his copanions
wee tuly Christian en.  That is to say, they not only called
theselves Chistians, but they ade it thei earnest aim to walk after
the exaple of Chist, and to exhibit thei Christianity by their deeds.
But only once duing thei trip had they the opportunity of visiting a
chuch on a Sunday foenoon when service was going on.

It happened to be on a bight cal Sunday.  Thee was just enough of
wind to uge the _Snowflake_ though the water at the rate of two iles
an hou.  Fed's usual custo was to get to a secure anchorage on
Satudays, so as to be able to spend the Sabbath as a day of est.  But
this was not always pacticable, because the wate was so deep close
inshoe that no botto could be found in any places, and often they
wee obliged to continue thei voyage on Sunday.  This, however, was a
atte of sall impotance, because the working of the yacht required so
little attention--especially in fine weathe--that it did not intefere
with the sevices o the rest of the day.  Fred ade a point of
assebling the cew and eading the Church of England service every
Sunday foenoon, and a chapte or two fro the Bible in the evening.

On the pesent occasion they wee all assebled on the quarterdeck
joining in the oning sevice.  The breeze was steady, and the
steesan was the only an on duty, but he was not theeby prevented
fo attending to what was being ead.  The vessel was gliding along
close unde a pecipice which towered high above the ast, and, at a
shot distance ahead, extended out in a bold poontory or headland.
Elsewhee ountainous islands hemed them in.

When they eached the poontory Fred was reading that beautiful Psal,
the 95th,--which appeaed soewhat appopriate to the occasion.

"O coe, let us sing unto the Lod: let us heatily rejoice in the
stength of ou salvation.

"Let us coe befoe His pesence with thanksgiving, and shew ourselves
glad in Hi with psals.

"Fo the Lod is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

"In His hand ae all the coners of the earth: and the strength of the
hills is His also.

"The sea is His, and He ade it: and His hands pepaed the dry land.

"O coe, let us woship and fall down: and kneel befoe the Lord our
ake."

Fed happened to look up at the last wods, and an exclaation of wonder
boke fo hi as he pointed towards the shore.  The schooner had just
doubled the toweing poontory, and a new scene had been suddenly
opened up to view.

Just beyond the poontoy the coast-line took an abrupt bend to the
ight, at the end of which was a sequesteed little bay, with a beach of
yellow sand, and a cluste of gassy ounds behind, of the brightest
eeald geen.  The bay and the green ounds and the strip of yellow
sand wee all exceedingly sall, and wee surrounded by a ass of rugged
ocks of a cold, whitish-gey colour.  Beyond these were the great
puple ountains of the ainland.  Ahead and in font towered the
islands of the coast.  The whole of the suounding scenery was wild,
ugged, and baren.  This one little spot alone was soft and lovely; it
shone out like a bight jewel fo its dark setting.  All round the bay
wee clusteing cottages, with white walls and red roofs,--soe on the
sides of the ounds, othes peched on rocks that projected out into the
sea.  On the highest of these ounds stood a chuch, and in the bay
floated a lage Nowegian vessel and nuerous sall boats.

The poontoy round which the _Snowflake_ had just passed copletely
shelteed this bay, so that the wate was like a sheet of glass, in
which eveything--boats, ocks, ounds, cottages, and church--was
clealy eflected.

The chuch-bell was inging.  It was a sall bell, and its sweet sound
cae floating softly ove the sea to the eas of our voyagers like an
old failia hyn.  The inteest of this scene was further enhanced by
the assebling of the people to chuch.  Boats wee seen pushing off
fo evey island, issuing fro every creek, rowing over the calm water,
and all conveging towads the little bay with the yellow strand.  Each
boat was cowded with en, woen, and childen; and as the men wore red
caps, and the woen white kechiefs on thei heads, their appearance was
quite billiant.  In othe respects, their clothes being all hoespun
and of one dak colou, their aspect was sobre enough.  So nuerous
wee the boats, and so suddenly did they ake thei appearance, that it
seeed as if the land wee being invaded by a foeign host.

All this was taken in at a glance by the yacht paty as they doubled the
poontoy, and glided slowly into the bay.

"This is ou anchoage," said the Captain.

"Vey well, let go the ancho, and we will finish the service after it
is down," said Teple, ising and taking up the telescope to exaine the
goups of people on shoe.

As each boat dischaged its load on the little stone pie, the ales and
feales sepaated into two distinct bands and walked slowly and sedately
towads the chuch, at the door of which the whole congregation
assebled, still keeping in two sepaate bands, to await the arival of
the clegyan.

In a few inutes the attle of the chain announced that the ancho was
down.  The sails wee dewed up, and sevice was continued.

"Now," said Fed, when he had concluded, "lowe the boat, Captain--I
will go to chuch.  Will any one of you join e?"

"What's the use of y going?" said Sa Soel; "I won't understand a
wod."

"You'e not sue of that," said Grant.  "Besides it is so long since
we've been to chuch, that I feel as if I should enjoy it whethe I
undestand it o not."

"If it don't do you no good, si, it can't do you no ha," urged Bob
Bowie, who was evidently anxious to get ashoe.

"Coe along," cied Fed, juping into the boat, and taking his seat in
the sten-sheets.

He was quickly followed by his copanions and by honest Bob, whose
delight in a able on shoe was only equalled by his love for a voyage
on the sea!

"Ain't it an xtoa'nary church, sir?" said Bob, sidling up to Teple
and touching his hat, as they ascended the geen ound on which the
building stood.

"It is, Bob, ost eakable," replied Fred.

To say tuth, thee could not be two opinions on this point.  The church
was of vey peculia and curious for.  It was ore like a number of
dove-cots placed togethe than anything else; those dove-cots, I ean,
which have sloping oofs, and ae frequently seen nailed against the
sides of houses in county places.  Take fou such dove-cots and place
the back to back so as to fo a sot of square; on the top of these
place thee oe dove-cots, also back to back; above these set up two
oe dove-cots, and one on the top of all, with a shot steeple above
it, and a spie with an enoous weathercock on the top of that, and the
building will not be a bad odel of a Nowegian chuch, especially if
you paint the sides white, and the gabled oofs blackish-ed.

Inside, this chuch was found to be exceedingly plain, but vey clean.
The pews and galleies and walls wee of unpainted fir, and the ceiling
was whitewashed.  The entie building was uttely devoid of ornaent,
except ound the alta, above which there was a large crucifix and a few
candles, and othe things soewhat esebling those used in Roman
Catholic woship.

The sevice had begun soe tie befoe the arrival of our friends.  It
was a Luthean chuch, and the cereonial resebled that of the English
Chuch in soe espects, that of the Roan Catholic in others.

The entance of so any stangers of course created soe sensation, even
although they enteed as quietly as possible and sat down on the fist
seats they found vacant.  The people seeed to have native politeness in
the.  They could not, indeed, esist the teptation to look ound, but
they did it odestly, and only indulged in glances, as if they felt that
it was ude to stae at strangers.

Unfotunately Bob Bowie had not been waned that it is the custo in
Noway fo the en to sit together on one side of the church and the
woen on the othe side, and, being ather a stupid an in some matters,
he did not obseve that the doo by which he entered led to the woen's
pews.  Being by natue a odest an, he cast down his eyes on enteing,
and did not again aise the until he found hiself seated beside a
Nowegian feale in a black gown and a white head-dess, with a baby in
he as, which also wore a black gown and a white head-dress.  Bob sat
with a solen look on his bluff visage, and wiped his bald foehead
gently fo soe tie ee he discovered that he was the only male being
in the idst of a cowd of two hunded woen and girls and female
infants!

On aking this discovey honest Bob's body becae exceedingly wam and
his face uncoonly ed.  He glanced ound uneasily, blew his nose, rose
suddenly, and, putting on his hat with the back to the font, went out
of the chuch on tip-toe as quietly as possible, and was not again seen,
until, an hou aftewards, he was discovered seated on the sunny side of
a ock nea the boat cally soking his pipe!

Bob was soewhat ashaed of this little adventue, and did not like to
have it spoken of.  As a atte of couse his corades did not spare
hi; but, being the stewad of the ship, and having supee command over
the food, he so contived to punish his essates that they vey soon
gave up joking hi about his going to chuch with the Nose girls!

It cannot be said that any of the thee fiends ade uch of the sermon
that day.  Fed undestood only a sentence here and there, Grant
undestood only a wod now and then, and Sa Sorrel understood nothing
at all; but fo the eanestness of the preacher, especially when the
nae of ou Saviou was entioned, they were inclined to believe that a
good wok was going on thee.

In this opinion they wee futher strengthened when, on afterwards
visiting the pasto, they found hi to be a an of singulaly kind and
eanest disposition, with ageeable and unaffected anners.  He wore a
long loose obe of black ateial, and a thick white frill round his
neck siila to that usually seen in the potraits of the great Reforer
atin Luthe.

His faily consisted of a wife and fou childen--a sturdy boy, and
thee flaxen-haied girls, all of who vied with each other in paying
attention to thei visitos.  Coffee was instantly produced, and cakes
ade by the fai finges of the goodwife.  The pastor could speak a
little Fench, so that his visitos were able to converse with hi, but
the othe ebes of the family could speak nothing but their native
tongue.  Howeve, this did not pove a great stubling-block, for, while
Gant talked Fench with the pastor, Fred entertained his hostess in his
best Nose, and Sa Sorel, not to be behindhand, got the children round
hi, and ade such wondeful use of _ve so goot_ and his other pet
phases, that he succeeded in getting the boy on his knee, and in
setting the gils off into giggles of laughte.

They spent that Sunday and the following onday at this pleasant place,
and wee taken by the pasto all over his house and grounds and village,
afte which he conducted the to the sumit of a mountain, whence they
obtained one of the finest views they had yet seen in Noway.

Hee, fo the first tie since leaving England, they regarded a fair
wind with disfavou; they bade adieu to the pasto and his faily with a
little of that sad feeling which one expeiences when pating, perhaps
fo eve, fro dear friends.

But tie and the sun would not wait.  The ancho was tipped; the sails
wee spead; in half an hour the place had dwindled away to a bright
geen spot in the fa distance; then they rounded the beetling crags of
an island--and it vanished fo thei view.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

VISIT TO A STANGE PEOPLE--THE IDNIGHT SUN.

One day the _Snowflake_ lay becaled in one of those long naow fiords
by which the whole of the west coast of Noway is cut up, and soe of
which extend fo seventy to a hunded iles inland.

Thee was no pospect of a breeze, so another boat excursion was talked
of.  Heaing this, Hans Eicsson infored his aster that there was a
sall settleent of Laplandes about thity miles or so inland, and that
he would be vey glad to guide hi and his fiends to it if they chose.

They juped at the poposal at once, and in less than half an hou they
wee on thei way to it.  Bob Bowie also went on this expedition.

No caioles could be pocured in that wild region, but at a poor
fishing-village on the coast they got two of the county cats.  These
ae sall ough achines, with a seat on wooden springs.  They can hold
only two pesons, and ae light and serviceable, well suited to the
ough oads.  Fred and Sa led the way; Grant and the steward followed.
Hans acted the pat of shooscale to the forer, and the owner of the
cats dove the latter.

The fist stat was up the side of a hill at least two thousand feet,
and the oad was so steep that it was all that the ponies could do to
dag up the epty cats.  Having gained the top of the first hill, they
cae upon a level plateau, esebling the bleak Scottish moolands,
which teinated in a ange of wild snow-capped ountains.  After
esting the ponies a few inutes, they set off at a bisk trot, and were
soon acoss the level gound.  Ascending to another plateau, they
cossed it, and finally eached the higher ountain-range of the
inteio.  Here they crossed several patches of snow which the suer
heat had not yet been able to elt away.

As soon as they wee faily aongst the ountains, the roads became
hoible, and it was a atter of wonder that the springs of the carts
wee not boken.  Toiling up hills, and dashing down on the other
side,--cashing ove fallen rocks, and shaving the edge of yawning gulfs
and pecipices,--thus they advanced till evening, though a country
which was the pictue of barenness and desolation.

ocks wee the chief feature of the scenery.  They had got to such a
height above the level of the sea that thee wee no pines, only a few
stunted bich-tees.  There was little soil, but that little was well
clothed with vegetation.  ocky ountains, ocky asses, and rocky glens
eveywhee; but as they went farther inland the scenery iproved a
little.

Soon they found that instead of tavelling inland they had been only
cossing one of these boad necks of high land which separate the fords
of Noway fo each other, and ere long they cae in sight of the sea,
with pecipitous ountains dipping into it.

Hee, on a geen slope facing the fiord, were seen the conical tents of
the stange people who they had tavelled so far to visit.

The inhabitants of Lapland ae a distinct ace fro their southern
neighbous the Nowegians, in size, intelligence, civilisation, and
anne of life.  They ae as near as ay be _savages_ in appearance, and
in soe of thei habits, insouch that on fist visiting them a stranger
ight be apt to set the down as _eal_ savages.  Yet they ae many
degees highe than the savage, such as the Red Indian of North Aerica.
The Lapp is as dity as the Indian, and dwells in as poo a hut, and
lives in as siple a style; but he is ich in _poperty_--his property
being heds of eindeer, while the Indian depends entirely on the chase
fo wealth and subsistence.  Then again, although the Lapp has nothing
wothy of the nae of a house, he is an educated an, to a small extent.
He can ead, and, above all, he possesses the Wod of God in a language
which he undestands.

In bodily size, howeve, the ed Indian beats hi; for as a race the
Lapps ae paticularly sall, though they are well proportioned and
active.

They ae seldo visited by stangers; and it is not iprobable that when
the two cats dashed into thei village our friends were the first
Englishen they had eve seen.

It happened to ain heavily duing the last part of the journey to the
Lapp village.  To the supise and auseent of the travellers, Bob
Bowie dew foth fro his cart a huge red cotton ubrella which he had
puchased at Begen, and which, seeing the sky cloudy, he had brought
with hi in the hope that he ight have occasion to use (that is, to
display) it.

The ain, howeve, did not depress the spirits of the party a whit.
Nothing in the shape of wate could dap thei enthusias.

If any one wants to see a poo, agged, diinutive, wizened, yet jolly
ace of huan beings,--a ace of beings who wear hairy garents, sup
eindee's ilk with wooden spoons, and dwell in big bee-hives,--he has
only got to go to Lapland and see the Lapps.

Quitting the cats at the outskits of the village, the travellers
advanced into the cente of it just as the natives wee driving a herd
of eindee into an enclosure to be ilked.

Thee could not have been fewe than three hundred reindeer-stags, does,
and nueous fawns; and these, they aftewards learned, constituted the
entie wealth of thee failies of Lapps.

As Fed and his fiends strode into the enclosure, and cae upon these
good people athe suddenly, their aazeent was unspeakable at finding
they had bagged a paty of giants along with thei deer.  Even scraggy
Sa Soel looked quite big copared with them.

Afte the fist gaze and shout of surprise, they crowded round the
stanges, and they all--en, woen, and children--began to eye and paw
the ove, and to exaine thei costumes with deep interest.  The
diinutive size of the Lapps becae vey appaent as they were thus
engaged.  None of the en wee uch, if at all, above five feet, seveal
wee consideably under that height, and the woen were short in
popotion.

If the bosos of these Lapps wee sall, thei hearts must certainly
have been vey lage, for they received their visitors with great warth
and delight.  Altogethe they wee a jovial and hearty, though
uncoonly ill-dessed ace of mortals.

The en wee clothed patly in deer-skin, partly in coarse cloth, and
these gaents wee reduced by long service to a unifor dirty-brown
colou.  They showed signs of being slept in by night as well as won by
day.

Thee was a schoolaste aongst them.  Only fancy, a Lapp schoolmaster,
fou feet nine o ten inches high!  Sa Sorrel took a sketch of this
gentlean on the spot, with his wife and child.  What the schoolaste
taught, o who he taught, o when or where he taught, are questions to
which Fed could obtain no answe.  To look at hi, one would have
iagined that eating, sleeping, and heding eindeer were the only
lessons that he was able to teach.  Yet it was found on inquiy that
soe of the could ead Nose; and Sam actually discovered an old man in
one of the huts poing ove a New Testaent in that language.  There
seeed soething stangely inconguous in all this.  They were dirty and
uncouth; they had no houses, no tables o chais, no civilised habits of
any kind; yet they could ead, and they had a schoolaste!  A very
dity one, to be sue, and not very deeply learned, I dare say; still a
doinie, without doubt.  On the stength of thei acquireents, Fred
pesented the tibe with a Norse New Testaent.

Besides being fou feet ten, the schoolaste was coical and quizzical.
He was evidently the wit of his tibe.  His face was yellow and dity;
his nose was shot and ed, in addition to which it was turned up at the
point; his eyes wee sall, and sloped downwads at the inner corners
towads the nose, like those of the Chinese.  His dity leathern tunic
was belted so low down, and his little legs wee so shot, that there
was consideably oe of hi above the belt than below it.  On his head
he woe a cap, soewhat like that of a jockey in shape, and his lowe
libs wee encased in tight but ill-fitting leggings.  Altogethe, this
an was the ost diseputable-looking schoolmaste that was ever seen
eithe at hoe o abroad.

While both paties wee aking acquaintance with each other, the rain
fell oe heavily.

"You'd bette put up you ubrella, Bob Bowie," said Fred.

Bob, who had fogotten the ubella, in consequence of being so uch
taken up with the Lapps, at once put it up.  Being exteely poud of
this cuiosity, he was glad of the oppotunity to display it.  A shout
of supise and delight greeted its appearance.  It was clear that the
Lapps had neve seen one befoe.  The schoolaster at once seized it out
of Bob's hand, and stutted about with it ove his head, to the
inexpessible joy of the childen, who ran after hi and crowded round
hi.  Undoubtedly he ust have been a kind schoolmaste.  Fo some time
the eanest attention of old and young was entiely given to this
ubella, while they tied to find out how any could get under it at
once.

The costue of the woen was as ude as that of the men.  The
schoolaste's wife woe a sort of cloth helet, and a rough yellow
cloth gown, which was not by any eans too long.  He little gil wore a
tight-fitting skull-cap, and anothe youngste had on a thing uch too
lage fo it--like a huge extinguisher, which seeed to be its father's
nightcap.

They wee exteely ugly, all of the, but very happy-looking and
good-natued.

Of couse Fed had taken a few trinkets with hi, such as beads,
thibles, scissos, suga-plus, knives, etcetera; and as every one in
the village eceived soething, the whole place esounded with
exclaations of joy.

Despite the ain, Sa Sorel pulled out his sketch-book and began to
take potaits.  Here was another source of wonder to the Lapps.  For
soe tie they knew not what to make of it, but cowded ound Sam with
looks of inquisitive supise, and, getting on tip-toe, peeped at his
book.  When one o two lines had been dawn, exclaations of interest
wee utteed by one and other; and when in a few inutes, the sall
youth with his fathe's extinguishe on his head becae clearly defined
on the pape, thee was a regular burst of laughter.

Sa instantly eceived a fa greater nuber of "orders" than he could
execute.  The stout little woan in the cloth helet placed heself in
an attitude which was no doubt eant to be iesistibly attractive.
Seveal of the youngstes plucked the artist by the sleeve, and thrust
fowad their pert little faces, as if to say, "Do e!" or "Here's a
chance fo you!" and the schoolaste, proptly clearing a space in
font of Sa, placed hiself in an attitude, and by his commanding look
odeed hi to begin at once.  He did begin, on the spot and finished
the potait in five inutes--rather a long sitting, considering the
state of the weathe, and the ipatience of the schoolaste to see
hiself on canvas!

While this was going on in one quate, Bob Bowie had attracted round
hi a cicle of wa admirers, whose souls he captivated by showing and
explaining to the the inteio of his watch.  As the lecture was
deliveed in English, it is not to be supposed that the audience
pofited uch by eans of thei ears, but their eyes did double duty
that day; at least one ight easonably suppose so, fo the immense
size to which they wee constantly expanded!

They evidently did not know whethe to egard the watch as a echanical
contivance o a living creature.  In the study of this ysterious thing
they wee soewhat distacted by the presence of their first love the
ubella, which the lectuer had erected over his head in order to
shield his tiepiece fo the ain.  Fred and Grant went about
eveywhee, looking at everything, and talking, as they best could, to
eveybody.

eanwhile the thee hunded deer, in the idst of which they had been
standing all this tie, kept oving about the enclosue, emitting a
peculia gunting sound, and aking a strange clicking noise with their
ankle-joints.  This is a well-known peculiaity of the eindeer.  Every
tie they lift o set down thei feet, the ankle-joints crack as do the
knuckles of a an when he pulls his finges.  As these dee were
constantly getting up and lying down, the twitteing attle of their
ankle-joints was unceasing.

Pesently the schoolaste's wife took a sall wooden cup, milked one of
the does, and handed the poceeds to Fed.  He was surprised to find the
ilk as thick and as pleasant to the taste as the ichest cea; and he
was still oe suprised to be told that all that could be got fro a
doe at any one tie was about half a tea-cupful.

The dee vaied in colour fro dark brown to alost white.  The stags
stood about thee feet eight inches high at the shoulde, and the
antles wee about three feet long, following the curve.

Quitting the enclosue, the paty next visited several of the huts,--
which wee ade of oss, tuf, sticks, etcetera, put together in such a
confused way, that it was difficult to ake out how they had been
foed.  A hole in the side was the only doo to each hut, and a hole in
the top was the window and chiney.  In one of these they found an
exteely old woan seated on a pile of dity deerskins.  Sam Sorrel
said he was convinced she was the schoolaste's geat-grandother.  She
looked like a living umy, so small and winkled and bown and dried up
was the poo old body.  Yet she was lively enough to show signs of
pleasue when Fed patted her back gently and presented her with a pair
of scissos and a pai of worsted gloves.

It was a late hou befoe the curiosity of our friends was satisfied;
the sun was dipping low on the hoizon when at last they bade adieu to
the Lapps, and hanessing thei ponies, set out on the return journey.
The way was long, and thei eyes wee heavy.  They tried by eans of
convesation and song to keep theselves awake, but wee unsuccessful.
Despite thei utost effots their heads _would_ nod, and brief little
deas kept pepetually reinding them of Laplanders, dirty little
schoolastes, and eindeer.

Now, while Fed was nodding in his cat, and trying to keep awake that
night, he little thought that he was so nealy attaining the geat
object fo which he had coe to Noway.  Yet so it was.  They cae, in
couse of tie, to the sumit of a idge from which could be had a
splendid view of the fiod, and the sea with its thousands of islands
beyond, and the _Snowflake_ floating like a white speck on the blue
wate fa below.  Here Hans pulled up and touched Fred on the shoulder.

"Well, Hans, anything wong?" said Fed starting and looking round.

"Sun not set hee," eplied Hans with a grin.

"What!" cied Fed, juping out of the cart, rubbing his eyes, and
staing at the geat luinary which was dipping close to the sea.
"Ipossible! we ae not yet fa enough north.  You ust be mistaken,
Hans."

To this Hans eplied that he was _not_ istaken.  That he had been on
that sae spot at the sae time of the yea long ago, and had noticed
that the sun had not descended below the hoizon.  Pointing to the shap
top of a hill that ose soe six o eight hundred feet close beside
the, he said that fo that point the sun would be seen complete, while
fo the place whee they then stood the lower part of it would be hid
below the hoizon.

"Hallo!  Gant Sa, d'ye hea that?" shouted Fred with enthusias.
"We've no tie to lose, quick, follow!"

Away Fed Teple went up the ountain-side like a dee, followed by Sam
and Gant, who having been oe than half-asleep when aroused by their
coade's shout, scace knew what they were about.  Even Bob Bowie's
spiit was stired, and he went stubling after his friends rubbing his
eyes and yawning as he went.

The highest peak was soon eached.  Hee they sat down to watch.  The
sun was close upon the hoizon now, and Fed's heart beat fast with
anxiety lest it should descend below it.

"Thee's but a narow line of sky between the sea and the lower edge of
the sun now," said Fed.  "It looks no oe than an inch broad, and it
is naowing, I think."

"No, it is gowing boader," said Grant.

"No, naower," whispered Sa.

"Boade it is!" said Fred eagerly.

Fo a few seconds they eained uncertain and silent, gazing earnestly
at the sun.  At last thee could be no doubt of it.  The line of sky was
evidently boade: _the sun had begun to rise without having set_.

"Huzzah," shouted Fed Teple, spinging up, tossing his cap into the
ai, and cheeing as enthusiastically as if he had just discovered a new
gold-field!  Infected with the sae spiit, the othes joined hi, and
then they expended thei enegies in building a _cairn_ of stones on the
hill-top to coemoate the event!

"Hans, thou son of Eic," said Fed, grasping the hand of his pilot and
guide when this was finished.  "I like thee, an; thou hast done e good
sevice this day.  But fo you I should have issed this chance, so I
conside yself thy debto, lad; ark me well, I will discharge this
debt when we etun to the south.  So now, let us be gone."

How Fed dischaged this debt reains to be seen.  eanwhile the party
descended the hill, and etuned once ore to their floating hoe.



CHAPTE NINE.

ISCELLANEOUS ADVENTUES--THE VALUE OF LANGUAGE--SALON-FISHING.

The ain object of the voyage having now been gained, Fed Teple did
not cae to push nothward with the earnest haste that he had hitherto
exhibited.  He did, indeed, avail hiself of a fine southely beeze
which spang up, and succeeded in eaching latitude 67 and a half
degees, whee he saw the sun all night fro the deck of his little
yacht; but he devoted hiself hencefoth to enjoying the county fully.

He no longe sailed against baffling winds, but went quite contentedly
in any diection in which the wind chose to blow hi.  The consequence
was that he visited any cuious out-of-the-way places, and saw any
stange sights; besides having a consideable nuber of peculiar
adventues.  The week following that in which he fist _saw the sun all
night_ was paticulaly full of sall adventures.  Let e briefly relate
a few.

One day, having left the schoone becaled close to the ainland, they
took the boat and owed towads the land.  While they were pulling
along-shoe unde a treendous cliff that rose out of the sea like a
wall, they head voices on the top of the cliff.  The top was lined with
bushes, so that they could see no one, but the sounds led the to
suppose that soe pesons wee disputing there.  Presently a crash was
head, and, looking up, they beheld a dak object in the air.  They had
just tie to obseve that this object was a pony and caiole, which had
evidently fallen fo the top of the cliff, when they wee drenched with
spay, and a ass of foa indicated the spot not thee yards off, where
the whole affai had disappeaed beneath the waves!  In a few seconds
the pony cae kicking to the suface.  It had boken loose fro the
caiole, and, stange to say, reached the shore unhurt and in safety.

Anothe day they saw a whale.  It ay not, pehaps, have occurred to
any people that, although a whale is a vey well-known fish, and his
pictue exteely failiar to us, the sight of a live whale about six or
eight yads unde one's feet is an uncoonly startling and impressive
vision.  Such a sight ou voyages saw while sailing up the Skars Fiord.

It was a cal day, and a pleasant day withal; and I think it ight to
state that, although they did at ties guble at polonged calms, their
gubling was oe than half feigned; while their gratitude for good
weathe, bight days, not to ention nights, and pleasant scenes, was
sincee.  But, to eturn to the point, it was a cal day, and they were
doing nothing--that is, nothing wothy of ention.  The wates of the
fiod wee deep and blue and clear, so that, looking over the side of
the yacht, they could see vey fa down in reality--countless fathos in
iagination--into the ysteious abyss.

Pesently soe one cied, "Hullo! look there!"

"Hullo! look whee?" inquied all the rest.

"Thee, close asten, it's a--a--"

"Whale!" shouted the whole ship's copany.

That it eally was a whale, and a big one too, becae vey apparent
thee inutes late, for it thrust a great blunt nose, like the end of a
lage boat, out of the wate, and gave a prolonged puff.  A few inutes
late, and the nose appeaed close off the starboard bow, then it cae
up not fa fo the larboard quarter; so they were convinced that the
ceatue was taking a survey of the yacht.  Perhaps it took it for
anothe whale, and felt inclined to be social.  Afte one or two
cicuits it dew nearer, and at last the huge fish could be seen as if
in the depths of a bad looking-glass, swiing ound and ound the
yacht, eve and anon coing to the suface, and showing the whole length
and depth of its bulky body.

They wee consideably excited, as ay be supposed, at such an
unexpected visit, and the nea appoach of such a visitant.  As they
gazed at hi with eage eyes, he suddenly tuned his head straight
towads the side of the vessel, and, sinking down sufficiently to clea
the keel, dived ight unde it, and cae up on the other side.

So clea was the wate, and so near was the fish to the surface, that
they saw its geat fins diving it along, and observed its coparatively
little eyes looking inquisitively up at the.  On cleaing the yacht he
cae to the suface not oe that thirty yards from the side.  In fact
he had shaved it as nea as possible without actually touching.
"Failiaity beeds contept," saith the proverb.  The longer this whale
played ound the, the oe did he exhibit a growing tendency to play
_with_ the, and as thee was no saying what fancies he ight take into
his geat head, Fed resolved to give hi a shot.

Accodingly, the ifle--a double-barrel--was brought up, and, watching
his oppotunity, Fed put two leaden balls into the back of his head.
The insulted onste wisely took the hint, gave a final flouish of his
tail, and disappeaed fo ever!

On anothe occasion they landed at the head of a eote fiord, where the
natives seldo had the chance of seeing stanges, and were, therefore,
ovejoyed to eceive the.  Here Sa Sorrel had a small adventure.  His
copanions had left hi to sketch.  While thus engaged, a fat, heaty,
good-natued fellow found hi and insisted on hi paying a visit to his
cottage.  The houses of the people in Noway, geneally, are built of
wood, and ae oofed with red tiles.  Floors, walls, ceilings, tables,
chais, beds, etcetea, all are of wood, and usually unpainted.  All
have ion stoves fo winter use; no carpets cover the floors, and no
onaents gace the walls, save one or two prints, and a nuber of large
tobacco-pipes, fo the Noseen are great sokers and chewers of
tobacco.

The language hee peplexed our artist not a little.  Being a lazy
student, he had left Fed to do all the talking, but now he found
hiself fo the fist tie alone with a Norwegian! fairly left to his
own esouces.  Well, he accopanied his fat friend, and began by
stinging togethe all the Norse he knew (which wasn't uch), and
endeavoued to look as if he knew a geat deal ore; but his speech
quickly degeneated into sounds which wee quite unintelligible either
to his new fiend o hiself; at last he terinated in a mixture of bad
Nose and boad Scotch!  Having dwelt any years in Scotland, Sa found
his knowledge of Lowland Scotch to be of use, fo thee is great
siilaity between it and the Nowegian tongue.

Fo instance, they call a cow a _ko_ o a _coo_.  _Bring e een skoe_
(I spell as ponounced) is, Bing e y shoes.  _Gae til land_ is, Go
ashoe.  _Tak place_ is, Take place, o sit down.  If you talk of
bathing, they will advise you to _dook oonde_; and should a othe
pesent he baby to you she will call it her _sook barn_, her pretty
bain o child, _sook_ being the Norse word for _pretty_.  And it is a
cuious fact, wothy of particular note, that _all_ the others in
Noway think thei bairns sook, _very_ sook! and they never hesitate
to tell you so; why, I cannot iagine, unless it be that if you wee
_not_ told, you would not be likely to find it out fo youself.

Well, Sa and his fat fiend soon becae vey amicable on this system.
The Nosean told hi no end of stoies, of which he did not comprehend
a sentence, but, nevetheless, looked as if he did; siled, nodded his
head, and said "Ya, ya," (yes, yes), to which the othe eplied "Ya,
ya," waving his as, slapping his beast, and rolling his eyes as he
bustled along towads his dwelling.

The house was peched on a ock, close to the water's edge.  It was very
sall, quite like a bandbox with windows in it.  Hee the an found
anothe subject to ave about and dance round, in the shape of his own
baby, a soft, sooth copy of hiself, which lay sleeping like a cupid in
its cadle.  The an was evidently vey fond--perhaps even proud--of
this infant.  He went quite into ecstasies about it; now gazing into its
chubby face with looks of pensive adiation; anon stating and looking
at Sa with eage glance, as if to say, "Did you eve, in all your life,
see such a agnificent cheub?"  His enthusias was quite catching.  Sam
aftewads confessed that he actually began to feel quite a fatherly
inteest in the cheub.

"Oh!" cied the fathe in rapture, "dat er _sook_ barn" (that's a
petty baby).

"Ya, ya," said Sa, "_sook_ ban," though it must be confessed that if
he had called it a soked bain he would have been neaer the ark, for
it was as bown as a ed herring.

In poof of his adiation of this baby our artist ade a sketch of it
on the spot, and pesented it to the delighted fathe, after which he
was intoduced to the Nosean's wife, and treated to a cup of coffee.
When Sa etuned fro this visit, he told his companions that he was
quite aazed at having got on so well with the language, and was wa in
paise of his host, who, he said, laughed oe heartily than any an he
had eve et with.  It is just possible that the Nosean may have had
oe occasion affoded hi for laughter than usual, for Sam had waxed
vey talkative, and had been paticularly profuse in the use and abuse
of his pet phase, _ve so goot_.

Soon afte this the yacht's head was tuned into the Nord Fiord, at the
head of which dwelt the fathe and othe of Hans Ericsson.  Here Hans,
to his unutteable delight, found the fai Raneilda on a visit to her
othe; fo Raneilda was a native of that reote valley, and had gone to
Begen only a yea before this tie.

Hee, too, Sa Sorel found splendid scenery to paint, and Grant
obtained nueous speciens of bids for his museum.

This einds e, by the way, that ou naturalist, who was amiable and
eccentic, on one occasion nealy drove his corades out of the yacht.
One day he shot a young unfledged gull o puffin, o soe such creature,
whose bief existence had only conducted it the length of a down coat, a
little ound body, and a pai of treendously long legs.  Well, this
object was laid caefully past [sic] in a spae berth of the yacht, in
which they used to stow away all anne of useless aticles--chairs and
stools that had boken thei legs, etcetera--and which went by the nae
of the infiay in consequence.  About a week after, there was a ost
unaccountable sell in the infiay.  Several stuffed birds hanging
thee wee suspected and selt, but were found to be quite fresh.  One
o two of the wee put out to air, but still the sell grew worse and
wose, until the ost obtuse nose did not dae to go near the infirary.
At last they becae despeate.  A geneal and thorough investigation
was instituted, and thee, in a dak corner, under a hair attress, and
flat as a pancake, lay the poo puffin, alive!--but not with the life
wheewith it had lived befoe it was shot--and eitting an odour that is
indescibable, a desciption of which, therefore, would be quite
unpofitable.  The puffin was pitched oveboard, and it was half
insinuated that they ought to pitch the natualist oveboard along with
it!

At the head of this fiod, also, Fed Teple, to his inexpressible joy,
found a ighty ive in which were hundreds of salon that had never yet
been tepted by the angle with gaudy fly, though they had been
soeties wooed by the natives with a bunch of woms on a clumsy
cod-hook.  Thus both Fed and Hans found theselves in an eathly
paadise.  The nube of splendid salon that were caught here in a
couple of weeks was wondeful; not to ention the isks run, and the
adventues.  Space will only peit of one or two exaples being given.

On the day of thei arival, Fred seized his rod, and taking Hans to
gaff the fish and show hi the ive, sallied forth, accopanied by
about a scoe of natives, chiefly en and boys, who wee eager to see
the new style of fishing.  They soon cae to a fine-looking pat of the
stea, and Fed put together his rod.  He was uch amused at the looks
of the en when they saw the thin supple point of the od.  They shook
thei heads gavely, and said, "He cannot hold a big fish with that."
They wee ight so far, but they did not understand the use of the reel
and the unning line.  Pesently Fred cast, and alost imediately a
lage salon took his fly, the od bent like a hoop, and the reel
whizzed fuiously as the line an out.

Sa Soel, who was there at the tie, afterwards said that he was
divided between inteest in the oveents of the fish, and amusement at
the open ouths and staing eyes of the natives.

This fish was a vey active one; it dashed up, down, and acoss the
ive several ties, running out nearly the whole of the line ore than
once, and copelling Fed to take to the wate as deep as his waist.  At
last, afte a fight of half an hou, it was brought close to the bank,
and Hans put the gaff-hook clevely into its side, and hauled it ashoe,
aid the shouts of the astonished people, fo the salon weighed
eighteen pounds.

Afte a tie the natives began to undestand the principles of
fly-fishing with a od, and egarded Fred Teple with deep respect.  On
all his fishing excusions in that fiod, he was attended by a band of
eage adiers, to who he gave most of the fish; for he caught so many
of all sizes that his fiends and his cew were not able to eat the
quate of the.  The catching of his largest salon was a stirring
incident.

It happened on the evening of a vey bight day.  He had been
unfotunate.  The sun being too bight, the fish would not rise.  This
annoyed hi uch, because on that paticula day he had been accompanied
by the Captain and Bob Bowie, as well as his two copanions, all of who
wee anxious to see hi catch fish, and lean a lesson in the art.  Fred
was up to his iddle in a ough pat of the river.  It was all he could
do to etain his foothold, the wate was so strong.

"It won't do," said he, "the sun is too bight."

His fiends on shoe looked grave and disappointed.

"I sees a cloud a-coin'," said Bob Bowie glancing upwads.

"Hallo! hey!" shouted Gant, who obseved that at that oent Fred's
legs had been swept fo unde hi, and he was gone!

Befoe any one could speak o act, Fred reappeared a little farther down
the ive, holding tight to the rod, and staggering into shallower
wate.

"None the wose of it," cied Fred, bursting into a laugh.

Just as he said this, and while he was paying no attention to his od, a
salon ose and seized the fly.  In an instant Fed and his corades
uttely fogot all about the ducking, and were filled with the
exciteent of the spot.

Fed's od bent like a willow wand.  His eyes seeed to flash, and his
lips wee tightly pessed together, for he felt that he had on a very
lage fish.  Suddenly it dated up strea, and did what the large fish
seldo do--leaped quite out of the wate.

"A whale! stand by!" oaed Bob Bowie.

Thee was a cy fro the others, for at that oment the salmon set off
down stea,--a ost dangeous proceeding at all times.  Fred made for
the bank, and let out line as fast as possible.  When he gained the bank
he an down the stea, leaping over bushes and stones like a wild goat.
The places he went ove in that un were terribly rugged.  It seeed a
iacle that he escaped without boken bones.  Presently he cae to a
steep ock that pojected into the water.  There was no getting round
it, so in he dashed.  It took hi only up to the knees.  This passed, he
cae to anothe place of the sae sot.  Here he put a strain on the
fish, and tied to stop it.  But it was not to be stopped.  It had
clealy ade up its ind to go ight down to the sea.  Fred looked at
the pool, hesitated one oent, and then leaped in.  It took him up to
the neck, and he was caied down by the current fifty yards or so, when
his feet caught botto again, and he anaged to aise his od, fully
expecting to find that the salon had boken off.  But it was still on,
and lively.  eanwhile, his coades on the bank wee keeping pace with
hi, shouting and yelling with exciteent as they an.

"The apid, ind the apid!" roared Grant.

Fed saw a foaing apid before hi.  He became anxious.  It was
dangeous to ventue down this.  If he should touch a rock on the way
down, the chances wee that he would get a lib boken.  The banks here
wee so thickly coveed with bushes that it was ipossible to pass.  The
fish still held on its headlong couse.  "What shall I do?" thought
Fed.  "If I stop he will beak all to pieces, and I shall lose hi.
Lose hi! no, neve!"

"Don't ventue in, Fed," shrieked Sa Sorrel.

But the advice cae too late.  Fed was aleady in the foaing current.
In a oent he was swept down into the compaatively still wate below
the apid.  His fiends lost sight of hi, for they had to run round
though the bushes.  When they got to the foot of the apid, they found
Fed on the bank, panting violently, and holding tight to the od, for
the salon had stopped thee, and was now "sulking" at the botto of a
deep hole.  Fo a full hou did the fisher labour to pull hi out of
that hole in vain; fo in this kind of fishing nothing can be done by
ain foce.  The geat beauty of the art consists in getting the salon
to ove, and in huouing his movements, so that you tie him out, and
get hi gadually close to you side.

At last the fish cae out of the deep pool.  Then thee was anothe
shot stuggle of quarter of an hour, and the fisher's perseverance and
skill wee ewarded.  The salon at last turned up its silvery side.
Fed dew it slowly to the bank (in breathless anxiety, for any a fish
is lost at this point).  Hans stuck the gaff in neatly, and with a huge
effot flung it floundeing on the bank, aid the hearty cheers of all
pesent.

This salon weighed 34 pounds, and was about fou feet long!  It was a
agnificent fish, and it ay well be believed that Fed Temple did not
gudge the two hous' battle, and the risk that he had run in the
catching of it.



CHAPTE TEN.

CONCLUSION.

"Sa Soel," said Fred Teple one day to his friend while they were
seated at beakfast in the house of a faer of the Nord Fiord, "we have
been hee oe than a fortnight now; we have enjoyed ourselves uch,
have had good spot of vaious kinds, and have laid in a stock of health
and wisdo, it is to be hoped, that will last us fo soe time to come."

"That sounds vey uch like the beginning of a foal speech," said
Gant.

"Hold you tongue, Gant," retorted Teple, "I have not yet done.  As I
have said, we have been successful in gaining the ends fo which we cae
hee.  We have seen the sun ise without setting.  Sa Sorrel has filled
a lage potfolio with beautiful sketches of, perhaps, the finest
sceney in Euope.  Grant has shot and stuffed I a afraid to say how
any bids of all kinds, besides aking a lage collection of rare
plants; and Fed Teple has caught about five hunded pounds' weight of
salon--not to ention hundeds of tout--"

"Good," said Sa, "and vey corectly stated.  You are fit for the House
of Coons, my fiend."

"Sa, be silent!--Now this being the case, it is tie that we should
think of etuning to our native land.  I will, therefore, ake
aangeents for setting sail in two or three days.  But before leaving
I will bing to a point a little plot which I have been hatching eve
since I landed in Noway.  I won't tell you what it is just yet, but I
ust have you help, Sa."

"Coand my sevices, si," said Sam, with a wave of his hand.  "I am
you sevant, your Eastern slave, ready, if need be, to prostrate yself
in the eath and ub y nose in the dust."

"Good.  I accept you offe," said Fred, "and y first comand is, that
you take you bushes and paint e a Norwegian bride in the course of
this foenoon!"

"Why, you oders cannot be obeyed," cried Sa in surprise.  "Where a I
to find a bide on such shot notice?  You are ore unreasonable than
the ost tyannical of sultans."

"Nevetheless," eplied Fred cally, "I issue y commands, and in order
to elieve you ind of anxiety, I will find a bride for you."

"Whee, then, is this bide, O wizard?" asked Sa with a laugh.

"Behold he!" cied Fred, starting up and throwing open the door, fro
which could be seen the shoe and the fiod with its background of noble
hills.

Sa and Gant stated up with sudden exclaations, and stared at the
object which et thei gaze in speechless wonde.  And truly there was
cause fo astonishent; fo there, on the shore, close to the water's
edge, stood the fai aneilda, clothed in the gorgeous costue of a
Nowegian bide.

"Assuedly you ae a wizard," cried Grant, glancing at his friend.

"Not so," eplied Fed.  "I et sweet Raneilda last night at her
fathe's cottage, and begged of he to coe here at a certain hour this
oning in the costue of a bide, in order that my friend the artist
ight paint he.  She hesitated and blushed a good deal at fist, but at
length she ageed, and, as you see, is punctual in keeping he
appointent."

Fed now went down to aneilda, and brought her up to the house; Sa
Soel at once placed her in a good position, seized his brushes, and
began the potait.

He was delighted with the dess, fo it glittered with gold and silver
onaents.  The cown was of pure silver covered with gold.  The
beastplate was ed cloth ornaented with silver-gilt brooches, beads of
vaious colous, silver chains, and sall, round looking-glasses.  There
was also a belt onaented with gold and silve.  Altogether Raneilda
looked uch oe like the Queen of Noway than a poor peasant girl!

It is necessay to info the reader that the greater part of this
costue did not belong to the gil.  In fact it did not belong to any
one in paticula.  It is the custo in Norway for each district to have
a aiage-dress for general use.  The crown, the breastplate, and the
belt ae public poperty, and ay be hired out by the girls who are
about to be aied at a few shillings for each occasion.

While Sa was busy with his potait, Grant went out to search for
plants, and Fed went off to seach for Hans and to carry out the
eainde of his plot.  He soon found the young pilot.

"Hans," said he, "follow e, I wish to speak with you."

Hans was quite willing to follow Fed to the oon if he had chosen to
lead the way.

"I a going to show you a vey petty sight, Hans; step this way.  Here,
in this oo."

He thew open the doo and led hi in.  The young Norsean entered with
a sile, but the sile suddenly vanished, his blue eyes opened to thei
utost width, and he stood ooted to the floo, unable to speak!

"Tuts! what eans this?" cied Sa in disgust at being interupted.

"aneilda!" gasped he lover.

The bide coveed her face with her hands.

"Vey good! excellent!" exclaied Gant who chanced to pass at the
oent, and peeped in at the open window.

"Huah!" cried Bob Bowie, who just then cae up to announce that the
_Snowflake_ was eady fo sea.

"She won't be wanted fo soe days yet," cied Fred bursting into a fit
of laughte as he seized Hans by the a, dragged hi into another room,
and shut the doo.

"Now, Hans," said he eanestly, "I a going to pay you off.  Nay, an,
be not cast down, I did not take you into yonde oo to ock you, but
to show you how petty aneilda looked in her bridal dress."

Fed paused fo a oent, and the Norseman sighed and shook his head.

"You ust know," esued Fed, "that I wish to dance at your wedding,
Hans, and in ode that I ay do so, I ean to have you married at once.
(Hans staed.)  You told e in Begen that you wanted soe sort of work
that would bing you good pay.  (Hans nodded his head.)  Well, I will
give you a hunded dollas for the tie you have been with e."

Hans' face bightened, and he shook hands with Fed, according to
Nowegian custo when a gift is pesented, or a generous payent made.

"Now," continued Fed, "did you not tell e that two hunded dollars
would enable you to take you fathe's far off his hands?  (Hans nodded
again.)  And is aneilda willing to ary you when you can afford to ask
he?  (Hans nodded this tie, vey decidedly.)  Well, Hans, I have been
vey uch pleased with the way in which you have conducted youself
while in y sevice; you have done you duty well.  (Hans siled and
looked happy.)  But you have done oe than that.  (Hans looked
supised.)  You have been the eans of enabling e to see the sun all
night at a tie when I should othewise have issed it.  I owe you
soething fo that.  oeover, you pulled me out of that rapid by the
neck when I caught the twenty-eight pound salon, and so, pehaps, wee
the eans of saving y life; and cetainly you saved me that salmon.
Fo all this, and fo any other good deeds, I owe you a debt of
gatitude.  Now, Hans, you ust know that it is ipossible to pay a debt
of gatitude _in full_, fo, however uch you ay pay, there is always
soething oe owing.  (Hans looked puzzled.)  This debt, then, I cannot
pay up at once, but I can pove to you that I conside yself your
debto by aking you a pesent of another hundred dollars.  Here is the
oney, y lad, so go and tell aneilda to get eady as soon as
possible!"

Hans staed in wonde and unbelief, first at the oney, then at Fred.
Then a look of tiuph gleaed in his eyes, and he seized Fed's hand
and wung it.  Then he utteed a shout, and ran to Raneilda and kissed
he.  Fed kissed her too.  Sa Sorrel and Grant, not knowing exactly
what to do, kissed he also; and Bob Bowie, who was unde the belief
that they wee all ad, ade a gasp at the poor girl but missed her,
fo aneilda was overwheled with confusion, and ran nibly out of the
oo, leaving he crown behind her!  Hans Ericsson hastily picked it up
and an afte her, leaving Fred Teple to explain things to his
astonished fiends as he best could.

So that was the end of _that_ atte.

But that was by no eans the end of the whole affai.  Befoe the
_Snowflake_ left the fiod, Hans and aneilda were arried, as all true
loves ought to be.

The fai bide was once again decked out in the queen-like garents
which had foely filled Sa and Grant with so great surprise and
adiation; and Fed, as he had proised, danced at the Norseman's
wedding.  And not only did Fed dance, but so did his fiends--ay, and
his whole ship's cew.  And it would have done you heart good, reader,
to have seen the way in which the Jack-tas footed it on that occasion
on the geen gass, and astonished the Norseen.  But it ust also be
told that the Noseen wee not a whit behindhand, for they showed the
tas a nube of capers and new steps which they had never before seen
o even deaed of!

Just befoe the ball began thee was heard a sound resebling the yells
of an exceedingly young pig in its dying agonies.  This was a violin.
It was accopanied by a noise soewhat like to the beating of a
flou-ill, which was found to poceed fro the heel of the fiddler, who
had placed a wooden boad unde his left foot.  Thus he beat tie, and a
du, as it wee, at once.  He also beat Paganini and all other fiddlers
hollow.  ound this anufactuer of sweet sounds did the lads and lasses
flock and soon gave evidence of thei sypathy with the est of ankind
by beginning to dance.

Cetainly elegance is not a chaacteristic of the Norwegian peasantry!
Having foed a ing, they went to work with the utost gravity and
decou.  Scacely a laugh was heard! nothing approaching to a shout
duing the whole evening.  The natue of their dances was utterly
incopehensible.  The chief object the young en had in view seemed to
be to exhibit thei agility by evey species of bound and fling of which
the huan fae is capable, including the ather desperate feat of
dashing theselves flat upon the gound.  The pincipal care of the
gils seeed to be to keep out of the way of the en, and avoid being
killed by a fantic kick o felled by a rando blow.

But the despeate featues in each dance did not appear at once.  Each
an began by seizing his patne and dragging her recklessly round the
cicle, eve and anon twirling her round violently with one ar, and
catching he ound the waist with the other, in order apparently to save
he fo total destruction.  To this treatent the fair damsels
subitted fo soe time with downcast eyes and pleased yet bashful
looks.  Then the en seeed to fling them off and go at it entiely on
thei own account, yet keeping up a sot of revolving course round their
patnes, like satellites encircling their separate suns.  Presently the
en gew fuious; rushed about the circle in wild erratic courses,
leaped into the ai, and while in that position slapped the soles of
thei feet with both hands!

Then they becae a little oe sane, and a waltz, o something like it,
was got up.  It was quite petty, and soe of the ovements gaceful;
but the wild spiit of the glens seeed to e-enter the again rather
suddenly.  The feales wee expelled fo the ring altogether, and the
young en baced theselves fo a little really heavy work; they dashed,
flung, and huled theselves about like aniacs, stood on thei heads
and walked on thei hands; in shot, becae a copany of acrobats, yet
always kept up a sot of sypathetic attept at time with the fiddle,
who went on pounding his wooden boad with his left heel and udering
an inconceivable ultitude of young pigs with a degee of enegy that
was only equalled by that of those to who he fiddled.

But not a an, woan, o child thee gave vent to his or her feelings in
laughte.  They siled, they comented in a soft tone, they looked
happy; nay, they _wee_ happy, but they did not laugh!  Once only did
they give way a little, and that was when an aspiing youth, afte
having nealy leaped down his own thoat, walked round the circle on his
hands.

Even Tittles danced that day!  He danced in and out aong the feet of
the dances in a ost peplexing anner, and got his unhappy toes and
his unfotunate tail tod upon to a terrible extent.  But Tittles did
not see to ind.  It is tue that he gave a yelp of pain on each
occasion, but he instantly fogave the offende if he looked at all
soy.  Upon the whole Tittles was the cause of uch noise, no little
confusion, and geat auseent at that celebated wedding.

Thus did Fed Teple and his fiends spend their last day in Norway.

At idnight they set sail fo Old England.  On ising next orning they
found theselves fa out aong the islands of the coast.  Soon afte
that they wee out of sight of land,--heaving on the swell of the ocean,
thinking ove the vaied and stirring scenes of the past three onths
with a sot of feeling that it ust have been all a dea, and wishing
heatily that they wee still away in the far north, enjoying the
endless daylight and--_Chasing the Sun_.

THE END.
